Hey Friends. I am headed to Brazil at the end of August - September for 3 weeks and have a few things booked at the beginning, but am looking for suggestions of what to do at the end of the trip. (Solo F - 33yrs)

I fly into SP and booked a flight for a couple hours after I land, to Rio for 4 nights, 3 full days. From there I'm hittin a plane ride to Iguazu Falls, where I will be for 3 nights and 2.5 days. From there, I'm catching an early flight to Salvador de Bahia where I want to hang for about 3ish days. This is where I'm a bit stuck with my remaining 9 days. 

I'm  thinking about three options but am VERY open to any and all suggestions:  
1. I could head to Recife for about 3 days before heading to Fernando de Noronha for 4-5 nights before heading back to SP to fly home.   
2. Going to Chapada Diamantina for 4ish+ days, and then head to Recife for about 3-4 days and hit the beaches around there; issue here is I feel like 12+ hours on a bus (round trip) is a lot of time wasted in transport but it looks incredible!   
3. Hit Chapada Diamantina and Morro de São Paulo and beaches around Salvador.

Context: 

I'm in the US, my carrier is Verizon, my phone (Pixel 6) is able to use an eSIM (pretty sure, anyway). I'll be visiting Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Currently considering the Airalo European 3GB/30 days plan.

Questions:

* With Airalo, since I'll only have data, I can use WhatsApp, Signal, maps, browse Reddit, email, etc. but can*not* use regular ol' SMS or phone calling. Right?
* How does making calls via WhatsApp work? Can I do that with Airalo? Is that included in the data I pre-purchased? What phone number does it use?
* I also see Google Fi recommended a fair bit. The plan with international calling and whatnot is $40 a month. I won't come remotely close to needing an unlimited plan, so is there any other reason why I should still consider Google Fi over Airalo?

travel,"Hello

I'm a 17 y/o highschooler who is about to graduate. As a gift, my mom is taking me to explore some of Europe. Most of the trip it will just be me walking around by myself as my mom will have to work from hotel rooms. I'm planning on going for about 23 days from late march to late June. It will probably be closer to 21 full days in Europe once traveling time is subtracted. 

I guess what I'm asking for is what places can I go where I can just explore relatively safely as a minor. I'm also looking for how many countries I should try and squeeze in, as id like to explore more than one but I also don't want to spend too little time in an area to the point where it doesn't really feel like I've been there. For reference here are the European countries I've been to before as well as the ones I wouldn't be apposed to going to again.

Countries ive been: Iceland, Uk, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Albania, and Greece 

Countries id like to explore more: Switzerland, Italy, Greece

Id like most the countries I visit to be ones I've been to before, but like I said I would be fine spending a little bit more time there. So far, my mom has put forward this route along the railroad:

Fly into Berlin -&gt; Poland (Wroclaw) -&gt; Prague -&gt; Munich -&gt; Luxembourg -&gt; Belgium -&gt; Netherlands -&gt;Denmark -&gt; Norway -&gt; Sweden -&gt; Back to Berlin for flight. That's a little less than 3 days per area not including travel time. Is this realistic or should we shorten the country list?

travel,"Hi all!

I'm about to start my solo travels shortly, for about a year, to South East Asia, Oceana, and South America.

I wanted to get people's thoughts on footwear, in particular the Hoka Mach 5 as a daily shoe (never owned a Hoka before). I have slightly wider feet and a higher mid-foot than the average person I would say, so I'll probably go to a specialist store for additional insight just in case, but wanted to get the expert opinion here.

My use case would mainly be for walking. I also was considering trail runners such as the Adidas Terrex line, but because some of my trails later in the year might be more challenging (such as Machu Picchu), I am considering separate hiking footwear. While versatility for light trails would obviously have been good, I think that I am good with sacrificing this for more comfort for day-to-day slow travel -  I assume an Adidas Terrex would be less comfortable walking than a Hoka for example. I do not mind packing an additional pair of footwear as going ultralight is not as big of a priority as comfort for me and my backpack has enough space to accommodate this.

In summary, I'm happy (and currently leaning towards) getting a pair of trainers, sandals, and hiking footwear, and day-to-day comfort is what I wanted to prioritise for my main/daily shoe.

travel,"I'm so mad because I was supposed to have a paid for flight (or significantly reduced flight) to Greece to meet my sister during her halfway point in deployment, but they cancelled it last minute. (Basically the Canadian military said sisters arent important enough only mommies and daddies can go, and we do not talk to ours.) She still wants me to go, but flight prices are INSANE.

Basically, where I live in Eastern Canada, it costs ≈$400+ to fly anywhere than it would from Montreal or Toronto, so I've been looking at flights out of those 2 cities.(From my city to Athens it *says* it's $1465 RT but everytime I go to book it it goes up to $1697).

The cheapest flight that I've been looking at from Toronto to Athens RT is only $1099, but it has a 24 hour layover in Montreal both ways. I live close enough to Montreal that I can drive relatively cheaply, so if I could fly out of Montreal for this price that would be perfect. Otherwise I'd have to buy a separate RT to Toronto (≈$200)

BUT if I search for the same flights just without the Toronto part, it goes up to $1349 RT, from just Montreal to Athens, which is incredibly frustrating. 

I'm like. A super poor person that lives paycheck to paycheck and does some slightly sketchy things just to get groceries every month, so this trip is seriously going to hurt me financially. My hopes were so high knowing I'd have a chance to go to Europe and then they pulled it out right underneath me and I feel like a complete fool. I feel bad for my sister who already booked the hotel and everything for the 2 weeks she has off and we've been planning this for forever since it's her only break in 6 months so I feel like I can't back out of it. I'm also sick as fuck of the only travel advice online being ""book years in advance!"" Or ""save $ by not eating out!"". I'm lucky I have 1.5 months advance, and eating out is simply something I never do since I can only afford to live off of oatmeal and PB toast.

I dont see too many updates posted in this forum for Third Party Horror Stories so I'm hoping that this will help other people who have been screwed over. 

A few days after what happened at the hotel, I reached out to Priceline throughout my holiday multiple times through text and email to try and find some resolution. One of the Priceline representatives went so far and claimed that there were attempts made to contact me of the
cancellation and that I even authorized and approved this cancellation. When asked for records of these contact attempts, the
representative dismissed my request and essentially told me “too bad too sad.” I also tried submitting an formal complaint via Pricelines feedback website and they said ""We reviewed your issue again to confirm that we did not overlook anything that might support a more favorable resolution."" 😒

Anyways, I was also going back and forth with the hotel corporate office regarding what exactly had happened and I hadn't heard back from the travel insurance company yet. According to the hotel, the reservation was cancelled bc ""There was an issue with the rate being confirmed on the travel agent system and the hotel is not able to accept the
booking since the rate is incorrect,"" which sounds like Priceline just made up their own price?? WTF. 

After coming back from my trip, I looked into some of the legal options such as small claims and arbitration and then I came across the BBB (just google priceline BBB or expedia BBB, etc). I'm not sure how it works exactly but it is a free service and it seems like they act as a mediator between the 2 parties. I saw other peoples complaints and the resolutions provided and figured I would try it before taking the legal route. Side note, I also submitted a complaint against Expedia for an incident that happened last year, which was resolved very quickly and I got a full refund from them. 

After some back and forth with Priceline, they offered to refund the difference between the original booking and the new booking (~$460) in the form of a check. I tried asking for a refund for the full amount since I had to spend my holiday with limited funds and I wasnt able to get the full experience of my trip, but they said no. 🙄

At any rate, I was able to recover the out of pocket expense without going the legal route, so not a total loss. I just have to wait for the check to come in the mail. I still haven't heard from the travel insurance as they are really backed up....

I hope this helps others, but ultimately, lesson learned, I'm definitely staying tf away from these companies. 🙁",UPDATE My hotel reservation was cancelled and nobody told me,,,126xmvj,,self.travel,0,1680206537,2023-03-30 20:02:17

One thought is a manual Razor scooter (we used these for the kids when they were ages 4-10/12 and it went well but this was in NYC and DC not Europe), it would save him steps and we can easily fold it up and carry it when we are on public transport or in museums, etc…Has anyone tried anything like this in Europe? Or maybe even a skateboard? I want to buy it now so he has some weeks to practice. Any ideas or advice very welcome, this is my kids (19 and 21) first real European trip and he will be sad if he causes any restrictions. He doesn’t need anything such as a seated scooter and would unfortunately rather tough it out than use something like that mainly because of the bulk and not being injured to that degree.",European trip with knee and back pain??,advice,,126x34a,,self.travel,0,1680205236,2023-03-30 19:40:36

**Option A**
-Train from Budapest to Salzburg, 2 nights in Salzburg
-Train from Salzburg to Vienna, 4 nights in Vienna
-Day trip from Vienna to Hallstatt during the 4 nights stayed in Vienna.

**Option B**
-Train from Budapest to Vienna, 2 nights in Vienna
-Train from Vienna to Salzburg, 2 nights in Salzburg
-Travel from Salzburg to Hallstatt (day trip), Hallstatt to Vienna, 2 nights in Vienna.

My thoughts: I am siding towards Option A. While we would be passing through Vienna on a longer train ride en route to Salzburg, I am not crazy about the idea of setting up in a city, leaving after 2 days, just to come back 2 days later.

travel,"This October, I’m going to Japan for an exchange semester. The last weeks, I’ve been sketching out a “little” trip for the time after that semester.

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Starting from Singapore, I want to travel back home to Berlin without going by plane.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve figured out 2 routes + 1 alternative, which seem to be doable. These are not final yet though, since I might want to stay a few days in some places or visit some more. For the routes, I just focused on finding a way home. In general, I’d rather take the train than going by bus, even if it is a little more expensive (but not overly expensive) or takes more time. I also wanted to avoid going to Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_zVg2KZfXBckAvVjiAiQvHFFs5zzti5ZWk28ePZn4o/edit?usp=sharing) with the most important information (I’m quite proud of it tbh \^\^’)

Route 2 would probably be my most desired route, since I always wanted to visit Nepal, but it got quite some gaps in the public transportation department with the biggest problem being, that there isn’t really a good way to cross the border between Myanmar and India by public transport. I could imagine myself going to hike to the Nepal-China border (if possible, of course).

Route 1 &amp; 2 share the same big public transport gap between Aktau and Kuryk.

Route 1.5 would be the alternative, since it would include Nepal and avoid any big transportation gaps. But I would have to take the plane back home to Berlin.

&amp;#x200B;

The most information for this has been gathered through [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) and [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/index.html).

I you guys have any ideas for a better route or even solutions for my transport gaps, please feel free to share them. Also, feedback and other recommendations are appreciated too.

&amp;#x200B;

*One more thing:*

For now, I’ve been planning just for myself, but if anybody is interested, I’m looking for travel buddies, that might be crazy enough to join my journey. Feel free to contact me :)

travel,"Hey everyone!

I have a quick question about my US passport.

Backstory: I am a US/Italy citizen, flying from the US back to Italy. I DON'T have an Italian passport, only an American one. A

About three and a half months ago, I applied to have my American passport renewed online (which means I keep my old passport rather than send it in). This is when the maximum expected wait time was 9 weeks, which gave me a comfortable 3 extra weeks in case it was late. Because it hadn't arrived earlier this week, I followed procedure on the State Department website and called the number to have them expedite it. I was told it should be done within a few days. That was Monday, and there is no change today (Thursday). 

My question is: Does anyone know if I can fly on a passport that isn't expired? I can't find information on the State Dept website as to whether or not the passport becomes invalid as soon as I apply for a new one.

Follow up: This is pure hope, but does the State Dept issue and ""Whoops, our bad, this person can actually fly"" document in cases like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't imagine I'll have much, if any, trouble getting back into Italy since I have an ID card, and that's all I've needed every other time I have made the trip. But they might not let me leave is the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I can't just wait until the passport is ready. I have obligations in Italy and I can't extend my stay in my sublet in the States.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all!","US Passport Question: Passport hasn't arrived, leaving in 5 days",question,,126owd2,,self.travel,0,1680186839,2023-03-30 14:33:59

Hi all,

I am ideally looking for advice for getting a bus from Split Croatia, to Mostar Bosnia and Herzegovina at the beginning of June this year.

I understand in this region it’s usually best to just show up at the bus station and try get a ticket, however because this is a popular route for tourists I thought about booking online. (Flixbus, Croatia bus etc)

I remember a few weeks ago I seen some available routes but now they are gone.

Does this likely mean even if I try get a ticket at the station they’ll be booked out? Or will it still probably be okay?

I also understand that this is 3 months away and some schedules may not be released, etc

travel,"Hello! We are two lady artists (composer and painter) that are taking a Europe trip. 

We are medium-packers; we have our creative supplies and our personal things, so we're not packing light enough to be backpacking for instance. Because of our gear, I'd prefer to do only several moves, not many frequent ones.

We booked an apartment in Bologna for a month to be able to have a hub for work and to be able to spoke out for 1-2 day trips to neighboring cities. This way, we could even leave most of our things and pack an overnight bag. We feel confident about that portion of the trip.

We're wondering if we should pick another hub area for the \~18 days before we are in Bologna, or move between a couple places for about a week or so.

Would like to stay around $6,000 for 2 people, three weeks in June, including places to stay, food, fun, and any smaller transit (short flights, intercity trains).

I think hostels COULD work for some of our stays, but only ones where I can secure my violin &amp; electronics. AirBnB's, mid-range hotels, or private rooms could be good options.

Some areas of consideration:

* Zagreb &amp; Dubrovnik, Croatia
* Paris
* Lisbon
* Naples

We definitely want to do a short trip to Naples if we don't end up staying there longer, but it could be after our Bologna stay.

We would love to explore local restaurants, arts &amp; culture, live music, historical sites.","2 artists, ~4 bags. Medium packers. Staying in Bologna as a hub for one month (6/18-7/20).

travel,"I had a reservation for an international flight tomorrow morning. It was a two leg trip, the first flight was delayed by 90 mins which meant I would miss my connection for the second flight. The airline offered alternatives, but I contacted them (via their website chat) to ask about getting an aisle seat and possibly a free upgrade to a comfort seat as there were no aisle seats available on the alternate flights. Somehow the agent in the chat canceled and refunded my reservation without my permission and without any confirmation. I only learned about this when I called the airline after the chat agent tried to transfer me to a ticket specialist and never heard anything.

I'm on hold now with the airline trying to find me a comparable flight but I don't think they'll be able to find anything for the price I initially paid seeing as this is now a next-day international flight and they say they are unable to price match since my original reservation was refunded. There are also no return flights for my original dates which means I'll either lose out on money spent for my accommodations by coming back early or need to spend more money on accommodations coming back later.

I've never heard of anything like this before and it's not the typical flight cancellation by the airline. The flights are still there but my reservation was canceled without my consent or permission. Am I entitled to anything here??

travel,"I'll start by saying I have never traveled, not even the planning or research.  It's just never been possible for me.  I'm just asking this out of curiosity.  International flights are expensive.  I maintain that assertion even going back to before high inflation and COVID.  It was around 2015 I looked up international flight prices for the first time.  Everyone knows about how a typical Westerner can go to places like SE Asia and have very lavish visits because of the much lower cost of goods and services there.  My first flight search was done to see if that rule also applied to flying.  I wanted to compare similar flight distances to various countries.  From what I see, it does not change the price that much.  Yet, somehow people from these poorer countries are able to do some international traveling of their own.  Is this because citizens of those countries are able to get cheaper flights with their airlines?  Or is there some other explanation?",Are flights cheaper in poorer countries?,question,,126abfq,,self.travel,0,1680147668,2023-03-30 03:41:08

travel,"Hi all, I had a trip planned to go to Europe leaving 5/27, and right before booking the flight, I decided to check my passport and make sure everything is in order. Lo and behold, there’s brown mildew spots on almost every page, including yellow discoloration over the top of my info page. PSA: don’t store passport in an airtight lockbox. 

I went to my local international airport, and a lady at tsa said it was fine, but I don’t want to risk it. The issue is, even if expedited, it looks like new passports can take 9+ weeks to be delivered. I was thinking about booking an appointment at a passport agency, but it’s impossible to get through to that number. 

As it stands, it looks like I have 3 options. I could book the trip and risk it with the moldy passport, I could book the trip and get a new passport, hoping it’s delivered on time(maybe get trip insurance), or I could just cancel the trip. I also don’t have the option of pushing the trip back. Are there any other options?

travel,"Hi all, we are traveling from the US to Europe. Flying KLM to AMS, then train to Frankfurt, then Lufthansa flight to Lisbon, and finally return Porto&gt;CDG&gt;USA flights. 

Since we will be traveling some on trains, we want to travel light. The entire trip is 3 weeks but we will have accomodations where we can do laundry.

My wife has a 25"" Travelpro suitcase that has great wheels on it even after many years. So we wanted to get some smaller carry-on sized Travelpro (Crew) spinners with really good wheels. This will allow us to walk a mile or so from train stations to lodging, also make it easier to travel light on trains.

So question - Travelpro isn't that cheap compared to our previous Samsonite/etc. They seem to have 22"", 21"", and 20"" rollers/spinners. We checked out the 22 and 21 and compared their dimensions to the official luggage allowances for carryons with our airlines and even the 21 is ***technically*** too large when including wheels. Yet getting down to the 20"", that is pretty tiny.

We could check our rollers on the flights and still be light for the trains, but it would be nice to just carry them onto our flights. So the question is - I know that we might be technically violating size limits on Delta/KLM/Lufthansa/Air France, but how strict are these airlines?

travel,"Hello. 

So long story short. I have nearly 30K in the bank. And I am currently 27 years old and have never lived on my own. My college years and adolescent years in short have haunted to me to this day. If I sound overdramatic. I apologize but how it went down still bothers me. And if you're wondering, I've been dealing with immense mental health issues since the pandemic. Counseling is ongoing. 

I want a setting where I can be free of any responsibility. I desire a setting where yes. I can have irresponsible immature and youthful fun. Basically, I want a space where I can feel like the 19 year old I never got to be even if it is for a very brief moment. 

I'll be real. The reason traveling and staying in hostels appeal to me is simply cause they resemble a college dorm room. 

Will it exactly be like college? I know that is a hard no. And I know I won't really make any long term friendships from this. And you know what? I don't desire to. I am in no mood for anything serious in my life right now. Frankly, I don't care if I whomever is staying in my hostel is a doctor and I don't care to know about that person's career. I've had an incredibly sheltered life so far, and the only thing I care about is having fun. Again, being the 19 and 21 year old I never got to be is my priority. I want that type of fun I wanted my college years should of been. I don't care how shallow and meaningless the partying is. Pleasure is the only thing I desire right now. 

I have doubts if my 30K will last me more than a year but I'll try to make the most of what I got. I have thought about pursuing being a paralegal or aviation after if I go down this route.

travel,"
I feel that travel isn’t really for me. I’m 28, and really haven’t had many opportunities to travel before. I can count how many times I’ve been on a plane with one hand, and have never left North America.

While I always wanted to travel when I was young, it just didn’t happen. My family really couldn’t afford it, and I’ve never been able to just leave my job and go somewhere for weeks at a time. There also seems to be kind of an annoying “culture” among traveling that rubs me the wrong way. I feel like I’m constantly having to hear from coworkers and acquaintances about all of the places they’ve gone (with the conversation usually turning into some sort of competition to see who has gone to more places or traveled more). Some may even give you a hard time if you tell them that you don’t travel. I used to be ashamed by it when I was a kid, but it doesn’t bother me as much as it used to. 

My partner is from a country in Asia, and she really wants me to go there on a vacation with her. I could see myself traveling with her, but at the same time I could take it or leave it. I’m good with just staying home or letting her do it herself. I also worry about what could go wrong (getting lost, having a health problem abroad, etc) and it just seems easier for me not to go. 

Does anyone else feel the way I do?",Looking for some motivation to travel. Does anyone have any advice?,question,,1263go8,,self.travel,0,1680130236,2023-03-29 22:50:36

travel,"If you're planning to fly with Turkish Airlines anytime soon, you might want to think twice after hearing about my experience with them. I recently took a flight from San Francisco to Mumbai and back, and let's just say that it wasn't the smoothest ride I've ever had.

For starters, on one of my flights, they separated me and my travelling partner on one leg of the flight. This was a major problem for us because my partner has mobility issues and need6ed assistance. They wheeled him away, and we were supposed to meet at the next gate. However, when we reunited, I found out that he had purchased a business class upgrade for $1300, after they told him it was $300. The flight attendants were of no help, so I contacted customer service. Unfortunately, it's been two weeks, and I haven't received a response yet.

To add insult to injury, on all the legs of my flight, the ""extra legroom"" seats I had paid extra for all had bassinets for babies. The airline neglected to mention this when I purchased them on the phone. As a result, I was asked to move to a normal sized seat on two out of four flights so that a family could sit together. 
On the other two flights, I had a baby right in front of me, one of which was unfortunately very sick. I contracted COVID-19 after that flight, despite wearing a mask. The baby's caregivers were asleep most of the time, and the baby often rested his head on my shoulder, which was not a pleasant experience.
I was not mad at the baby, poor little guy. 

When I asked for a refund for the extra legroom seats I gave up, the airline claimed they had no record of me being asked to move and refused to provide a refund. So they denied my request. 

 I also had issues with my meal request - I had ordered a vegan meal, but all my dishes had cheese. When I informed the stewards and stewardesses, they insisted it was vegan, even though it wasn't. 

I wrote to customer service about this, and they requested a note from my doctor stating that I am vegan, which I found odd. I did provide the note, to which they then responded, ""issue resolved'. 

Overall, the flight was decent, but the customer service was abysmal. The responses I received seemed as though they were written by people who love the books of Franz Kafka. 

It's disappointing that I couldn't talk to anyone about my issues, and the fact that they neglected to mention the bassinets in the ""extra legroom"" seats was unacceptable.

 If you're flying with Turkish Airlines, my advice would be to not rely on the on-board flight attendants to resolve any issues and brace yourself for a frustrating experience.",turkish airlines worst customer service ever?,advice,,1262u0q,,self.travel,0,1680128793,2023-03-29 22:26:33

Online sources all sort of contradict eachother with what is/ isn't required for people of our age when traveling without somone who is 18 years old. 

A general consesus we have came too is that we need a letter of conset from our parents as well as all documentation as a standard traveler would need. The airline we will be flying on also had vaugely mentioned something about having somone to meet when you land, we were confused on if this applies to everyone and if it will hinder our travel if we say he have no one to meet in Germany when we land.

 We are planning to stay in hostles but are unsure about the ability of 17 year olds to book/check into them, some say that you only have to be older then say 14 and some dont specify. We know it will vary from hostle to hostle. Are they very strict about the age and how do they verify it, if it is a strict process how common are hostles that accomadate youth?

travel,"Hi everyone,

So I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on where to travel in the Caribbean between December and January.

So my gf and I are planning on escaping the dark european winter months for a while and spend 3 weeks in the Caribbean Sea. It’s the first time for us around there.
The rainy season seems to be over by then and I guess the weather should be fine at the turn of the year.

Activity wise we’d like to go hiking and see some nature, snorkelling but a day or two at the beach are welcome as well. Experiencing local cuisine is definitely on our list too.

Our main questions are:

1. Which islands are accessible by flight from europe?
2. Are the islands properly linked by boats? And is it easily possible to arrive at one point and leave from another island?
3. What are the expenses to expect in comparison to southeast asia for exemple?
4. What's generally useful to know before going there?
5. Which are the points that were disappointing? (if there are any) and what's to avoid?

Any advice towards which islands and/or  travel routes are recommendable for 3 weeks of time and which places to stay at are highly appreciated!
I’d say we are travelling on a medium budget. I worked enough to not spend the night in a 20 people dorm, however we’d like to avoid paying 6k for a week in a fancy suit.

* Mostly want to visit historical sites, try a ton of food
* Accessible transportation methods (can't walk much or stay up for a long time because of health condition)
* More physical stuff like hiking or climbing is not doable. However, activities like kayaking would be fine since legs aren't really required.
* On the cheaper side if possible
* English is usable in a worst case scenario
* Friendly and easy to talk to people would be really nice
* Safe, I would like to leave more touristic places and go see what life in the countryside look like without having to worry too much

First of all. Uber is Cairo has been a breeze. And SO CHEAP! From downtown Cairo to the pyramids it cost a total of $3. Uber drivers for me have been nice older men in nicer cars than the taxi.

It is walkable almost like some of the European cities, yet in has a great deal of American atmosphere.

travel,"Hey everyone,

I'm super excited to plan my first solo trip and first time going to Europe this year. I will be visiting a few friends along the way, but I'll also take some time alone in some other cities.

I'll be traveling for about a month (32 days), and I plan to stay for at least 4 days in the 5 cities I have friends in (sums up to 20 days). That leaves in about 10 days to spent in other cities.

What I'm not sure if it really makes sense to spend 4 days in a single place (I don't really need this much time to see my friends), and also how many cities I can fit in these 30 days that makes to a healthy trip with enough days to have a good time in each city.

I'm curious to hear your experiences in Europe, tips to plan out where to go and how long to stay in each stop.


**More detailed info if you want to know more**

These are the cities I'll be visiting friends:
- Dublin
- London
- Stockholm
- Amsterdam
- Porto

travel,"Hey guys

I'm thinking of going to Turkey end of the year. 

So far.. I've got this plan:
- 6 days Kadikoy, Istanbul
- 5 days Cappadocia (split between Goreme / Ortahisar)
- 1 day Antalya (out of necessity with late flights.. just wanting to get to Kas.. is there a way to get there without the overnight stay here?)
- 4 days Kas 
- 2 days Karakoy, Istanbul (before the long journey home)

I'm pretty okay with the above. Just a bit unsure with the trip from Cappadocia to Kas to Istanbul. Wasn't planning to go but the Reddit reviews are too flattering! From what I've researched, it'd be best to stay in Antalya and then bus/drive to Kas the next morning? 

Also.. what's the best route from Kas back to Istanbul? I've read it's possible from both Dalaman and Antalya. 

Would bus or car hire be best? 

Would love to know if anyone has traveled this route and their thoughts on what's the best option to get from place to place?

Many thanks in advance!",Turkey travels.. Cappadocia to Kas to Istanbul..,,,125lwbs,,self.travel,2,1680090902,2023-03-29 11:55:02

We’ve just started planning our first trip to Italy as a family for late July/ early August. It’ll be my wife, 18 month old daughter and myself! 

We have a total of 11 days in Italy and looking to check out as much as possible but not rushed, travelling with a kid slows you down significantly haha! 

So far we had in mind the below path 

Rome -&gt; Naples -&gt; somewhere in Puglia (open to suggestions) -&gt; Florence -&gt; fly out of either Milan or Rome. 

My family love our food and also beautiful sights and sounds. We aren’t big on night life and would most likely not be driving unless necessary. We’ve heard train travel between big towns is best so that’s what we are leaning towards. Our budget is middle class if that makes sense lol, nothing overly fancy but also willing to spend on nice experiences! 

Any help or advice on which cities we should prioritise and how many days in each would be great. Also if it’s too jam packed, what would you take out?

Traveling in the US is expensive.

Even bad motels in the middle of nowhere cost shy of $100 bucks. You obviously need a car, and cities have no wow-factor besides a few ones, and the cuisine is also not abundantly amazing or cheap (example: $25 for a lobster roll vs a buffer of amazing cuisine in Mexico or Thailand).

Two questions come to mind that I'm hoping to get some guidance on here

* **Visa &amp; letter of invitation:** As a US citizen, I know that I can go through the e-Visa process that seems fairly straightforward. I'm trying to understand the best way to get the letter of invitation that appears to be required, however. I'm applying for an Algerian visa right now as well and they allow for a simple copy of a hotel reservation. My understanding for Uzbekistan is that an actual letter is required and a couple of the hotels I've come across specifically state that they no longer issue these letters. I tried inquiring with a couple of travel agencies in the country but they have not been terribly helpful. Anyone have any guidance/experience with this?
* **Aral Sea tours:** It seems that a guided tour is the only practical way of getting there. I've come across a few that are rather expensive ($800+ for 2-3 days) but I'm currently looking at a couple of cheaper tours offered by Islamek Travel. Does anyone have any experience with this company? I'm pretty willing to rough it for a couple of days if needed but am curious nonetheless.

travel,"I am aware that August is possibly the worst time to visit Spain, because it's hot and everyone is traveling, so some places are closed and others are very busy.  However, we will be in Europe in August, and are seriously considering moving to Spain sooner than originally thought, so I would like to use this opportunity to scout out some places or at least rule any of them out.  We'll be traveling as two adults and a 5 year old. 

Some questions: 

* I am fairly certain that Barcelona and Valencia are fine to visit in August, but what about other regions?  Should we skip Madrid because lots and lots of people leave, or in general?  Should we skip the south because the heat is intense, or is it not that bad?  Barcelona and Valencia are on our list because that's the likely area we'd move to and we'd like to check out the areas and schools, but I am not sure about then moving onto Madrid and Bilbao area, or Seville and Malaga area.  If any of those are good options to settle in as an expat family, that would be super helpful to narrow down the itinerary!
* Should we bother renting a car at all, or is it entirely not necessary?  My spouse will need to run at relatively high altitude through this trip, and I presume mountains are not super public transport friendly, but we could rent a car for the weekend as needed, or rent a car for a longer period if it's very handy to have for moving around.  It does seem to be a lot more expensive in Spain relative to, say, Germany, but maybe I'm not looking in the right places. 
* Our kid's birthday is in the middle of August - what memorable spot should we pick?  Amusement parks, or something else?  We previously planned to go to Europa Park before the plans changed. 
* We will need to get to Chamonix at the end of August.  By this point, we'll probably have accumulated enough stuff to make flying harder - what's the best bet to get there?  We could fly, take a set of trains to Chamonix, or take a train from Barcelona to Geneva (I think) and rent a car there to make it easier to get around the Alps.",Family trip to Spain in August - assuming not the worst idea,itinerary,,1250jvd,,self.travel,1,1680034003,2023-03-28 20:06:43

travel,"Hey travelers,

I would like to get an advice. Sorry, if it gets a little bit longer.

I want/need to leave my country for a few month, because my wife needs to go to her homecountry and I decided to join. While the cause for the trip is not that pleasent (also not super duper bad) we plan to combine the trip with some fun stuff, visit some neigborhood countries and enjoy life for six month abroad.
It is relative short term and when I told my boss about it, he said directly that he will do everything to keep me at the company and enable me to do the trip anyway. I thanked him but also said that I will quit if we can't find a good compromise.

I should mention that I am lucky to work in a field where I can easily find a new job within days. So ""job security"" is not really an issue for me.

Today, HR offered me a contract that basically says, I can work in my current job, once I return after 6 month. I told the HR lady that I need to consider that and she was surprised that I was not super happy about it. I told her, I do not see many advantages in it. I'm not sure, what I exected.

Personally, I would prefer to be more flexible with my trip (e.g. return date). I also see the whole thing relative objectivly: There is an employee employer relationship and both sides need to agree if  we want to keep it going or not. If yes, great. If not, that's also fine.

So the thing is I was a bit shocked about the HR staffs reaction and asked in a work related subreddit for advice.  Everybody told me, I'm ungrateful and should be happy my employer makes me such an offer to go travelling without losing my job. I should be thankful, because other works do not have equal possibilities. And I wasted other peoples time by not taking the offer that they worked on providing me.  

That hit me harder than I would like to admit. I tend to doupt my decisions and worry a lot. Then I thought, it might also be because I asked in a sub, where work is relative high valued. So, I thought, I see what people who value travel think about the situation.

Maybe I should add, a few years back I quit a job for travelling as well and I met my wife during this trip. So I can say this was for sure the best decision of my life. The trip itself is not the issue. This will be our first months long travel since we met. We traveled here and there for a week or two but did not go on a longer trip for years. 

Would you take the freedom you get by quitting your job for travelling or would you prefer to stay employed but would be more limited concerning your trip?

They didn't even have it in their system when I tried to file a claim. It took a few follow ups and the bag was retrieved a few days later.

1. Elections are on 14th May. Will there still be protest tremors lingering around until July or will it be safe to travel?
2. I know earthquakes can’t be predicted/forecasted to the dot but I read some news around a potential earthquake hitting Istanbul soon as it sits on a fault line. How big of a threat this might be?

I can easily travel to Washington D.C. and rent a hotel with a single king / queen. Says the room ""sleeps 2"" I check in with my wife and kid at the desk, nobody says anything. I honestly didn't even really think it was something to consider until I was looking for a place in Denmark / France. And all the bookings were blocking me from grabbing a room with a single bed. Even ones with enough room for a travel crib if it was a requirement.

Some of the rooms do say ""no children"" - Assuming it's a noisy room or a wing with no kids - totally fine with that. What I'm talking about is rooms without restrictions listed, and it's as if the hotel is forcing me to up-charge to an XL room (which are all double the rate of a single typical hotel room we're used to booking).

travel,"Now I realize this is definitely a first world problem and I’m not “complaining” just commenting. But we’ve flown from the US mainland to Hawaii once or twice for the past 20 years. We are older and always fly first class (again, not complaining with this post, just commenting) and in lie flat since since they’ve become available on United. The airline ticket price increases are everywhere, but for these lie flat seats I always paid $2,100 +/- $300 each from 2017-early 2022. Since late 2022 I haven’t been able to find these same/comparable flights for under $4,600 each. This more than 100% increase seems to be a much greater % increase than most other flights I fly regularly. 

I’m wondering how long can these prices be sustained.

But as of today 11 of 14 seats in first are still available. I’m thinking people that used to buy these seats just aren’t willing to spend close to $10K for 2 tickets!

travel,"I recently got back from a two week vacation in Europe and overall I had a great time! It’s my first time traveling solo and would definitely do it again sometime soon. I just wanted to share some tips but moreso things I will do differently on my next one. 

1. For a two week trip, pack one week’s worth of clothing (if possible). If you’re staying at a metro city, you will find laundromats or if you’re staying at an Airbnb or something, you can probably have the option to use their washer/dryer. I don’t pack light since I always need options (cause fashion or whatever). 

2. Get an extra adapter (especially if you’re from the US traveling to Europe, etc). Mine broke on the first day and had to find one in Venice and the ones I found at first were €30+ but eventually stumbled upon one at a random store for €10. 

3. Schedule rest days. Jet lag wasn’t even the main issue but after week one I was getting sick and tired of going to museums and doing touristy stuff that I just wanted to do absolutely nothing. I wanted to see as many things as I can but I guess I forgot that I’m no machine.

4. Splurge on premium economy for longer flights if you can. I highly recommend it if you can afford it. I suffered during both of my flights (to and from the US) for 10 hrs and my seats were really uncomfortable even though I’m a tiny person. I wish I splurged a little for better seats so I can at least get some sleep during the flight. 

5. Bring my own to go box. Maybe this is stupid and weird but I know in some countries they don’t really have to go boxes like we do in the US, but as a solo traveler I can’t usually eat all of the food at once and need space for dessert. One bar in Paris eventually gave me a to go box when they saw that I still had a lot of food left when I asked for a check. I know I shouldn’t be embarrassed but it was embarrassing lol it would be nice to have my leftovers in my own to go box so I can munch on it later on. I think it’s a great way to not waste food especially if I can’t fit it all in my belly.


I’m not beating myself up for the mistakes I’ve done during my trip, after all, it’s not going to be my last one! Also, always bring a powerbank with you even if you have a phone that lasts an entire day, just cause you never know when you’ll need it!",Some things I’ll do differently on my next international trip,,,124pqa7,,self.travel,0,1680012102,2023-03-28 14:01:42

Would start by flying into Podgorica and going straight to Shkoder and spending a day there, doing the Valbone-Theth hike, then Tirana for a couple days. (Total about 6-7 days)

Option 2: 8 days

From Tirana head South and see Berat, Gjirokaster and Himare, before going to Sarande to get the ferry to Corfu on the last day for a flight back.

I am planning a solo trip to Italy.
Below are the cities I would like to visit:

Rome
Florence 
Bologna 
Venice

Milano

So I can start either from Milano or Rome, because flight tickets are the cheapest from my country to those 2 cities in Italy.

Anyway, I would really appreciate some tips and tricks from local people or travelers. 

I am low on budget, so I need information on: cheap accommodation in every city, what is the best way to get from one city to another(with website links where I can buy tickets), cheap food stores, public transportation in the city, free sightseeing and tours.

I have booked flights but my international flights are with two different airline companies. Karachi to Abu Dhabi and then from Abu Dhabi to Milan (with Etihad Airways) and from Milan to New York (with Air France).

My layover is just for 2 hours in Milan, but the problem is that I will have to retrieve my baggage and recheck it as the airline companies change. I have a valid US visa and I do not want to leave the airport and neither change terminals.

Though, to retrieve luggage, I may have to go through customs/immigration. Therefore, I want to ask if I would be requiring an airport transit visa for this? I have a valid US visa and I am a Pakistani national.

It is mentioned at schengen visa info that a person with a valid US visa is exempt from airport transit visa. How does retrieval of baggage and rechecking works at Milan Malpensa?

The worst case, will I be allowed to travel with just a hand carry? Therefore, I won't have recheck the baggage and I would directly head to the gate of my next flight.

I love the quality and feel of the Solgaard handle and wheels; however, I don’t get use out of the closet system and it’s physically smaller than the Away and Monos bags. I tried using my ex-boyfriend’s regular size Solgaard for a trip once, and ended up not using it because I couldn’t get everything to fit (my current larger carry on is a rolling duffle style, which is great, but I want one with 360 wheels).

Away has an expandable option, which sounds smart to me, even though not technically within specifications. Little undecided whether this feature is smart or dangerous. However, I read a couple things that suggested the Monos bags wheels and handle feel more durable than Away. But I know Away has done well in some reviews. 

Another difference is clamshell vs latch closure, but I haven’t settled on my preference there yet. 

In terms of the feel of rolling the suitcase, does anyone know whether the Away suitcase or the Monos suitcase is closer to the feel of Solgaard? I will be putting a very heavy backpack on top of it when i travel. 

I think my top priority is capacity, which knocks Solgaard out of the running, and my second priority is quality/feel, given my indecision on expandable and zipper vs latch. Given that, which would you recommend?

I'll be going with my girlfriend, we're both in our late 20s. We're both well-travelled and have solo travelled in the past, although unlike me my girlfriend has never been to a developing country, mainly just Europe and some developed Asian countries. She's from Korea so she's not used to seeing poverty, homeless, beggars and she's not really got any street smarts at all. I'm from the UK and I've spent time in some poorer counrries so a little more wise to the world.

If it was just me going I'd have no concerns about my safety but I'm worried about my girlfriend. I'll look out for her as best as I can but can't be on guard all the time and worrying she'll find it hard to turn down grifters or deal with persistent sellers etc. 

Also concerned about stories of sexual harassment towards women. Particularly since she's East Asian and so I think she'll attract a lot of attention from men since I don't think many East Asians go to India. She's quite nervous about it and I want to put her mind at ease.

I'm sure the vast majority of people there are lovely, as with anywhere, but wondering if the rep is truly warranted and if so, how we can do our best to keep safe and avoid problematic situations.",is India really that bad?,question,,124epl6,,self.travel,1,1679982262,2023-03-28 05:44:22

I am planning a trip for summer 2024 to celebrate my 30th birthday and I’m wondering if you had to choose, would you go to Japan for 2 weeks or go to Galapagos and do an 8 day cruise plus explore a bit of Ecuador?

One of my reasons for thinking about doing Galapagos was because of the constant impact climate change is having so I’d like to go before things potentially change in the environment or certain attractions become unavailable to tourists. I’d also potentially like to scuba dive one of the days while out there since I have my open water scuba certification. I’d love to see all of the nature and animals while I’m out there (especially swimming with hammerhead sharks, if possible!)

That being said, I do really love Japanese culture/ cuisine and Japan has always been on my bucket list. I’d love to go and see the nature side of Japan too (Mt Fuji, Nachi waterfall, etc). I have also heard that I may possibly need at least an advanced open water certification for Galapagos, so would need to get that this year.

I understand that budget is a big consideration here so I’d say $5k USD would be my budget for the trip (excluding flights). I’d wager that budget may go farther in Japan compared to Galapagos, but would love people’s input.

I am planning on traveling in Tunisia for about 3 weeks but week one I will be working in the evenings so really two weeks full off. Here is my tentative plan. I think the way I have, is too biased towards the coastal cities, am I missing out on some other places? Please let me know your thoughts.

April 15th - 18th - Tunis (Work in the evenings)

18th - 20th - Sidi Bou Said (Work in the evenings)

20th - Douz

21st-23rd Sahara camping tour (Vacation begins)

23rd (may extend to do some other adventure in Sahara like Quad bike)

24th explore star wars hotel and chott el djerid, evening in Tozeur

25th Stay in Tozeur (visit Chebika oasis etc)

26th - One night in Djerba (Rent a car here)

27th - One night in Sfax

28th - Drive to El Jem, spend a day (Night in Monastir/Soussee)

29th and 30th evening in Soussee

1st May - Kairoukuan  (visit Mosque, etc.)

2nd - Stay in Hammamet

3rd - 6th - Any suggestions? Maybe head back to Tunis and explore Cape Angela?

Also, 15-21 is overlapping with Ramadan time. Would finding places to eat and all be a bit difficult? Initially, I was thinking of renting a car from Djerba but it seems like going from Tunis to Douz is not straightforward. Is that the case? Would I need a 4\*4 car or would a normal compact car do?

At this time, we are planning to limit travel to England. This will be his first trip to Europe, my second. We are interested in history, natural beauty, food/cooking, art, and museums/culture. Seeing that we've never been to the UK, we'd like to hit a lot of the major tourist sites. We plan to use rail/bus travel for the majority of the trip. We'd like to limit our accommodations to 2-3 locations max; as we don't love packing and unpacking all the time. We are open to day trips from London or other locations, but we don't want to feel rushed. 

Here are the places that have intrigued us:

* London: will likely spend 1/3 – 1/2 of the trip here, possibly more
* Oxford or Cambridge
* Cotswolds
* York (likely going to get cut for logistics – it's so far north)
* Bath

I called Hawaiian and my wife and I explained my medical situation. I was told not to worry, the credits would be there, especially with COVID. When I started feeling myself again I called Hawaiian to reschedule a flight, but I was told I had to call a special number. I must have spent 20+ hours on hold. I tried different days, I never got anyone. I tried again after the first of this year, finally got through and was told no more refunds/credits were going to be given.

My girlfriend and I are spending a few weeks travelling by train around bits of France and Barcelona.

We've got a rough itinerary of things, like visiting the Luberon when we're in Avignon, Cassis from Aix, etc. We are mainly interested in places that don't feel manufactured and retain their culture rather than just catering to the appeal of the western tourist (like me) if that makes sense. Yes I know, tourists like me are why places feel touristy.

Hopefully that isn't too broad or too much of a ramble, but basically, what would you recommend that isn't common knowledge or just absolutely shouldn't be missed, or are there any events on during any of these periods?

travel,"Hello all!

My partner and I have been itching to do our first trip to Europe this fall, and have finally started to move forward with planning. In our 10 day itinerary, we are most interested in visiting Barcelona, Switzerland, and Munich. 

Just some brief points:

\- We are trying to aim for mid/end of September as we would like to attend Oktoberfest and meet up with one of my partner's German friends he met while in the U.S. 

\- Airfare budget \~$2,000 (US dollars)

\- Would like to spend approximately 3 days in each country. Not set on what other cities besides Munich and Barcelona (would love to catch a Barca match) we would like to visit/lodge in thus far, but very open.

While doing my initial research on flights, I found we would need multi-city flights (Home (New Orleans, LA, USA) --&gt; Barcelona; Barcelona --&gt; Switzerland; Train from Switzerland to Munich; Munich --&gt; Home). Ideally, this can be done in the reverse as well, as we are really trying to work within the time frame of Oktoberfest (Sept 16-Oct 3). However, booking in this order goes a bit over the ideal budget, as there are 3 separate flights and a train from Barcelona to Zurich, Switzerland would be way too long from my understanding. We are willing to X out Barcelona for a city in Italy (likely Milan), therefore we only have 2 separate flights and can take the train from Munich --&gt; Switzerland --&gt; Milan in a decent time frame, while staying within budget. We are absolutely set on Munich and Switzerland, but any other suggestions for a third nearby country would be great.

With that being said, my main questions are:

\- What would be the best way to go about booking multi-city flights and getting the best bang for our buck?

\- Is 10 days ideal for a first Europe trip?

\- Is it worth it to keep Barcelona on the itinerary? If not, what are some other cities you may suggest?

I'm still in the early phase of my research for this trip, but airfare is something we're looking to first book by next month.

travel,"It seems a common practice up to the 2000s to negotiate with the owner or upper manager for rates even in some chain brands. However these days even stand-alone non chain owned Inns arnt able or willing to negotiate to match online rates despite how they would prefer guests book through them than through the websites that take commission off them and that they still have plenty of rooms open. But their higher rates and reluctance to lower them make guests book-online for a lower rate. it due to contracts they have with these websites? Ie hotels, booking.com

I also noticed that the bargaining culture in Mexico or among Mexican vendors elsewhere seems to be gone as well in the last five years.

travel,"I recently received a $2,000 cash settlement from a car accident that’s free and clear for me to use as I want. I’m graduating from college in May and want to take a trip to cross something off my bucket list. I’m a 22M, pretty well traveled. I’ve narrowed it down to pretty much two options:

1) First-class flight to Hawaii. I found a screaming deal on a Hawaiian flight for $1,000 first class, round trip from the mainland. I’ve always wanted to fly first class at least once in my life. So, I could cross flying first class off my bucket list and get to go to Hawaii in the meantime. However, I’ve already been to Hawaii a few times in my childhood, so it’s not really a “new” destination for me. But then again, it’s Hawaii for crying out loud.

2) Alaskan cruise from Seattle. I’ve never been on a cruise, I’ve always wanted to go on one. Never been to Alaska either. I could fit a nice room on the ship and economy flights onto my $2,000 budget. The cruise itself would be somewhat between $1,000-1,500 depending on the dates. I’m a solo traveler, so it costs more than the $300-400 per person advertised fares out there.

Unfortunately, first class tickets into Seattle from my home city would cause me to exceed my budget by a large margin.

Any suggestions or any other “unique” travel opportunities for a solo traveler which may fit in my budget?

The main goal of the trip is surfing, we both shortboard and he has more experience than me, however, I definitely can hold my own in the lineup and in more powerful breaks. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for beaches for intermediate surfers? We're trying to stay away from rocky breaks or anything at river mouths so we can have some chill surf days, but we're also looking to get barreled a couple of times; we're flexible with our location and skill. During the whole trip, we are doing hostels and using a rental car across the country so I'm trying to aim for secluded beaches that aren't touristy. We are flying into San Jose and plan to go to Jaco for the first night to rest up after our red-eye flight, however, everything else is up in the air. I see all the beaches that are listed on travel websites, however, I know that's not the best way to truly see a country. 

Other than surfing we also want a true rainforest experience away from the craziness of tourists as well as check out great beaches for snorkeling and swimming. We're not looking to stay in resorts and have a luxury experience, just be very much be in nature and the environment. Please let me know if you have any recommendations for our trip at all!

travel,"As per the title, my partner and I are travelling to Istanbul during the first week in April. We travel a lot as a couple and usually spend our time in new cities just wandering around and trying the local cuisine and drinks. 

It’s a bit different this time as we’ve recently found out my partner is pregnant and subsequently her energy levels are a bit low and obviously we can’t go on our usual bar crawls! 

I’ve been looking up local English-speaking tour guides online who would be willing to show us the cultural-side of Istanbul, as well as some good places to eat and relax, but I feel like the prices we are being quoted seem a bit high. 

I absolutely respect someone giving us the benefit of their time and knowledge, but the average cost seems to be around £450 for 3hrs or £700 for 6hrs and whilst we have a decent enough budget available, I don’t want to be paying over the odds. 

Does anyone have any alternative recommendations or am I just being a bit tight here?",What should I be paying for a tour guide in Istanbul?,question,,123v3dq,,self.travel,1,1679940345,2023-03-27 18:05:45

But do I need to get stamped in/out only when I enter/exit the Schengen zone? Does Ireland complicate it at al? I also wonder because I will be flying into Spain, then flying from Spain to Switzerland, then taking a train to Munich, do I have to get stamped into and out of Switzerland, then back into Germany?

travel,"So. Like it says. 

I'm currently a teacher but I have decided that teaching is no longer for me. I haven't travelles much as a teacher because even though I have the summer off, a) I don't make a lot of money so I usually worked a second job in the summer and b) I didn't want to travel to certain places in the summer because it would be too hot or too busy. 

I'd like to find a job where I can work a bunch over a shorter period of time (like a month or two) and make a good amount of money and then have a month off and then repeat. 

In an ideal world, I would be a freelance writer, but I think it's pretty unrealistic for me to be able to make enough money to travel, at least for awhile. 

I don't want to work this way forever but I'm 34 and still single &amp; childless so I figured I might as well travel as much as I can now. I'd like to have kids and the clock is ticking so if I meet the right person I wouldn't want to wait very long to have kids with them.

I have a Bachelor of Arts in English and a Bachelor of Education. I'd rather not have to go back to school if I don't have to since I don't necessarily want this to be a forever thing but I would consider it.

My dad is a pilot and his schedule was a month on/a month off for years, which would be fine while I don't have kids but when I did have kids it would suck. 

Any ideas??? Does such a job exist?? I'm not sure what sort of fields support freelance work.

Hello everyone!

Firstly, I am a Work&amp;Travel students from Turkey, and I am going to stay in USA throughout the summer. After the program ends, I have a chance to travel and wander around Boston, New York and Washington.

And the last thing is that my trip will probably end in Washington, but I want to see Miami! I don't know whether it makes sense to go to Miami with a car because I have 15-20 days to travel the USA.

travel,"Hello fellow redditors,

I'm planning a trip in late September from the UK to the US because my partner and I want to visit some National Parks and the Grand Canyon. We don't really care about the cities themselves as we're more interested in landscapes.

The itinerary would more or less be:

 Day 1: San Francisco
 Day 2: Drive to Yosemite
 Day 3: Yosemite
 Day 4: Drive to King's Canyon
 Day 5: Sequoia Park
 Day 6: Death Valley
 Day 7: Drive to Grand Canyon
 Day 8: Grand Canyon
 Day 9: Las Vegas (Red Rock Canyon)
 Day 10: Go back to sunny UK
 

I know it's a lot of driving but we're used to very busy holidays and we enjoy it. I'm wondering if it would be wise to remove Kings Canyon for example and put that extra day somewhere else. We could also expand the trip to make it 14 days but I'm afraid budget-wise it would get too demanding.



Any kind of advice or tip would be appreciated. Thanks a lot!","Planning this trip to California National Parks and Grand Canyon, anything I should definitely do/not do?",question,,123qfm9,,self.travel,1,1679931059,2023-03-27 15:30:59

travel,"I received an email today detailing the changes. **TLDR, they downgrade the reward program discount from 10% to 2%.**

Previously you got a stamp with 10% of the value of the night for each night, and when you had 10 stamps you could use the average value of the 10 stamps for a new booking, effectively a 10% discount. 

Now you just earn 2% right away without having to save 10 stamps.

https://www.hotels.com/one-key

While I'm slightly pissed about this and think it will be slightly counterproductive (as the 10% discount was enough to keep me on Hotels.com, the poor 2% discount means I'll now just go wherever is cheapest), at least it seems like the transition to the new system will be fair, and you'll get your full stamps value in ""OneKeyCash"".

travel," 

Hi everyone,

I'm new to travelling and I have a question about my upcoming flights. I'm flying from New Delhi to Prince George in Canada with a layover in Frankfurt and Vancouver. My flight from New Delhi to Frankfurt lands at 8:30am, and my connecting flight from Vancouver to Prince George departs at 5:40pm. I booked the flights separately, with Lufthansa for the first leg and WestJet for the second leg.

My main concern is whether the layover time in Vancouver is enough for the domestic flight to Prince George. I've never travelled to Canada before and I'm not sure what to expect. Will I need to collect my baggage and go through customs again in Vancouver, or will it be checked through to Prince George? And how long does it usually take to go through customs and security for a domestic flight?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",Layover time in Vancouver: Is it enough for a domestic flight to Prince George?,question,,123o8b6,,self.travel,1,1679926751,2023-03-27 14:19:11

travel,"I have a couple of big milestones coming up (40th bday this Spring and 15th sobriety birthday next Summer). My husband &amp; I are going to take celebration trips for both, but I am overwhelmed looking at options and am seeking input here. We travel domestically quite a bit,  always with our kids. We have also travelled a decent amount without our kids in the Caribbean (eastern side of Mexico, Bahamas, DR, Jamaica, Cayman Islands), but we are worried about the amount of sargassum headed that way this summer and so are looking at other possibilities. I have been to France and England, he has been to Greece, Turkey, and Northern Italy. We are wanting to use at least one of these trips to go to a new place together than neither of us has previously been to. Since we have travelled almost exclusively in the Caribbean, I have no ideas what else is out there that might work for us! Some info below about each trip to hopefully help in gaining suggestions from you all:

40th bday trip:
- would be this summer, likely in mid to late June
- kid free trip! I want to relax and read a book without interruptions every five minutes
- max of 8 days so not looking at anything that that takes 12+ hours to get there from Indy/Chicago area or requires more than one connection 
- we are warm weather people, so not interested in any cold weather locales 
- I am a beach person. My husband will tolerate beaches as long as there is a decent amount of activities. He also enjoys local beers and foods. I am not an adventurous eater so would need “Americanized” options
- budget for this trip is $6k max for hotel/flight/food. Can go above that for anything extra. 

15th sobriety bday trip:
- max of 12-14 days
- could go anytime from Memorial Day to Labor Day next summer 
- could either take kids (would be 3 and 8 at the time), or could do another solo trip
- my dream vacation is Maldives, my husbands dream vacation is a tour of all MLB stadiums. I like quiet, he likes to stay busy. So would need some combo of both. 
- no specific budget, within reason

All suggestions welcome! Thank you",Help me decide on vacation spot,question,,123lieq,,self.travel,0,1679919985,2023-03-27 12:26:25
travel,"This is just a rant. Just traveled on a DOH- USA flight in business class with Qsuites. I booked the ticket using a partner awards program and I was really excited with all the hype around qatar airways on social media. Although I am really appreciative of the roomy cubicle and the great bedding in Qsuites, I didn’t find the whole experience living up to the hype of being the world’s best business  class mostly due to the service. The service was more comparable to US airlines than Asian airlines. For one there wasn’t any personalized service that usually comes with traveling in premium cabins such as being addressed by name or remembering your meal preference. I had to remind them of my meal preferences during the meal service and the crew seemed to be in a hurry to finish up the meal service. The bread that they served in both meals was either too hard to eat or crumbled just on breaking it.  Food presentation wasn’t that great either (they did have a fake lamp though that added a nice touch).  The seats looked old and worn. Restrooms weren’t constantly  cleaned during the flight. The onboard movie collection wasn’t too extensive. I wonder if covid had to do something with the state that Qatar airways is in now.  Of course it’s totally possible that it was a one off thing and maybe I didn’t get their best. I have seen far better service and food in Japan airlines although their hard product are not the most popular. Things that did go well - checkin and boarding in Doha was really smooth and their lounges are awesome in Doha. Their amenity kit is good and pyjamas are comfy.",Qatar airways business class is overrated IMO.,,,123l9oc,,self.travel,0,1679919343,2023-03-27 12:15:43

travel,"Whilst I understand Italians might be seen as multi-millionaires travelling to Tunisia, I wish locals would understand that the constant harassment will only make tourists (whether they're Italians or not) not wanting to come back. 

Felt like an actual walking target, from the moment I went downstairs to the hotel lobby to the walks around different cities. 

\- street vendors constantly trying to speak/say something in Italian to you, whilst switching back to MSA as soon as you say no or ignore them 

\- not understanding that a no is a no, If I'm not interested in what you're trying to sell to me, please understand that and let me go 

\- a couple of people literally took money away from my dad's hands and grabbed my brother's arm as they didn't want him to leave

\- massive arguments when we bought a small souvenir from one seller instead of another one, up to the point that we had to leave immediately and jump back onto our car 

\- people randomly approaching you inside the medina trying to walk you somewhere even though you still want to enjoy your walk inside the area, then asking for money without understanding when to stop. 

On the other side, I met some amazing people, and I really appreciate the fact that some of them have literally nothing yet they're still extremely happy with their life. We drove past what it looked like an actual war zone outside Tunis, and our local guide/driver had a smile on his face, he was saying hi to everyone left and right and from my brief conversation I tried to have with him in English, he said he was happy with what he had and didn't need more. He had his car, his animals, and some income from driving tourists around.

So I made an itinerary already, planning to visit a few famous hawkers, bars, and restaurants, and a few tourist spots too (Bugis, Chinatown, Orchard, Marina Bay mostly). Will most restaurants and tourist spots be closed on these holidays? For example, I plan to explore Chinatown and some hawkers in the area on the 5th, but my common sense tells me that most of the food stalls will be closed since people will go praying? Is this usually the case? Should I move it to the 6th let's say?

And also, would you guys recommend reserving spots at restaurants or rooftop bars in advance since it will be more crowded? Another question would be what will the weather be during this time? I know that it rains quite often all year long over there, but hoping for more sun when I visit lol.

travel,"Going to a destination wedding in Sintra with my partner and will have 2.5 days in Lisbon to explore (I have been before, my partner has not). We decided we wanted to go to Porto afterward and already booked our flight (which was significantly cheaper than flights from Lisbon to our home city) but realizing that our time in porto will be pretty quick, since we’ll be traveling the morning after the wedding (obviously not too early) and the train takes 3-4 hours. We’ll have a half day (if you can call it that), a full day, and another half day before our evening flight. 

We are stuck with the flight (which, even if we just take the train to Porto the day of our flight home, is still hundreds of $ cheaper than flying from Lisbon) so wondering if the ~2 days are worth it in porto?

The Beis 21-inch Carry-On luggage external size on their site states that it is:  W 40cm H 58cm D 25cm / W 15.78in H 22.8in D 9.8in

The Monos states spec size on their site states that it is:  H22"" × W14"" × D9"" / H55.9cm x W35.6cm x D22.8cm

It's my understanding that the general recognized industry standard for carry on luggage is 22"" × 14"" × 9"" (in line with the Monos).

However, I do fly Air Canada very often and their sizing is much different being: H21.5in x W15.5in xD9in / H55cm x W40cm x D23cm. 

I've rarely seen Air Canada care about the 0.5 inch difference in height but they do care about the other measurements. 

So I would go with the Monos but since Air Canada does give a more room for the width, I do wish the Monos was slightly bigger (given that I am an over-packer).

What would you recommend? I am also interested to hear if there's any other brands that have the same sleek style &amp; quality in the same or lower price point.

First option is with United, taking a 15 hour flight to Washington, then a 4 hour layover, then a 3 hour flight to my destination. This would be in economy for about 45k miles.

Second option is with American, or in this case via Qatar Airways. First it’s a 10 hour flight to Qatar, a 10 hour layover, a 15 hour flight to Atlanta, a 15 hour layover, then a 2 hour flight to my destination. This would be in first class all the way for about 75k miles.

I’ve flown first class only once before, on a 7 hour flight. Never have I been so refreshed coming off a flight. I’ve also flown 12 hours in economy before, and it was basically the opposite experience.

The difference in miles and cost isn’t huge, so ignore that aspect. If you could choose one journey, what would it be? Economy in 22 hours or First Class (with lay flat seats) in 52 hours?

travel,"I am a 29 y/o female with 2 kids under 10. I basically need some guidance on how to get off the grid and just start over in a brand new life where no one knows my kids or I. 

For context, I'm doing this simply because my it feels like my biological family hates me. They constantly call me dramatic, and as I have gotten older it seems like more and more people seem to drop away or want no contact. Alot of it is with out differences in religion. I live in the midwest, right in the dead heart of the Bible belt, and all want to genuinely not talk to me because I won't forgive my parents for sexually assaulting me as a child and went through severe abuse. That being said I testified against my dad and he went to jail, and my mom was never fully held accountable. (their mindset is- regardless of the offense if God forgave you have to forgive.) And I'm just not there, nor do I think I ever will be.

I'm actively in therapy and I'm taking meds, basically just trying to move forward in life, but I feel like I am haunted by where I live with all these memories so I need out. So I am looking for advice about not only how to get off grid, but where are the best places to do so in the Pacific Northwest.

People don't understand the religious cult mafia type behaviors that are in some of these churches, and it sucks feeling like you are completely alone in the world.

travel,"Hello.

Me and a few of my friends from Sweden are planning a 2 week trip to Vietnam in Jan/Feb where we are considering renting mopeds (or something along those lines). I have some general thoughts and questions about this. We are all male in our early 20s, we all have traveling experience, but most of our previous trips have been with family and with very simple accommodation (hotel or renting villas), mostly in Europe too.

We want to rent mopeds and kind of experience Vietnam on the fly, obviously planning stops and such beforehand (not booking hotel/homestay rooms thought). Is it maybe better to actually book the places where we should sleep beforehand?

The thought we have in mind is to travel from Da Nang all the way down to Ho Chi-Minh City, but is it even possible to do this with mopeds?

 Is it maybe better to rent cars just incase? By doing in on mopeds we'd probably get to remote places a little easier.

Would it even be possible to rent a vehicle/mopeds in Da Nang and bring them to Ho Chi-Minh City (or nearby)? 

We'd stop and sleep every night in new places, is that something we can rely on, that we'll always have a place to sleep?

We'll drive mostly on the coastal roads, avoiding big city centers because of the traffic, and hopefully leave the mopeds a bit from Ho Chi-Minh City and maybe take a taxi in when we are to leave?

Another thought we've had is if it's better to go by train or bus to different towns/cities, but would it still be possible to sightsee the same amount?

There are probably a bunch of things I've yet thought about, I'd appreciate any info and advice I can get. Is it better to maybe do this in a different country instead? (preferably Asia)

I will be in Madrid for approx. 4 days, from 6-10 April. I have a few things in my mind that I'd like to do, and I wonder if anyone can give me some insight regarding travel tickets/events and such.

Out of the 4 days I will most likely spend Sunday and Monday in Madrid itself, just walking around, mainstream sights and the likes (flight outbound is on Tuesday at 6am) I am considering going to a bullfight, although I am not sure how it is perceived in Spain at the moment. I found a place that sells combo tickets for a city tour + bullfight on Sundays, but I don't know if that's the best available option.

For the first 2 days, my plan is to visit a couple nearby cities like Toledo or Segovia, possibly both (or if you have a better recommendation, I am open to suggestions) My main question is, what would be the best ticket option for me? Should I just buy day passes for when I am in Madrid and the return train/bus for the other cities, or is there a better option than that? I am also wondering whether there would be any events in Madrid or nearby at that time that I should not miss (mainstream or ""hidden gems"" just as much)",Visiting Madrid for 4ish days.

I have seen that it seems to depend from airline to airline, and usually a fee is involved, maybe around 100-300 USD depending on time of year etc, which is fine.

travel,"Hi! Me and my husband are thinking of having kids in a few years, so we are really trying to prioritise travelling before then. We are based in the UK, so while generally Europe is cheap and accessible to us, where we live we don't have particularly great airports nearby.

Vienna and Budapest have been on our list of places to want to visit for a while but they are a bit of a pain to get to from our local airport. Ideally we would fly into one and out of another but that's proving tricky. It would require travelling to an airport about 5-6 hours away and the way the flight times work out, that would involve probably taking at least one extra day annual leave from work to factor in that travel. We are trying to maximise the amount of travel we can do with our annual leave allowance, so ideally don't want to waste a day or two on travelling to an airport.

Bratislava is a destination that's super cheap to fly out of our local airport and as it's located kinda between these Vienna and Budapest, I'm thinking of a trip that would look something like this:

Day 1:
Arrive in Bratislava around 10am, train or bus to Budapest.

Day 2-3:
Budapest

Day 4: 
Train or bus to Vienna from Budapest. 

Day 5-7:
Vienna

Day 7:
Early bus/train to Bratislava, spend the day there 

Day 8:
Flight home from Bratislava at 7am

travel,"Hey travelers!

I have plans to to Hong Kong in April and then Canada in May this year. However, I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with.

Firstly, what are some good airlines to consider for a round trip from the Philippines to Hong Kong? I'm looking for recommendations based on comfort, affordability, and overall experience.

Secondly, I'm a bit concerned about flying from Hong Kong and if doing so will have any affect on my flight to Canada in some way due to some of the COVID regulations. Are there any that I should be aware of, and how can I prepare for them?

Finally, I'm also looking into connecting flights from the Philippines to Vancouver Canada. Are they ideal, and what are the best airlines to consider based on your experience?

please let me know if my Osaka-Nara-Kyoto itinerary makes sense, esp. when it comes to using the correct pass and lumping together of sites to visit? I'm also not quite confident yet if I completely understood the uses of their different passes 😅

Days 2 to 3-- sightseeing in Osaka using Osaka Amazing Pass

             leave luggages at Nara stn 
             from Nara, head to Kyoto using JR West Kansai Pass

Day 5 -- Fushimi Inari Shrine / Higashiyama/ Kiyumizu-dera / Gion/Pontocho Alley

Day 6 -- Arashiyama / Kinkaku-ji temple / Nishiki Market

Day 7 -- last day in Kyoto

head back to KIX Airport using JR West Kansai pass.

I did check the JR West Kansai website to see if they do have lines to go through Nara-Kyoto-KIX airport...

travel,"I was recently lucky enough to listen to Robert Reynolds share his story.  Re-creating scenes and landscapes wasn't only a profession, but it was something at the very centre of his identity.  So you can only imagine the sense of turmoil and disruption which ensued when Robert suffered a rare form of stroke that would leave him totally blind in his left eye and subsequently rob him of the ability to paint.

Robert's approach to life since this life changing event is that he wants to spend the rest of his life maximising on vision and to do this, he has chosen to bicycle tour.

Bicycle Touring was something Robert has enjoyed doing for many decades - even prior to his life changing stroke.  But since this event, he has been inspired to spend the best part of 6 - 8 months of each year exploring the world on his two wheels.  In his own words - he needed to do something harder than being blind whilst seeing as much as possible.  He is now more comfortable out enjoying the outdoors and sleeping in his tent. 

Robert has toured extensively throughout the world, including North and South America, South East Asia, Europe and Africa.  I personally found inspiration listening to him recount his experiences from his cycle tours and interactions with people in different countries and cultures. 

The images below are a small collection from Robert of his cycle tours and also a couple of his art sketches.  You can hear him share his story on the Seek Travel Ride podcast.  It really gave me a sense of wanderlust and the idea of 'maximising my vision' and seeing the world at a slower pace really resonates.

travel,"Travelling is my passion and I've been fortunate to visit every continent except Europe. Next year, I'm planning to take a 3 months off with my S.O. to finally do Europe but I feel like I'm starting to seriously question the way I travel. Let me explain why. 

My travel itineraries have always been very well planned. Say I wanted to go to Tokyo. 
* First I'll search on Reddit, TripAdvisor, YouTube and Google Reviews to identify the best things to do. These would include major attractions (e.g. Shibuya Crossing) but also hidden gems (e.g. a hiking day trip to Kamakura).
* Then I'll research a good value accommodation to stay at that allows me easy access to all these places. 
* Next I'll research the best restaurants to eat at near the things I want to do. I usually watch food vloggers or search local review sites for recommendations since Google/TripAdvisor reviews are always skewed towards tourists and I prefer places that are popular with the locals. 
* Finally I'll use all of this to plan a meticulous itinerary that allows me to get to everywhere I need to be, account for travel time (with buffer) and reduce any inefficiencies from needing to backtrack. Typically I only have 1-2 things I definitely want to tick off for the day so it's definitely not jam packed like a lot of packaged tours are. 

The benefit of this approach is that I'm able to craft a very efficient itinerary that allows me to tick off the best things to do/eat in an area while optimized for the time I have. I also save money because I'll be booking bang-for-buck accommodation (which usually sells out early) and I reduce backtracking. I also reduce the amount of planning I need to when I'm travelling so I can enjoy things in the moment. 

The unfortunate downside is that I rarely get to discover things on my own. While I'm not on a tight schedule, there's still a timeline to follow so I never get the chance to just do something completely random. I do have portions of my itinerary that allow for discovery (e.g. spend the afternoon exploring a particular district with no other plans for the day) but I rarely discover anything new. I'm also starting to find that that after doing so much planning, I never feel completely satisfied when I finally see that museum I read so much about or go to that beach with a 4.8 star Google rating with 10k+ reviews. Maybe because I already know what to expect so it takes the fun out of discovering something for the first time. This is why I've recently stopped reading too much about a particular attraction other than knowing it has good reviews, but then I lose the context and why I should be seeing it in the first place so I appreciate it less. While I feel like I can over plan sometimes, I also don't completely regret doing my research either because there have been some really good restaurants, hotels and hidden gems that I would not have known about if I didn't discover them before the trip.

I guess I'm now at a point where I want to experience the joys of discovering things for myself but also want to make sure I don't miss out on the really good experiences due to not planning enough. 

Back to my future Europe trip, the old me would've come up with an itinerary that has me going through a new country every 1-2 weeks. Maybe something like [this](https://www.eurail.com/en/get-inspired/suggested-itineraries/european-highlights-itinerary). Every country will have it's own itinerary based on our interests with accommodation and transport booked well in advance to save on costs. But I'm wondering if I should plan less and just work it out when I'm there. Is it possible to do this in Europe? I'm thinking of going from March to June so it will be before it gets too busy. How could I go about this new way of travel? I have so many questions like:
* How far in advance will I need to plan? Say I was I started in Rome, how do I know how long to book my accommodation? If I wanted to go to Florence next, when should I book my accommodation and how would I know how long I need to book for? 
* If I don't plan anything beforehand, how would I know where to go next? My S.O. and I won't be meeting new people much so we'll probably be looking things up online. Given we're going to be getting ideas online anyways, isn't it more efficient to do it before we go travelling so we can focus our holiday on enjoying the country we're in rather than planning? 
* One idea I heard was to book accommodation but ensure they have free cancellation. That way you can be flexible and change your trip itinerary when you learn about new things. I feel like if I did this, I might end up sticking to the accommodation I had pre-booked because there was a reason I wanted to go to those places in the first place. How can I learn about new things to do that I won't necessarily know about from doing research on Reddit, Google or TripAdvisor?

Keen to hear if others have had similar experiences on trying to not over plan and how you've dealt with this. And for those that have always travelled with minimal plans, how you manage to be comfortable with knowing you might not see everything and saving on costs.",Mid life travel crisis: how to balance planning with discovery?,question,,1229bbu,,self.travel,0,1679800345,2023-03-26 03:12:25

travel,"Hey all,

I'm beginning to plan my vacation this year and have decided on a European solo trip. I'm leaning towards UK (splitting time between the various countries if the time allotment makes sense) or Germany just because I know about the rich history each offers, but am more than willing to hear about alternatives. 

I guess as an American I'm partial to those two because we learn and see so much about them right from childhood, but I of course know other European countries probably have amazing history that I'm just unaware of, so I'm willing to be convinced!

General details:

- 31 year old American male
- I want to spend about 2 weeks on the ground, but will give myself about 16 or 17 days total to account for travel time
- In any new area, my top interests are:
    - history (monuments, castles, religious shrines, museums, etc)
    - food
    - sightseeing (outdoor experiences)
    - ""excursions"" when available (catamaran ride to a waterfall or ATV riding type experiences)
    - I don't care much about beaches or water activities, but I'll hit them if available
- I want to feel safe and be able to explore and walk around freely - not being confined to a resort
- Money isn't a great concern, but if one place is currently 2x more expensive than other places due to currently global financial conditions, I'd take that under consideration

Two friends and I spent 2 weeks in Thailand last year, split between Bangkok and Chiang Mai and it was AMAZING. Was my first true international trip (had a previous vacation to Jamaica, but 80% of it was at the resort, and the other 20% was guided excursions and tours). In Thailand we felt safe enough to just explore freely, walk and travel wherever we wanted, eat at local food spots where we couldn't even understand the menu, etc. I thought the culture shock would've hit me but it didn't at all. Best of all, we went during ""monsoon"" season so the tourist levels were massively down. Almost felt like having the cities to yourself (and it barely even rained anyway).

This makes me think I want that same ""totally different culture"" type trip this year, which would be an argument against a place like UK. But I don't want to get stuck in one type of travel experience, and I've always wanted to visit the UK anyway, so not ruling them out.

Appreciate anyone who gets through such a long post, and please let me know if you need any other info to help make relevant suggestions!",UK vs Germany for two weeks solo travel trip (but open to other suggestions),,,1221a5x,,self.travel,2,1679782790,2023-03-25 22:19:50

travel,"Hi all,

Right to the details.

Who: married couple with a 2.5 year old + 3 month old (will be at time of travel)

When: Early Sept to early Oct (can shorten or lengthen based on cost)

What: Road trip vs flight vs train. Either drive to the location with frequent stops. Or fly there, and then when there use public transit/trains to go between locations. Car easier to lug stuff, but parking in any big city sucks. 

Where: This is the big question mark. We've debated getting a place in Chicago (we're outside the city) but we are there all the time. Summer time Chicago is amazing though. Or an east coast trip [Boston, NYC, Philly]. We've even debated Paris for 3 weeks, but have apprehension about international travel with an infant for health risks. Anywhere is open I guess, if it fits:

Budget: All in I'd like to spend less than 8k. (Includes flight, rental car if needed, airbnb, logistics - not food/drink/experience)

Wants: Central location- would love to walk to coffee, park (walking trail + a few kids playgrounds), great restaurants. Public transit decent system. (Bonus if there's a rooftop I can chill on, gym attached/near by, or a beach near by)

Give me some suggestions. As a note, we've traveled to 25+ countries, and 6 with our toddler. I'm not sure being in one location for 3-4 weeks would be that exciting (outside of somewhere like Paris where we could day trip all over), so probably best to have a few different places/locations.",Travel 3 to 4 weeks (with toddler + infant) help,question,,121w8yn,,self.travel,0,1679772188,2023-03-25 19:23:08

I'm looking for summer vacations suggestions (end of June/beginning of July). We're a family of 3, and our daughter will be 1yo by that time. 

We don't use any baby carriage, only a baby carrier, a Marsupial (don't exactly know the English term) and we like:
- nature (hiking, etc);
- beach;
- cities with a good cultural identity (typical foods, vibrant life, etc), which somehow excludes those tourists resorts or cities that have mass tourism). So basically, we like the 'off beaten tracks'. 

We're from Portugal and locations 'close' to us that check these boxes are basically Mediterranean destinations:
- Greece. Con: travelling from islands to islands can be very tiring for a baby 
- Balcans (Croatia, Slovenia, Albania, etc)
- Sardinia. Con: a bit expensive
- Sicily. Con: Big island with the main attractions being far from each other
- Cyprus
- Malta 

And many more that are good candidates for us.
From all of these that I mentioned, Malta is increasingly gaining our attention. Is small, beautiful beaches and nature, historical cities, the north is countryside and relatively cheap. 

Any other suggestions that are escaping us? Or some opinions of the places mentioned?
