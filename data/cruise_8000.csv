Cruise,My bf and I (from the united states) are going on a cruise this summer that will be leaving from Rome. We already booked it but because we were booking it while being in the US it gave us problems and was saying we have to have a primary guest who is 21 or older even though on the website it states that any cruise leaving from Europe the primary guest must be 18 so we had to call royal caribbean and the employee booked our cruise for us. I wanted to make sure ahead of time that we will not have any issues getting on the ship once we get there since we are only 18.

Cruise,"Me (M46), the wifey (F46) and the kids (M18/F16) returned from what was a lovely cruise on the Carnival Horizon.  Ports of call were Aruba, Bonaire, La Romana (DR) and Amber Cover (DR).  We went on excursions at every port.  The kids has their own room across the hall.  Wifey and I did the Capitan's Table dinner on Day 2 and the La Romana excursions without the kids.  There were tons of people coughing everywhere on and off the ship.  Thankfully, we are all vaccinated and boosted. Pfizer and Moderna mix for me.

I started to feel soreness in the throat on Friday (Day 7 - Amber Cove) and fell into full blown sickness (akin to a really bad Flu) on the following Tuesday.  I took a home test and a PCR test which both came back negative,  By Wednesday I started to feel better and was back to normal on Thursday with a little cough and fine today (Friday).  I thank my vaccinations for making my COVID journey fast and relatively easy.  

The strange thing is that my wife got sick but HAS NEVER tested positive. She took the same home and PCR test as me, on the same day and they both came back negative.  I cannot rationalize this.  Her sickness followed mine by one day.  Her symptoms are very similar to mine but she is having a slightly worse time than me (two days really sick).  She's starting to feel better now.

I'm a 22M travelling solo and I really want a balcony room. All prices are for balcony. I've been going very in-depth on different options, but I'm not sure which option here is better to cruise to Alaska:

&amp;#x200B;

1. NCL Spirit - Leave Vancouver - Skagway/Hubbard Glacier (No Glacier Bay)- End in Seward (7 Days Total) - $1,085 out the door.
2. NCL Jewel - Leave Vancouver - Skagway/Hubbard Glacier/AND Glacier Bay - End in Seward (7 Days Total) - $1,690 out the door.
3. Sapphire Princess - Round Trip Vancouver - Includes Glacier Bay and a few towns - 7 Days total - $1,443 out the door (mini-suite available for $1,690).
4. Holland Westerdam - Roundtrip Seattle - Stevens Passage/Hubbard Glacier (No Glacier Bay)- 7 Days total - $1,620 out the door.
5. Crown Princess - Roundtrip Vancouver - Icy Straight/Hubbard Glacier (No Glacier Bay) - 11 Days Total - $1,656 out the door.

I'm sort of leaning towards Princess or NCL but I'm uncertain what I want to do. I'm really not big on the whole formal thing and I really like NCL's flexible dining/flexible kind of ""do what you want"", but all the reviews and thing I'm reading online is that Princess is usually a better experience?

Cruise,"So my family and I (2 parents, 1 older brother, and myself) are going on the Holland Cruises to Alaska mid-late May of this year. I booked an Oceanview for the 4 of us for $2700 on Holland Cruises but now I'm not sure if I should have shelled out an additional $1500 for a Balcony on Princess Cruises. My parents are in their mid to late 50s and my brother is in his early 30s while I'm in my mid twenties. This is my family's first time taking a cruise and we wanted to go see Alaska in the summer. 

I heard Princess cruises has more of a younger crowd than Holland Cruises but is that true? Should it influence my decision that much?

Also is the additional $1500 for Balcony worth it? $2700 for 4 ppl for an Oceanview seems like a steal to me but my family has always been financially conservative and that $1500 could go towards plane tickets in my mind. We won't be going with any kids.

We don‚Äôt know our check-in time yet (still months away). We hope there will be enough time between checkin, lunch, spa.

Cruise,"On my bucket list is a world cruise.  (This obviously won't happen until both my wife and I retire.)  My goto cruise has always been the [Oceania 180+ day world cruise](https://www.oceaniacruises.com/2025-around-the-world-cruise).  For me, one of the factors was the presence of inside staterooms which would save us some money.  (We're less interested in the ship's facilities and far more interested in the number of ports, etc.)  Some years the route they take goes far off the beaten path, which makes it even more interesting for me.

I've never been all that interested in the quick round the world cruises that are about four months long.  And Viking's world cruise with balcony rooms as the minimum just seemed too expensive.  So the Oceania cruise hits my sweet spot.

So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the announcement of [Royal Caribbean's 274 day cruise](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/ultimate-world-cruise/).  On a per day basis, it seems to be cheaper than Oceania's.  (Yes, the food and inclusions won't be as good.  But it's even more ports, etc.)  But this is the first time they're offering such a cruise, and they may not due it once we've retired.

But I've seen some stories about some extended (longer than a year) world cruises that don't seem that expensive.  They spend more time in port, and less time at sea.  This means more time to explore.  But when I try to find out more about them, my Google skills fail me.  From what I can tell, these cruises are longer than the ones above, but shorter than the [Storyline ship](https://www.storylines.com/) which basically is designed around you owning a condo on board.

Me and 3 others (young 20s) are planning on going on a cruise in September (dates 9-17 specifically). We‚Äôre deciding between 2 cruises.

Harmony of the Seas and MSC Seascape.

We‚Äôve obviously done research and Harmony of the Seas is the superior ship in general (lots more to do!) but we‚Äôre also first time cruisers and don‚Äôt really know what we‚Äôre missing out on.

I recently looked into MSC, and it is a LOT cheaper around the dates we‚Äôre looking at. Again, it‚Äôs a way different ship, but it‚Äôs a lot cheaper and it‚Äôs going to ports (Cozumel, Ocho R√≠os, Ocean Cay, and The Cayman Islands) we find much more intriguing than the Royal selection (Basseterre St Kitts, Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas, and Coco Cay).

Essentially, it‚Äôs better ship and reputation versus intriguing ports and cheaper price. What would you guys recommend for a first time cruiser? Are the ports for MSC really better than the Royal ports?

Cruise,"Not sure if this is allowed but I had to share my experience somewhere so anyone looking to do this cruise at least has some insight.

**Context:** I've taken a few cruises in the last 6 years. I'm not a cruise expert in the least sense but I'm familiar with what to expect. This one was for a bachelor party of a group of seven for a 5-day cruise out of Miami. In total, it was roughly $2000 for me and my friend to split a basic cabin together. Given the fact that we were expecting tons more out of a no-kids cruise, we were pretty disappointed, but there were great aspects of it as well.

**Aesthetics:** For the most part, the cruise was clean and very stylish and trendy. They designed all the bars and restaurant to really feel different from each other and still maintain a sense of luxury. The rooms are really cool, and they come with a tablet to control the TV, the air, and the lights. It also comes with presets to change the lights for meditation, sleep, and even one for sex. The bathrooms were tight but despite its size, the shower inside might be one of the best showers I've ever used on a cruise - let alone on vacation. Very soothing. They had some exclusive cabanas on the deck to rent, which looked cool to do if I came with my wife.

**Food:** Literally the best thing about the cruise. It was definitely a plus that all restaurants were free to dine at, with the exception of premium menu items but that didn't bother me one bit. Best ones were the Experimental Kitchen (Gastro) and Gunnbae (Korean BBQ). Although the general cafeteria was sit-down and time-consuming to wait for food, everything tasted beyond my expectations. A big plus for quick eats were the pizza cafe and the hot-dog bar next to the arcade/game room. Didn't get to try the ice cream bar but saw a lot of people eating them. Overall, if you hate cruise food, this one will definitely blow your mind.

**Drinks:**  Service was fast and great, but nothing really stood out in terms of quality. What's cool is that every restaurant/lounge had a few exclusive drinks, and while some were hit or miss, nothing stood out to me as a must-have. Also there is no drink package available. You can buy a bar tab and they'll gift you a free $100, but there's not much way to ""save"" money when you drink - although they're reasonably priced. What is a huge plus was that they had drink stations at the cafeteria where you could get water, juice, or soda 24/7. They also had some unique cafes with premium coffee but you had to pay for those. 

**Activities:** The biggest let down of the cruise. We paid a premium for a cruise with no kids and there were no risque activities at all. All the events were mostly wellness events (morning yoga, understanding your gut health, etc), or too cheesy/cringe such as a 90s boy band dance lesson. The most exciting one was a dodgeball game which they only held twice, and everything else was meh, such as the puzzle speed building and trivia. They had a painting-while-you-drink class but you had to pay for it, and it was sold out by the time I boarded the cruise. Aside from that, I thought it was cool that they had a few events for solo passengers to get to know each other and participate in activities. But beware if you're expecting tons to do - I had to find ways to entertain myself by bringing my journal and sketch pad. 

**Arcade/Game Room:** I don't spend much time at the arcade on a cruise. If I go it's only on late nights when I'm bored. This one had a decent arcade filled with a bunch of retro machines that were all free to play. They had a 2 racing games but weren't connected for co-op. Best part about the game room were the two long table shuffleboards. They also had foosball and a huge selection of board games. 

**Karaoke:** Probably the 2nd biggest let down of the cruise. For Virgin having all this ""you're a rockstar"" vibe and energy everywhere on the cruise, I was expecting an entire auditorium or club dedicated to karaoke. Nope - they had a shitty PA system set up in the same hallway where the arcade was. The worst part is that they held it right outside of the Steakhouse restaurant, so when I dined in there, I could hear the blast of terrible singing through the doors. They *did* have a few rooms for private karaoke, but there was no one tending to the station when I checked it out so that was a waste of time.

**Clubs/Shows:** This is the cruise's wheelhouse. Their main club ""The Manor"" is a fully-equipped club with 2 stories, lasers, fog machines, dancers, and plenty of lounge areas to chill when you're not on the dance floor. My only complaint about the clubs and parties is that the music sucks. The majority of their songs were essentially EDM remixes of popular songs. The shows themselves had really great production value for being cruises. My only observation is that these shows are definitely geared for the LGTBQ+ crowd, so you'll see a few performers in drag. I don't care about it at all but if you or someone you know isn't comfortable with that, then there's your warning. I'd also like to point out that at the lounge at the center of the ship, they have a few bands play there and it's an awesome post-dinner vibe.

**Casino:** I'm not a big gambler, but the casino was pretty solid. In addition to the usual slot machines, there were $10, $15, $25, and $100 tables of blackjack during the casino's peak hours. They also had roulette and craps. I was disappointed because there was a $1/$2 Texas Hold'em Tourney at 10pm, but it ended up being a digital poker table that seats 12. It was extremely easy to look at other people's cards because of the way the table is designed so I stopped playing midway because it was pointless.

**Gym/Fitness:** This is the other part the cruise nailed. The ship has a track on the top of the deck for people who like to walk, jog, run. It's pretty small but I enjoyed getting a morning run in with in the middle of the ocean - very refreshing air. It's also got a small basketball court that lights up at night where they also hold the dodgeball games. In the actual gym area, they have a ton of workout machines and equipment to use. They also had a small boxing ring on one side of the deck and outdoor fitness structures like bars to do sit-ups, push-ups, etc.

**Other:** They give you a wristband with a plastic module before you board the ship. That's how you enter your room and pay for your drinks. I'm not a fan of wearing accessories, but I thought it was extremely convenient to not have to worry about misplacing a room key. What's also cool is that the Virgin Beach Resort in Bimini functions the same way. Saves the hassle of needing to bring cash and all that to buy drinks. The resort itself looked very nice and clean, but again, there wasn't much to do aside from going into the water or lounging. Side note - **the app fucking sucks.** When I tried using it before and during the cruise, it would constantly crash and setting the reservations was a mission. I get what they're trying to do with it, but they need a better system for that.

**BOTTOM LINE - Scarlet Lady is the perfect cruise if you're looking for something more low-key and relaxing with your partner. Don't expect the raunchy festivities like the commercials make it seem. Granted, everyone brings their own energy to the party, but even with no kids this ship, it failed to meet the hype. It's definitely not worth paying the premium in my experience, but it definitely proved that cruises can have amazing food and drinks.**",[REVIEW] Virgin Voyage - Scarlett Lady,,alexdoo,,0,2023-03-27 21:00:40

Cruise,"I just got off the Carnival Paradise yesterday. This was my first cruise since 2016. I've done pretty much all the main lines Carnival, Royal Caribbean, NCL and Princess. Also, my first one as a parent of a five year old.

Overall, we had a great time. The ship is older and smaller, but it was fine. We did a few things to save money like each brought on one bottle of wine (don't forget the corkscrew) and a 12 pack of pop. I can certainly live without pop for a week, but having it was super convenient. I've gotten the Bubbles package before and I found it actually a little annoying to have to go to the bar and get a drink. This way I just used the (not really great but worked a little) fridge in my stateroom and grabbed a can on the way to meals. 

Let's talk meals first. I had Guy's Burgers three times and I thought it was great. I love cheeseburgers though. I read somewhere else that the quality is like of Chili's, which is fine because I enjoy Chili's. I also liked the pizza and appreciated that they gave you a half personal pizza because I really can't eat that much. We ate dinner each night in the MDR and I didn't really care for it except the first night when I had like a chicken parmesan dish. My husband liked most of his though.

One pet peeve I do have is how hard it is to get a freaking peanut butter and jelly sandwich. That's one of the only things my kid will eat and you could only get it through room service (extra charge - nearly $6 for PB&amp;J) or at the MDR. The MDR was OK, but my kid is still really young and getting him to sit still after a long day of water slides and swimming was a challenge. Next cruise, I am literally just going to bring packets of PB and J on board because I can always get bread from the sandwich station. I would understand if they don't do PB&amp;J because of allergy issues, but they had it out for breakfast for the bagels, so that's not why.

We also had a mini-suite stateroom (specifically V1) and the size of the room was good and nice closets and layout. However, the balcony was not private at all. It was awkward sometimes because we would be sitting there and someone would walk by on the stairs and see us and do a double take. I will definitely be more discerning with picking the stateroom next time! 

The ship amenities were great for families. I saw tons of kids (I think it was FL's spring break). The ship has five water slides and a splash pad area. The two smallest water slides are perfect for preschoolers. My husband and I even went on the big water slide to encourage my son to go on it, and we thought it was fun. The pool itself was freezing, which has been the case with every (3) cruise I've been on. The hot tubs by the pool area were like kid soup (it said no kids under 6 so thankfully I kept my kid out of it). The hot tubs in serenity were kid-free though. I did see a Carnival crew member chase out some noisy teenagers from Serenity so that was appreciated. My son also loved the min-golf and kid's club. You cannot go wrong with childcare included (until 10PM then it's a flat hourly rate) on the vacation. He only went for a couple hours a day to socialize with other kids and give us a break.

Alcohol is a lot more than I remember. I think it used to be like $10 a drink, now it's $15 for a daquiri. I didn't mind though because I had my wine I brought and I'm a light drinker. They have lovely lime edible straws and chocolate straws in the coffee shop which were nice.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good. My last Carnival cruise was ten years ago and I still think they are fine. I did expect some cuts in things because of post-COVID life, but it was fine. I can see us making plans to go again in 2024 as well.",Carnival Paradise: March 2023 Review,,loveskittles,,0,2023-03-26 16:39:31

I called several times with no luck, in March I booked another cruise for April and due to the payment schedule had to pay it in full. End of March I finally get the cruise credit, and guess what? Because the cruise is paid in full I can‚Äôt use the credit anymore. I sent several emails trying to escalate to a manager and have the credit converted into on board credit but no one answered the email. Finally I tried one last thing and DMed celebrity on twitter, they answered within hours. And by the following day they approved a one time exception to convert my credit to on board credit.

Cruise,"Hello Alaska cruisers!  My wife (35F) and I (41M) are looking for an Alaska cruise, and thanks to the posts and advice I've seen on here, I've landed on Princess being the likely best option for us.  I think I've found the itinerary we're aiming for, but I was hoping to get some thoughts from others who may have done this before and would know things I do not.

**The Itinerary:** Vancouver &gt; Ketchikan &gt; Juneau &gt; Skagway &gt; Glacier Bay National Park &gt; College Fjord &gt; Anchorage (Whittier), mid-May 2024

**The Ship:** Sapphire Princess, Princess Cruises - Balcony Room

**Itinerary Features We Care About:**

* Well-rounded itinerary with a taste of the highlights for Alaska cruising
* My wife *really* wants an opportunity to see the Northern Lights
* We like to see and learn about nature but won't be broken-hearted if we don't see wildlife
* We like to explore the history and food of port towns we haven't visited before (we've never been to Alaska)

**Ship Features We Care About:**

* Okay, don't judge too harshly, but we've mostly cruised Carnival in the Caribbean; for Alaska, we wanted to go with something higher-end because we are tired of something always inevitably being broken or not operating correctly on the ship that should absolutely be taken care of (like A/C or heat, or obvious signs of the air system not being cleaned, which has also made us nervous about cruising on older ships)
* Good meal offerings included with the fare (main dining room, buffet, ice cream, late night options) because we never really took too much interest in specialty dining
* A good WiFi plan is a bonus, but not a necessity
* Coffee bar!  And we like to enjoy an alcoholic beverage once in a while, but we typically don't exceed 1 drink/day each.  Bonus if there's sweet champagne or sparking wine.
* Other fun activities during downtime like karaoke, trivia, movies, live music (we saw an electric string trio - two violins and a cello - on a ship once that we absolutely loved!)

In reading reviews and comparing what I've seen online, Princess seems to check our boxes for satisfaction in food quality and casual environment, experience in cruising Alaska, and we were super interested to hear about Princess bringing wildlife and nature specialists on board to talk about the natural environment we're cruising through.  We were pretty confident that we didn't want to go with Carnival or RCCL, because we wanted to find a more ""premium"" experience for Alaska.  HAL and Celebrity, for some reason, didn't strike me as the vibe we're going for, but I could be off the mark there.  My other consideration was NCL, but they seem to have a lot of extra stuff we don't care about, and reviews I've read suggest that included meals aren't great, and that there's a lot of nickel-and-diming to coax you into buying premium packages instead.  But again, I could be wrong.

I'm super confused by several comments in cruising threads about Spring Break and children. Comments that you should expect more children during Spring Break cruising.

For context I've just recently returned to cruising after a 20+ year break and have a cruise this Sunday on NCL Bliss.

Also for the record I don't mind children at all. I'm a child at heart myself really.

So do children have a spring break nowadays? I think of college kids when I think of Spring Break as when I was kid back in the 70s/80s we only had Summer Break from June to end of August. It wasn't until I was in college that I had a spring break, which in those days was Ft. Lauderdale and MTV beach parties (shout out to Ed Lover).

Cruise,"Good morning everyone!

 I'm taking my first cruise this May on NCL and I'm super excited. I'm big on budgeting and haven't really planned for the excursions, and now i see that the majority have early start times only (730a) and I'm not too thrilled to get up and directly go on an excursion. I plan to do one and take advantage of my $50 excursion credit. I was wondering if there are any people out there that have forgone the excursions and made their own plans or booked experiences, and if so how was it and what did you do? And do you have any tips or opinions on this? 

Stops: St Thomas, D.R Amber Cove, P.R San Juan. 

Any opinions or tips are much appreciated!

Went back and forth on deciding on stateroom for ages before selecting one of the whirlpool grand suites. We‚Äôre not very peoplely and I wanted a space we could relax in privately. The room was $4k for a 7 night cruise. 

Today we got offered to bid on an upgrade. Either a yacht club with deck view (significantly smaller room/deck than what we have, no hot tub) for $500 per person. Or one of the duplex whirlpool suites (still a smaller deck) for‚Ä¶ $2k per person. 

The numbers aren‚Äôt adding up. The yacht club room with a deck was only $3.5k total if we went with that option originally. The duplex was $6.5k. With bids we‚Äôd be paying at minimum $5k or $8k total. 

Obviously we‚Äôre not gonna bid on the upgrades, but is this normal? Do they offer the same minimum bid to all non-yacht club staterooms?

Cruise,"Hello All!

Sailing on Norwegian Escape 5/21-5/28 and made the now-regrettable decision to allow NCL to book my flights (before coming on here and reading how bad of an idea that is).  I very much got a Jekyll &amp; Hyde itinerary: the return trip is totally fine (a direct flight FLL-PHL on American) but the incoming trip is a nightmare: 2 Southwest flights with a 70-minute connection in Atlanta, and not arriving to Fort Lauderdale until 12:15 on embarkation day.   

Obviously I did it to myself by not deviating to arrive the day before, and will likely bite the bullet and just book a flight to arrive earlier, it's just too risky because if I miss the connection, I likely miss embarkation.  But I'm also aware of the whole ""if you no-show, the rest of your flight tickets will be cancelled"" policy.  My question is: since I'm ticketed to fly back on American and not Southwest, would American even know if I didn't fly the Southwest flights?  The two airlines are NOT codeshare or partner airlines.  The flight info from the other airline does show up on each airline's itinerary, but I figured that was more for convenience's sake from the reservation system.  Currently there's no inexpensive options to fly back on the 28th so I'd rather retain the original return flight and wouldn't want to forfeit the return tickets, but getting to the cruise/embarkation is the higher priority!  

And yes, I did already call the NCL Airline reservation number about asking for a less-tight connection time and got the ""too bad, so sad, can't do anything"" spiel from the agent since it's less than 75 days until sailing.","NCL Air: Booked on 2 separate airlines, is a partial no-show possible?",,rdevlin92,,0,2023-03-23 21:23:29

Original Post: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/vgs5ic/you_think_norwegian_will_refund_us_missed_cruise/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb


I just have to say, Norwegian customer service when it comes to refunds is beyond a nightmare.

I‚Äôll start at the start‚Ä¶

We reached out to customer service via the phone/email. They kept just telling us to go to AirCanada customer service, which then then in turn just told us to go back to Norwegian. 

After this annoying back and forth for about 2 weeks they finally gave us this refund form to submit. Which of course was denied  within 1 day.

We responded to the denial since it came from an actual person and they responded about a week later (with corporate jargon but it pretty much said:) they spoke to their higher ups and still settled on no refund.

We then had to find fine print (ON OUR OWN) that referenced something along the lines of ‚Äútaxes, excursions, and any prepaid credit will be refunded for a missed cruise‚Äù.

We sent them this to which they responded after almost a month (and with us having to follow up) and they agreed with and offered us about $1000 cruise credit‚Ä¶ (about $4000 less than we spent).

This was still unacceptable to us so I went and sent emails to every employee I could find to explain our situation‚Ä¶. I went on LinkedIn and found all of the customer service managers and emailed them directly.

We heard nothing‚Ä¶

We then decided to go all in and make a bluff. We sent the rep in the denial chain an email mentioning that we would be pursuing legal action (listed a random lawyer and everything), it was very legit looking.

And guess what!!!

2 days later they offered us a full refund (in cruise credit, as well as an upgrade to our room when we rebook). Which we accepted and rebooked our honeymoon for this summer. A week long Alaskan Cruise in the biggest family suite!

So moral of the story, screw Norwegian Customer service, legal threats are the best bet, and we still love ya Norwegian cruises.",Follow up post! (You think Norwegian will refund us? (Missed cruise due to delays/cancellations) ),,WakeAndWin,,0,2023-03-22 22:44:41

Today I got an email offer from the Blue Chip Club regarding a comp ocean view cruise offer for some sailings in May/June, mostly European ports. 

Logistically, only a couple of them are workable options for me, none for my partner. I have a few questions that I‚Äôm hoping someone who‚Äôs experienced or knows a bit about could provide some insight:

1. If I pass on this offer this time, is there a chance another will come around in the comings months/year+? Asking because typically the second half of the calendar year is usually the best time logistically for us to make things happen, versus spring.

2. Does anyone have an idea what the rough cost/% discount is (if any) extended to the guest of primary sailer if I would take advantage? 

3. Do Captains Club points accumulate on casino comp‚Äôd cruises? My assumption is no, because comp, but figured worth asking to take into account.

I ask these because it was pretty light on details outside of requesting passenger info &amp; cruise preference for a future call to schedule.

Cruise,"I absolutely love going on cruises, I personally find them to be my favorite form of vacation. Why take a flight to Bermuda when you can just cruise there, not have to worry about finding a place to stay/places to eat, and party the entire time on the way to and from?

Although I understand that it's not really for everyone, and unfortunately for me most of my friends feel that way. While a lot of them have been on cruises (with or without me) before, some just would prefer another type of vacation.

I've always been keen on meeting new people, especially me being in my 20s, to travel with but I was surprised to find out that cruises are not really looked at as an overall ""enjoyable"" form of vacation, at least in the eye of the general public. I always tell people to try at least one cruise and your mind will change, and for the most part it has worked, but I can see that I'm more of a cruise ""enthusiast"" than my other friends.

Which leads me to my question. I always keep an eye out for good deals on cruises and when I find one, I usually have no choice but to let it slip by as the majority of the time I can't find people who want to go. Whether that be because they're busy, don't want to spend the money, don't like cruises, are ""scared of the Titanic"", I've heard every excuse in the book. I would love to find a platform where I can meet some other young cruise enthusiasts who are also keen on hopping on a good cruise deal when presented with one!",Is there a platform to find people to cruise with?,,BoyBrandeenoo,,0,2023-03-22 20:43:47

Cruise,"I‚Äôm a college student who is doing research on potentially going on a cruise line over the Winter Break (some time between December 2023 - January 2024). All of us would prefer to go on a cruise which has a similar age demographic to ours (early-mid 20‚Äôs). We would all prefer to go on a cruise during the Winter, as most of us will not be able to financially afford a cruise until later this year, and the warm weather would be a nice reprieve from New England.

An article that I recently read (linked below!) stated that is that cruise lines generally attract younger passengers during the warmer seasons (Spring/Summer Break), and that during the colder seasons the cruise lines mostly consists of elderly folk.

Given that many colleges offer Winter Breaks, are there any time slots during the Winter in which there is a stronger presence of college students? I recognize that there are other variables to consider (the cruise line itself, the regions, etc.), as well as the fact that cruises broadly already lean towards older folks, but I would still like to know how the seasons, if at all, impact the age demographics of cruises.

Cruise," Just got back off of Carnival newest ship the Celebration, and boy oh boy is it a mixed bag. 

First things first, there were 4 of us in a family harbor suite me and my wife (mid 30's) and our two kids (7 M, and 22mo F). 

The room was adequate and had plenty of storage. The beds were comfy in the hotel kind of way. The only issue with the layout was with the door to the room being making it very hard to get our stroller in and out on port days.

The cleanliness of the room left much to be desired, as my little one found leftover peanuts from the previous guests on the first night in the room. These were just loose on the ground not in a package or anything like that. As time went by I also found where some soda had splashed one of the cabinets and had dried into a syrupy mess, also there before we got the room. The bathroom doors handle already had several screws loose and was coming away from the door.

The bathroom itself was cramped, but the shower had plenty of room and I never felt crowded will showering (I'm a larger guy 5'9 230 lb), but that did come at the expense of the rest of the bathroom which felt very crowded. 

My son enjoyed the water slides on the back of the ship, except for one which was always out of service (the drop slide), and while he was not tall enough to ride the Bolt roller coaster it wouldn't have mattered since it was down for maintenance most of the time. However he ended up spending most of his time in Camp Ocean where he had a blast.

my daughter on the other hand enjoyed her time, but was not as well taken care of. Celebration offers ""Turtles"" level of care which is 0 - 1. This was a big selling point for us as we have cruised with Royal and they have nursery care as well. The hours for this care however where horrible. I tried to look up the hours before the cruise but they were not posted anywhere.  On sea days they would watch her from 8am - 10am (maybe), and 10pm - 1am, and on port days it was 3-4 hours of the port stay but off set in away that you would miss about half of the day if you used it (we did not), then the 10pm - 1am all of this at $9 hr + tip. Considering how much of a selling point this was and how much Carnival was hyping it up this is disgraceful. While I'm not saying we should be able to drop her off all day, the availability made it impossible for me and the wife to have a nice dinner or catch one of the shows just the two of us. This was not an issue on Royal.

The food was a mixed bag. The main Dining room never had anything that made me go wow, except for their melting cake desert. However Guys burger joint was wonderful greasy goodness, Big chicken and some of the best chicken I have had in a long time, and The Pig and Anchor was amazing as well. The steakhouse was not good or worth the extra charge. We skipped the seafood restaurant. The ""pop up"" street eats where always good, and I love the idea of a new small themed snack everyday. I ordered the Seafood shacks buffalo shrimp one time, and while it was made to order and very good, it was not buffalo. It was more of a thai chili sauce. The pizza was good late night food and always a kid pleaser. Deco Deli's  sandwiches where all good as well. The sushi Restaurant was hit or miss, but that is not an thing I normally do, and my wife loved everything there so take that for what is worth. The Japanese steak house was wonderful, large portions of good food with a light hearted show to go with it. However the best food hands down was at Emeril's. Everything was amazing, not a bad thing on the menu.

The Casino was there. I am a big Crapps player, I enjoy the atmosphere and getting to know the other players. Carnival did not make this easy. First off it was a $15 table (other lines are $10, they said it was a big ship tax...), second only about a third of the dealers knew what was going on( this caused 10 plus min waits between rolls sometimes ) and they would constantly misplace your bets or not pay you out right. This caused issues, and regularly spoiled the atmosphere at the table. Third pretty much anything goes with the dice. Throw it just over the halfway point on the tabe no where near the back wall, no issues. Toss the dice over everyone's heads, no issues. Hit people with the dice! As long as the dice landed back on the table, it was all good. At one point in time someone threw in their money and card as the shooter was throwing and got hit by the dice and it was counted. I stayed because it was the only game in town, but never again.

And we have to talk about the kids. At all hours of the day and night there were packs of kids roaming the Lido deck, buffets, and other halls. Most of the time this was not an issue, however when it was it was because a 15 -17 yr old where fighting in the buffet (Carnival did not break it up, and this ""play"" fighting bumped into several other guest as well as knocking over a small child) or a group of 10-12 yr olds running through the halls bumping into other guests screaming profanities the whole time. I don't know the solution to this but I will not be coming back so I don't have to worry about it.

Overall the staff were always kind, except for one person who gave me an ""that's not my job"" when asking for replacement silverware. Apparently their shift had ended, but they were still in full uniform.",Carnival Celebration 7 day out of Miami review.,,RogueGuardianStudios,,0,2023-03-21 01:56:55

Cruise,"I have a situation that I can't find answers to anywhere online.

My brother booked a solo room on Norwegian. At the time, the cost for his solo room was around $1500 total ($599 cruise fare). A few weeks ago, a friend decided that they were going to go. We called and added him into the room, but the fare had nearly doubled to $1,029 (Please see image for cost breakdown.).

Now, the friend does not have the money to go on the cruise. He is looking to not have to pay at all. No payments have been made aside from the $125 deposit at the initial booking. If we were to remove the friend, would my brother still be expected to pay the full *current* price, or would he be reverted back to his original price? I know there is the worry of a solo supplement, but I'm just a little confused since he was originally solo, but with a much lower rate.

Cruise,"Ahoy! Currently on the Oasis of the Seas and just had two very weird instances where I felt beyond confused. 

My husband and I always get the unlimited dining and drinks package just because we love the specialty dinings. We‚Äôve always been under the impression that once you have the dining you can only reserve once you board the ship, which is why this time we boarded as early as allowed and beelined to make reservations only to find out you could do it via app. However, previously I had called and had always been told otherwise that I would be charged etc since the app doesn‚Äôt recognize the meal package. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is how have you guys done this before with the dining packages?

Also for the a la carte how does it work now? Nobody in the ship seems to know if the $20 stipend is per day or 1 time use.

Cruise,"The NCL website isn't exactly clear enough for me personally on what the luggage rules are in comparison to airlines. Ive gathered this from their FAQ which feels very vague to me: 

How many suitcases can I bring?

\- Each person is allowed up to two pieces of personal luggage on board, with each piece weighing a maximum of 50 pounds

Should I bring on a carry-on bag?

\- Guests should bring a spare overnight bag because all suitcases are collected the night before we return to homeport.

‚Ä¢ Luggage that is being hand-carried must be able to fit thru the x-ray machines, similar to airplanes if larger than that it must be checked. (Approximately 24‚Äù tall and 18‚Äù wide)

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I really rather avoid checking in my luggage. How much carry-on luggage can you get away with? Would we be limited to only 1 carry on bag per guest or can I have a carry on back and a personal bag (like a backpack). Its a 1 week trip so I don't think I need a full suitcase really.

Cruise,"Hi ya'll, just wanted to share my experience on the MSC Meraviglia. This was mine and my wife's 3rd cruise and first on an MSC ship (the other two were Carnival and NCL). We're in our 30s, but the family group we were in ranged from 20s to 70s.

Right off the bat, the lines. From embarkation to buffets, it seemed we spent a good chunk of our vacation in lines. And the drink and bar lines were unacceptably long. We're talking waiting upwards of 30 minutes for a drink. This was a spring break cruise, so I understand it's a bit more of a booze heavy cruise, but they were still much too long. My family and other passengers were not happy, and you could kind of tell it affected the entire vibe of the cruise. 

They also straight up ran out of drinks. On the Ocean Cay reserve, their signature island drink that was plastered at all the different bars was gone by 10:30 am. The island wasn't even hopping at this point. Speaking of the island, the line issue followed us there. And they closed different bars without any seeming rhyme or reason. It seemed anywhere you went, there was a hourly rotation of what's available and what's not. 

Back in the cabin, we purchased a bottle of wine for the room. It was there, it was overpriced for what it was (which is fine, I knew going into it that it would be), but it was a corked bottle. So we had to call down to the desk to get them to open it with a corkscrew. They never showed up. So I said forget it, and just waited the next day to call at a non-busy time. This time, someone actually showed up to open the bottle but it was apparent that this was the first time they've used a corkscrew. It took about 10 minutes for her to open it, and by the end the cork was a mangled mess with bits of cork floating around the bottle. Wolverine would have made cleaner work of it using his claws. Why not just give us a fucking screw top? It's already a whatever bottle of wine, who gives a fuck if it has a screw top. 

Other negative notes: Buffet was confusing, the casino had a pitiful amount of table games, music and deck parties were just kind of generic. 

The good: I actually liked the food. The room was designed nicely, but it wasn't very clean when we boarded (house keeping forgot to clean one of the desk draws and it had old candy wrappers in it). I liked the pools on the ship as well. Oh and the F1 simulator was fun as fuck. I wanted to be like Kimi but I spun out like Mazepin. 

Folks, this post has gone on long enough but I could keep going with the complaints. To sum it up, the service was so bad that it amplified every other issue we had. I'd say if they hired more people, it would solve a lot of their issues. But I don't think they will. Look at my comment on the casino: Very few table games. Why? You need dealers to man those tables. If they're not even willing to hire extra staff for a guaranteed moneymaker like casino table games, there's no way in hell they're hiring more people to give you drinks you've already payed for.",Cruise Report: MSC Meraviglia 3/12-3/16 (It's not good),,ChicagoToAVL,,0,2023-03-20 20:19:38

Cruise,"Me and my GF were meant to go on a Norwegian fjords cruise on the Queen Mary last year. This is our very first and possibly only cruise. We were concerned about getting covid on board and having our holiday ruined (this has happened to us before and it wasn't pleasent) so we pushed it back to this year, same itinerary but on the Queen Victoria instead.

Anyway, I was looking up more information on the Victoria and was alarmed to see a lot of recent negative reviews for Cunard on tripadvisor. A big chunk seem to be about an incident where the Victoria was dry-docked for three days for repairs which is whatever, but I'm also seeing a lot of people saying the cruises across all ships have degraded noticeably following the covid reopening. Bad food, the ships are run-down and dirty, and the staff seeming overworked and exhausted are the common complaints.

This has me reconsidering (I've only paid the deposit, don't have to commit until August) as this could be a once in a lifetime experience for us and I'd hate to be let down. I'm also not really comfortable supporting a company that's mistreating their exmployees. And I'm disabled so I guess I'd have safety concerns about being on a ship that's under-staffed.

Has anyone here been on a Cunard cruise in the last few months? Are these complaints true, or are people just being salty about the dry-docking incident? (Even some of the reviewers that weren't on the Victoria cruise in question were bringing it up, which kind of made me suspicious that people were review-bombing the cruise line).

It was a fairly cold day in NOLA and we get on board and get into our room. The room had the thermostat turned to cold so we turned it up to heat.

It's colder in our room than the chilly air outside. The hallway is warm. He calls maintenance and I check back at 30min and at an hour. He told me to also call guest services.

Cruise,"Currently on adventure of the seas 4-night Galveston to Cozumel and back with wife, 3 kids (3,5,6) nanny and mother in law.  Have two 2-bedroom grand suites.  

Tldr:  can't get more than one ounce of whiskey and bottled water hard to come by.

Wasn't planning on drinking much anyway since I am with my kids but when I want a drink I like a decent-size glass of Irish whiskey on the rocks.  Nothing special needed - Jameson is fine.

Day 1, after finally getting let into our room, I have  15 minutes free with wife to get a drink in bar in promenade and I order a double Jameson on the rocks.  Bartender says no doubles and pours me literally one ounce in a glass.  Once I figure out he's not joking I say fine and drink it quickly and order another (time is limited) and he tells me I have to wait 10 minutes for my safety.  I don't blame the bartender I'm sure he's just following rules but Jesus Christ.  I'm a 42 year old grown man and don't need my already limited consumption throttled by policy.  I'm not some spring break kid.

Come to find out it is this way at every bar here.  

This is psychotic.

I've only been on one previous cruise, ncl in January 4 nighter out of Miami.  Had haven 3 bedroom garden villa.  No comparison on room, which is to be expected, it cost substantially more.  But if I went to any bar there they would make pretty much whatever I wanted anytime.  If i ordered a double Jameson and it lookeda little light I asked the bartender to fill it up some more and they would.   I don't think that's too much to ask.

Also, bottles water on ncl were abundant and always available everywhere it seemed. Here it is difficult to find.  Ended up paying $65 for two cases from room service so family wouldn't dehydrate.

I just returned from an 11 night on the Constellation and am happy to say Celebrity far exceeded my expectations and had many delicious offerings.  From the feedback I got on my last post and that I‚Äôve seen on Facebook groups, there does seem to be some consistency issues between boats/sailings, so hopefully they continue to work on that.  But for the most part, we had good to excellent meals (especially in the Tuscan Grille and at Le Petit Chef).  Room service was much better, maybe now because it has a charge (edible, warm eggs!).  I will say I think they still aren‚Äôt so great at ‚Äúcomfort foods‚Äù (was unable to find a tasty Mac and cheese and the nacho/queso and refried beans should be thrown overboard), so keeping to more specialized options seems to work better.  The Indian is still amazing though, that was the highlight of my lunch buffet each day!

I will say I was also blown away by the service on the Constellation.  The crew was truly superb and went out of their way to make us feel special and to ensure we were enjoying our trip.  The crew really set our experience apart and way above any other cruise we‚Äôve been on.  We ended up with a norovirus outbreak and the crew immediately did everything they could to stop the spread.  I even saw the activities director walking around cleaning surfaces!  By the end, we could tell the crew were exhausted from extra cleaning/serving duties but they still kept the same level of service.

Honestly I was so shocked at how bad the food at Lido was. It was on par with eating at Golden Corral. 
Additionally, I don‚Äôt drink that much alcohol and just getting simple water or soda water was SO DIFFICULT. I know this was the first completely sold out cruise since Covid, but it seemed like the cruise was miserably full. We‚Äôd stand in line for 20 minutes just trying to get a small can of club soda lol. Not worth it for the cheers package. You also have to wait 5 minutes to get any drinks back to back, even water! 

One coffee bar on this ship for nearly 4,000 people. Those girls are amazing and need a raise lol. Churi and Kareen busted their asses constantly for their entire shifts. Good job ladies üòç

For the room, our king sized bed was two twins put together which was horrible. We were on deck 2 in the aft area, which was quiet and the room was a good size. The shower fit us both and we enjoyed the bathroom size as well. We had a fridge and asked for a fan, which was brought within 12 hours. Definitely a must, because the rooms can be stuffy. We had a window, but our family had an interior room and I definitely would recommend against that if you‚Äôre claustrophobic at all. 

Gym was adequate. I was hoping there would be decent stationary bikes, but there were 2 working ones that were very old. The free weights were nice. Be prepped that if you‚Äôre an avid gym goer, it was packed with people who clearly had no clue what they were doing on the first day or two. Then it starts to fizzle out and the last couple of days, the gym was empty. 

They nickel and dime you to death. I‚Äôm not going to pay an additional 20-50 bucks for dinner just for something acceptable. $10 for a photo they take with you at dinner, and the excursions had a lot of hidden fees or required extra money for taking photos. We went to half moon cay and the gift shop was closed and conveniently the Cheers package didn‚Äôt work so we had the lovely opportunity to pay $17.50 each for a watered down margarita. There are a total of 4 water stations on the ship, all located on Deck 9 near the buffet. 

How is there only one hot tub for adults? There were kids in the hot tubs outside of the serenity bar, and so you basically had to just hop into the one at the top with like 15 other people. The adult serenity area was overly populated with young 20-something‚Äôs just getting absolutely hammered, so not quite a serene or relaxing experience. 

Karaoke was not a live band. I‚Äôve been on another carnival cruise (the Fantasy/Legend, I think) and it was a full on band playing the songs in a large lounge. This sunshine ship just has the karaoke in a small pub or area by a pub with speakers. Mid experience af. 

THE BEST part of the cruise was our tour guide in Nassau! Perry and Mary with Divine Servants tour guides. Extremely affordable, large and clean van, the guy knew so much about the history and culture of the Bahamas and he was a native that had grown up in the poorer area and worked hard to succeed. Totally recommend to everyone. 

Overall, I‚Äôm not so impressed. The service was great for the amount of crazy spring break kids but the food and opportunities were not worth the price. I think it‚Äôs a great cruise for those that really enjoy shopping at Walmart and their idea of a good dinner is chilis. 

This experience just turned me off of cruises for good. I‚Äôll spend the same amount of money flying to Hawaii or across the pond. ‚úåÔ∏è",Carnival cruise experience and thoughts.,,TheGildedDildoArises,,0,2023-03-18 16:31:01

Before even getting on the ship, the security checkpoint was just full of older people who looked miserable for people about to begin a 12 day vacation. We had some few rude encounters with people on the ship unprovoked (like I said, they were older). We were on a family vacation with our parents and my grandma and her sister, so my parents and my brother were probably the youngest ones on the ship. I'm 20 and my brother is 17.. we were the youngest ones there (besides the crew who were more or less my age). They lost our luggage and we didn't get it back until late that night. The food often came cold or raw. A lot of employees were very kind and I had long conversations with some, but others were just straight up rude, especially in the shops. The ship moved a LOT which isn't necessarily their fault but it's still uncomfortable to deal with. I got my hair blown out at the salon and they left it a MESS... super frizzy and dry. I had to go back in and ask for them to redo it (which I hate doing but it was just so bad). There was also nothing to do. Everything was shut down by 10 pm. The shows felt like high school theatre productions. Like I said, a lot of the staff was very kind and accommodating but that's all I can really give this cruise.

Hope everyone is well.

About to bite the bullet on my first cruise - it's only a mini cruise out if England end of September, it goes over to Ireland and back. 

Given the time of year, I expect the weather won't be particularly good (hopefully it stays dry at least)... Its more so that we want to experience a big cruise ship, and then hopefully book a proper one round Europe/Carribbean at some stage over the next couple of years. 

My question is, will the pools on board the Virtuosa be heated? I know there is an indoor pool, but will the outdoor pools still be a decent temperature - or will they be freezing because they rely on the sun?

- Can travel agents book the Yacht Club? (Not a cabin option on cruisecompete)
- (Pending space still available) Can I upgrade later to Yacht Club for the price difference? Would it be the price difference based on what I see now or whatever it is when upgraded (ie, booking for $4k now, Yacht is $8k, if in future Yacht is $9k would it be $4k or $5k extra?)

Cruise,"I posted recently about being interested in going on a cruise for the first time in 2024, and I want to go to the Norwegian Fjords, ideally as far north as possible. I don't want to fly so I'm looking at departure ports in the UK. I've looked at various options and Fred Olsen looks very nice (and one of their ports is only 30 minute from home) but expensive particularly for a solo traveler. For a cheaper price I could get a longer cruise in a better cabin with P&amp;O - and having a private balcony to read, drink tea and admire the scenery really appeals to me. 

But online reviews for the P&amp;O Arcadia, which is the ship I'm looking at, are mostly pretty negative. Does anyone have any recent experiences? For what it's worth I'm not a demanding traveler and most of my holidays are spent camping in either a tent or the back of my minivan, so I think having a bed and a hot shower is pretty luxurious in itself.

Cruise,"At 29 I'm going on my first cruise in December, on RC Odyssey of the Seas. It leaves out of Ft Lauderdale, going to CocoBay, Haiti, and DR. I've been on 3 all inclusive vacations in my life- so far to Punta Cana twice and Cancun once.  


To be honest, I think I'd rather do that again just based on the cost benefit analysis, but my friend group really wants to try a cruise. So I'm just wondering for those who have done both, how do they differ? Because from what I can tell;  


With an all inclusive vacation say to Punta Cana, 2 people can go to a resort for 6 nights including flights for about $1200, to $1400. And you can genuinely get away with not spending another dime while having a luxurious time. All food is included, including several different restaurants for classy meals or the buffet for casual. Wifi is included throughout the resort. Of course, alcohol is included. You tip at your discretion, and a couple of dollars here and there goes a long way. There is live entertainment every night.  


On this cruise, it seems like everything is an upgrade and has an extra cost on top of the $1600 already paid. Wifi is not included, need an upgrade. Alcohol is not included, need a drink package. Many of the food options on board are not included, need a package. Tips are mandatory and added at the end. You need to fly in a day early and get a hotel, there's another $200. So while an all inclusive can be about $1000 per person when all is accounted for, if I want to drink on this cruise then when you account for everything it is more like $2000 per person.  


So I'm not bashing on the experience as I have never done it before, I'm just genuinely curious do you feel the experience is twice as good as an all inclusive island vacation?",How would you compare a Caribbean cruise to an all inclusive vacation to one of the Caribbean islands?,,Life123456,,0,2023-03-17 13:05:03

Cruise,"I booked my first cruise on MSC 3 weeks ago and was/am pretty excited. Since then I‚Äôve been getting more stressed and worried about the cruise. 

First is the poor quality of food and lack of bar service that I‚Äôve been seeing posted. Food isn‚Äôt too big of a deal for me, I consider myself a human garbage disposal so I‚Äôll try anything as long as it tastes decent. However, paying for the drink package I truly hope I don‚Äôt regret splurging because bar service is slow and I‚Äôve heard they don‚Äôt have waiters coming to take drink orders at tables. 

The most frustrating part so far is their awful website and bad customer service. When I tried to login to my account after booking I got an error, gave it a couple days then decided to call to try to fix it. After on hold for 30 mins the person couldn‚Äôt even help me, they said it‚Äôs a ‚Äúglitch in the system‚Äù which I found out to be untrue, it‚Äôs because the emails differed from my account and booking so I had to make a new account for my booking. I couldn‚Äôt edit or add the email linked to my booking to the account I created. The customer service agent also told me the ship is sailing out of manhattan NY, which come to find out it sails out of Brooklyn. Thankfully I noticed or they could have messed up an entire travel day. 

A few days after I situated my account (with no help from customer support) I noticed the price of my cruise dropped over $100. I searched online to see if they price match and I got mixed answers, half say yes they‚Äôve done it the other half say no they don‚Äôt. So I called customer support again. The agent said she was not seeing the cheaper price I was and to send screenshots of the price I‚Äôm seeing to their existing booking department‚Äôs email so they can fix it for me. 

A week goes by, I didn‚Äôt hear anything. I emailed again asking if I am going to receive a reply. Another 8 days went by. Today I got an email that said in 2 sentences they don‚Äôt price match and I have to cancel and rebook to get the lower price. Problem is, because they took TWO weeks to reply I am paid in full and my cruise is too close to cancel without penalty. I emailed back and asked if I could have a supervisor contact me because I would have cancelled and rebooked if they didn‚Äôt take 2 weeks to reply. 

I have seen great reviews of MSC and some not-so-great ones. But, even if this cruise is paradise I truly don‚Äôt see myself booking with them again.

Now, as I finally go to book something and redeem the credit, they tell me I can't use it.  You can only use the credit if you pay ""full fare"".  No one ever pays ""full fare"".  There is always some promotion going on to make you think you are getting a great deal.  If I paid ""full fare"" and used my credit, it would cost me so much more money than booking without the credit.  It's a scam.  Total scam.  NCL should be ashamed.  They spend the entire week promoting this like it's the best thing ever, raising more money from raffle sales and even offer a last minute raffle sale, building the hype,  so you get in the drawing for the FREE CRUISE.  They drag out the number reading, like it's the power ball lottery.  Then, they hand the winner a piece of paper with a bunch of exclusions.  You can't go on these days or these ships.  It's got to be an inside room and a maximum of a 5-day cruise.  Blah, blah.  And, oh, you can't give it away.  And, oh, they can change the rules at any time.  So, one of the ships not listed on the piece of paper was a no-no.  They built the ship after the certificates were printed.  You can't go on one of the newer ships.  Doesn't matter what the paper says.  Also, you must redeem and sail within a year.  I ""won"" mine last September and I still can't find a legit cruise to redeem it on.  I'm so angry.  Next time I cruise, I'll give those damn raffle tickets to someone else.  I'm so angry, I told my husband I'll find some ""free"" cruise they will allow and book it just to block the room and I wouldn't actually go on the trip.  Oh no, you still have to pay fees and taxes on that free cruise.  So, now I guess I just frame my certificate and get absolutely nothing out of it.  It's such a scam.  I can't believe that NCL can find people to work for them to deal with the ""winners"" like me.  They must be ashamed of the lines they feed day in and day out.  All they do is say no all day.  Sorry, those are the rules.  Sorry, not that ship.  Sorry, not those dates.  Sorry, no........ 

If you've gotten this far, thanks for listening.  Free cruise, my a$$.  How is this not public knowledge?  I will never sit through that drawing again, hoping to be the lucky winner.

Cruise,"So, I don't know if this discount exists to begin with, when I booked with this person on the phone via Princess, he claimed that he would provide me a residence discount, as I live within the same state as the port (FL).

 He also claimed that this supposed discount would be BIGGER than a military discount (which is also something they do not offer anyways), and I can't stack discounts- fair enough, no problem.

I looked at the payment to book, I have yet to make a deposit on my booking, and I do not see any applied discount. I called Princess asking about this discount, I was put on hold a bunch of times and even hung up on before they made me go back to the initial person I booked within half an hour (i was trying to avoid him because he kept trying to give me to purchase things I did not want),

 I asked him about the residence discount, and he claimed that the discount was applied and insisted that because of my residence, the discount also applied to my guest. The price was the SAME as the initial cruise price (499) taxes/etc included, so despite how that made no sense to me, I basically didn't question it further. 

 Shortly after the phone call, I conducted a mock booking with the same exact cruise and date but used an address from a state that wasn't specific to Florida, the total was exactly the same. 

Can someone just answer the question as to whether or not this 'residence discount' even exists? I don't feel like wasting my time to dispute a discount that the agent claimed exists but didn't apply it.

I have been trying to book the restaurants through the princess app and it keeps trying to charge me $35pp for the reservation. I‚Äôve called now two times. The first agent told me that he would have to escalate it as he doesn‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs charging me and someone would call me back.

Once during disembarkation, the cruise director (who I had not met to this point) thanked me by first name for travelling with them.

Question is, does the cruise line review who has booked with them, and do they bring any passengers of interest to the attention of the crew?  

Or was this possibly related to me having booked an upgraded stateroom, and staff try to have awareness of these passengers.

Or does the cruise line monitor social media activity and make a note of positive passengers during the cruise?

Immediately, I searched the room for any other misplaced items and then handed them over to guest services. Thankfully, no harm was done, and we've had a great trip so far. However, I can't help but feel concerned. If the date on the prescription is accurate, it indicates a long period of inadequate room cleaning.

To their credit, Carnival did attempt to make amends. They performed a deep clean of our room and even provided us with chocolate-covered strawberries.

The idea of hours spent sitting on a balcony looking at beautiful scenery, drinking tea and reading a book with food and drink on tap seems idyllic and very relaxing. 

But I'm a quiet, introverted kind of of person and I'd be traveling solo.

   * \+ The ship looks awesome and is new, probably would also be less kids, cool ports even though it wasn't our original plan 
   * \- Considerably more expensive, not a fan of the infinite veranda idea, worried that some of these port visits will require quite a transfer to these bigger cities, many Italy ports which wasn't really on our list

Cruise,"Hey cruisers, was hoping to get some insight on how to manage getting to the port traveling by car.

I have done Disney in the past to the Manhattan port, used a Hotel with a Park and Cruise package, unfortunately the only hotels with that package are fully booked.

Plan is to travel day ahead and I would greatly appreciate other options. Right now I have:

1. Stay in Newark (cheaper hotels) drive to port and park there at $45/d x 7 nights
2. Stay in Newark park in some local lot (about $15-20 /d x 7 nights) then Uber both ways which looks like $80 x 2 so $160.

Any stay closer quickly doubles the hotel and parking rates but would save a little on Uber.

I would greatly appreciate ideas that I am unaware of, for example this is a MSC cruise, do they have shuttles from the Airports?

Cruise,"Hi everyone! I am looking to book a cruise for next month (I know it is last minute!) And I was hoping you all could give me some insight because I have not been on a cruise since I was 15.

Originally, I was planning to book a 5 night cruise with Royal Caribbean that stops in Cozumel and Coco Bay. I have been particularly interested in Cozumel, so this seemed perfect! Other than that, I planned to just enjoy lounging in the sun, reading, and exploring the food and entertainment on the boat.

Then, I read that Royal Caribbean is a much older crowd and it seems that many of the posts about young adults on cruises point to Carnival. Now, I am not a big drinker/partier, but I would explore the bars/nightlife a little and I definitely want to meet people around my age (say, around 40 and under?) since I will be alone. 

I looked into Carnival cruises from my desired port and there is one that is 4 nights. It stops in Nassau and Princess Cays. Personally, neither of these locations interest me that much. I have been to Nassau before and the animal excursions that would normally interest me seem rather unethical. So I would probably just sit on the beach or stay on the boat. Of course, the Carnival cruise is cheaper as well (by about $400) and I would save money on excursions. I am in school while working right now, so that makes financial constraints important (and limits my flexibility for timing).

So tell me... does the age/vibe difference or the price difference make it worth switching to Carnival? If the boats matter, I am looking at the RC Mariner &amp; Carnival Liberty.

He liked going even if he was often alone with the leader. He would play video games mostly. 

The entertainment was mostly bands playing covers. They were quite good. There was also comedy shows which my son and I loved. 

All in all we enjoyed it. Very different vibe from the Royal and Disney cruises we had done before!

Cruise,"  

**Check Fare Prices Often:** It is a very good idea to book early. Yet still check your pricing for your cruise often. If those prices go down, prior to final payment, you can leverage that to benefit you. Save money by rebooking, gain On-Board-Credits, and sometimes stateroom upgrades.

**Check Your Credit Card Cruise Perks:** Like anything you need to read the fine print. That said, I usually book a suite and get as much as $300.00 of on-board-credit and dinner for two at the French Restaurant when traveling on NCL. Other brands also have perks. I call this, free money. 

**Research the Pros/Cons of Who To Book With:** Every option has pros/cons. The number of debates online of what is best can become hostile at times. The best solution is learned about them all and make the decision that best suits you and your needs. I book with a very high cruise producer who also provides me with my American Express Platinum Cruise Perks. 

**Fly Into Port at Least A Day Early:** This is yet another point for debate. When you fly in the day before there is a cost for hotel. It might also cost a person a paid day at work to fly in early. I have done both. It only took one time of being so stressed that it effected my first two days on the ship, that I ALWAYS with no excuses come in the day before. I even do this when I can drive to the port if the drive is 3 hours or more. 

**Cruise Travel Insurance:** You only need life insurance for your family if you die. Since you cannot predict when that might happen, most families hedge their bets with life insurance. Cruise Travel Insurance also hedges your best of financial lost. For some like me, I need this coverage because my health insurances do not work outside the U.S. Like every product, you can get basic, medium, or high-end coverages. Take the time to read what each one does and choose what is best for you. When researching, please consider a Cruise Travel Insurance Company to do your research and comparisons. Remember, cruise brands are experts at cruises, not insurance. 

**Cruise Brand Provided Airfare:** This is usually a bargain or at least saves you some money. One piece of advice I gave above was book way in advance. This also allows you to book airfare on your own, even a fully refundable fare at the same or close to what the cruise brand is offering. You are in much more control with a decent refundable airfare then booking with the cruise brand. This is a huge topic on all cruise social media sites. My humble advice is book it yourself, select your own seats, select your connections, get all your airline points for the trip and in most cases, you can get the first piece of checked luggage free. 

**Reserve Your Specialty Dining Reservations Early:** If you have specialty dining on your next cruise, each brand has a date you can book those reservations. Mark that date on your calendar and get the reservations as early as you can. Use the cruise brands processes and procedures to your advantage. 

**Cruise Drink Programs:** Each brand has different policies for their Adult Drink Program. The mistake we all seem to want to make is justifying if we can drink enough to gain value from the program.  In the old days, you could buy a wine bottle package; that was it. At the end of the cruise, you would get your ‚ÄúDrink Bill‚Äù under the door. This happens to me only once. The bill was **HUGE**. Now most fares come with a drink package or a upgrade to a drink package. If you drink at all, consider it. If you don‚Äôt drink period, skip it. However always remember, you are on vacation. Doing ‚ÄúDrink Accounting‚Äù every day is not everyone‚Äôs idea of a good time. Yes, like a casino, a cruise brand will always make money on their drink package. 

**Check Your Stateroom Portfolio Daily:** Make this a habit because errors happen. Those portfolios are not the easiest things to follow if you only look at it the last day. Fixing it on that last day at Guest Services is also a hardship because everyone is doing the same thing at the same time. 

**Passports**: Your passport usually must be valid for 6 months after you last day of the cruise. Check your cruise brands rules. Passports take a while to gain or renew so please don‚Äôt wait to the last minute. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap that you can go on a cruise with only a certified original Birth Certificate. In many cases you can but the pitfalls can be huge. Get your valid passport early and be done with it.

**When To Board:** Again, an often-debated preference. I always follow the cruise brands rules to gain the earliest boarding time available as soon as I can get it. I want through security, in the terminal, sitting in front of the door that they let you board through even if I am sitting an hour or so early. Less stress for my family and me. Many say they prefer to board late, after the crowds are through. I can also see the benefit of that. Just not my approach.

**Day One Lunch:** Many go to the buffet which is fine if you are on the ship early. If not, the buffet can be crazy crowded. Go on to your favorite Cruise Social Media Site and ask the frequent cruise brand guests the best venue for that first lunch. All I am suggesting is have a plan. Remember, you carry on is with you initially because the staterooms are usually not ready until 01:30 PM.

**Stateroom For-Sale Items:** Have the room steward to butler take these items out of your room. The are expensive, sometimes old, and just the cruise lines way of making a few more dollars.  Recently, the crew put the items up in a closet in the stateroom rather than removing them. Each cruise line has different policies. These items have shown up on my stateroom portfolio when I did not use them. This is again why checking that portfolio daily is important. 

**Pre-Pay Gratuities:** If you intend to give your crew gratuities, just handle it upfront. One less thing to think about.  If you are in a suite with a Butler, that butler might not be part of the Pre-paid gratuities program. Know the rules and policies of your cruise brand. 

**Beware of Third Part Deals:** There are a lot of Discount High Volume internet cruise brokers. You see a fare less than the cruise line offers often by a big amount. Be very careful here. Look at the fine print and compare to what might be deleted from the other fares like with the cruise brand or a successful Cruise Agent. When things look to good to be true, they usually are. Do your due diligence and have peace of mind. 

**Read Reviews:** The best approach disregards the folks that say everything was perfect or everything was awful. You want a honest balanced review. The verbatim comments are incredibly important. One little hint. When you read post on a social media blog that focus on a specific brand, watch out the brand frequent cruisers. These folks tend to be very, very loyal to a brand. The can be harsh when anyone says something less than complementary about the brand. Remember what you want is real world realistic guest experience. Lots of them. 

**Avoid Holiday‚Äôs/Special Dates:** I used to cruise Thanksgiving week. I stopped and went the week after Thanksgiving. Less crowded, less money, more room in the pools/hot tubs, and easier to eat when you want. If it is a popular date for any reason, see if you can be just a little bit flexible with your dates. 

**Pain Killers:** Aspirin or Tylenol is NOT usually sold in the normal stores on the ship. I had to learn this the hard way. You can go to the ship hospital but that can be very expensive. 

**Social Media Does Not Create the Cruise Line Policies:** If you want accurate information about something really important, ask the cruise company. Many people as the question in a social media blog. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times the information was not correct and the guest paid the price. Some area‚Äôs are passport rules, drinking age, can I cruise when pregnant, can my friends not in the VIP Suite area come in, and the list goes on and on. My rule, if it is important, get your information from the source. Don‚Äôt be lazy.

**If You Gamble, Check with The Cruise Line Casino:**  I have gotten percentages off and free cruises.  Just takes a phone call.  

Hope I helped, add some thoughts of your own.

We have a weeklong cruise coming up soon. Unfortunately, for the last 9 months, my young, healthy, skinny, no medical history husband has had an as-of-yet unexplained illness that at one point landed him in the hospital for 5 days (acute respiratory failure) He‚Äôs been evaluated by countless specialists, had diagnostic procedures to try to find the cause, innumerable lab tests, but so far: no answers. 

He‚Äôs not contagious (negative for *countless* various pathogens) no fever, etc but he has intractable sinus congestion, and laryngitis because he coughs. Incessantly. 24/7 for the last NINE months. Refractory to every single medication and treatment known to man. 

He‚Äôs now being treated as if this is all a new autoimmune reaction, either related to his Covid vaccine or Covid illness a year ago.  But so far, still no relief. 

And while he doesn‚Äôt feel anywhere near 100%, he says he wants to still go.  Feels the salt air and water might help. But I can almost guarantee he‚Äôs going to get stares, comments and most likely, reported to the sick bay. 

I‚Äôm planning to bring copies of all his medical records, imaging discs, and a suitcase worth of medicine (poor guy goes through 1 bottle of Robitussin per day despite it barely making a difference).

A bunch of weird stuff that we are noticing and questions about the cruise and MSC can't help us on the phone.

Cruise,"
Sorry if this is basic but I‚Äôve scoured prior posts and got nothing. 

I booked a family NCL trip for five adults and four minors, into four rooms.  Three of those ‚Äúadults‚Äù are under 21 yo.  I made the bookings with a TA.  

Now that it‚Äôs time to check in, I just realized the rooms aren‚Äôt linked in any way.  I had to create a new login (email and password) for each room.  Then it wouldn‚Äôt let me put my credit card info for these other rooms (I guess it wanted a card with some one in the room‚Äôs name?).  And now looking at excursions, I would have to log into each account and book them by room (but I don‚Äôt know how many seats are left so don‚Äôt know if they could accommodate the whole group).  Worse, I bought the air from NCL (I know, I know‚Äînever again) and they booked us all as separate passengers so one of us has a different itinerary.

Is this really just how NCL does things? Should my TA have done something different so I could put all this under one account?  I‚Äôve done a few other cruises but never booked more than one room.  What a pain!

Cruise,"I came here a lot when we were planning and asked for some advice which I greatly appreciate! 

We just wrapped our 5 nights on Celebrity Summit. This was my first cruise, my partner‚Äôs second (first on celebrity). 

We chose Celebrity because of the food and reported atmosphere on board. It did not disappoint. 

We booked aqua class and I ate at Blu every single night for dinner. We had the premium drink package and greatly enjoyed the freedom to drink without worry of price and lived for the coffee at Cafe a Bacio. 

The buffet was good for lunch as I‚Äôm not a huge lunch eater and mostly got a few plates of snacks including hummus and pita, a slice of pizza, and nachos. 

The burger at the pool bar was yummy and hit the spot on a sea day. 

Overall, Blu was worth the upgrade to aqua class and generally enjoyed all my other options as well. 

The service was incredible. Every crew member we interacted with was kind and helpful. Our drinks were great and I appreciated the excitement and personality of everyone on board. The staff at Blu exceeded everyone else however. Truly cannot rave enough about that experience. 

I was worried about being bored but I got into the spirit and went to some game shows, music, and shows in the theater. I enjoyed the variety. Most were nothing to write home about but gave some variety to the day and mostly it was the other cruisers we interacted with that made the experience better. 

The ports were fine. I enjoyed our Cozumel excursion but I wasn‚Äôt impressed with Cozumel if that makes sense. Nassau was much better. VIP beach day at Blue Lagoon was amazing. 

Our bed was comfortable, plenty of spaces every day to relax, my massage in the spa was amazing, and I found myself enjoying a slower pace of life for a few days and really appreciating the work the crew put into our experience at every turn. 

10/10 recommend, would sail again but maybe skip Cozumel, definitely will always boom Aquaclass.

Cruise,"I am on the last 2 days of a 14 day cruise originating in Singapore, excited because this would be the Westerdam‚Äôs triumphant return to Asia.

Unfortunately, this trip has not been what my large group of 10 had hoped for, and we have heard from so many others that they also feel this cruise fell short on so many fronts.

For example, even embarkation at the start of the cruise was a mess. Many of us had 30+ travel time to make it to Singapore for the cruise. At no point did they inform us a COVID test was necessary‚Ä¶. Until 18 hours beforehand. It was not on any of the cruise documentation, the Navigator app, or VERIFLY. In fact, none of us knew until we waited 45 minutes in line, got to the front; then were told we had to find tests. 

There were dozens of others like us. Thankfully, they were able to provide tests, but it would‚Äôve been nice to have had that handled or know about the requirements before we showed up. After we texted, we had to get back in line and wait for another 45 minutes. Whether or not you had VERIFLY (which was supposed to expedite the process), you had to still wait in the same line.

On board, the experience with the housekeeping staff and dining staff were pleasant, but that‚Äôs about it. Guest services has been beyond abusive to anyone asking for help. They inform you via stateroom TV what is required at your next port of call, but the instructions are scant and if you have questions, god help you. You will be waiting in line for 25+ minutes only to be met with surly staff who do little more than tell you to figure it out. Given the average age on this ship is 65+ with few tech savvy people, this is disappointing.

The Westerdam staff also do not see it as their responsibility to inform their guests of procedures required until the very last minute. For example, we attended a port talk for Ishigaki where it was expressly said rbere were few taxis. The shore excursions were sold out. So, I purchased an independent tour for 10 people for the next day, leaving the ship at 9am. Given arrival was scheduled for 8 and giving us an hour to disembark, we figured this was plenty of time. Instead. We learned at 4pm the night before that immigration procedures would not BEGIN for our deck until 10:30am. 

The tour was non refundable. The time could not be modified. How could this happen? We were able to request priority oases but the procedures did not begin until 830. Meaning, we all missed our tour and lost out on $800. We never would have booked it if we had known. 

No entertainment on board except for some cut rate Backstreet Boys and an awful comedian. Nickel and diming for every little thing - shuttles at each port are overpriced at $25pp and don‚Äôt even take you to the central areas.

Cruise,"RC cruise planned for June '23. Birth certificate for child shows gender as female but reservation is made for male - Child's gender is male. Name, birthdate, everything else on the BC is accurate, only the gender is incorrect to our RC reservation. Reservation says male, BC says female. Wondering if RC and/or US Customs is goin to prevent us from boarding. 

And before we go down the path of ""WeLL yOu ShOuLd HaVe CoRReCtEd ThE BiRtH CeRTiFiCaTe"", let me explain where we're at. 

I separated from my son's mom several years ago. Getting a copy of his birth certificate was on my list of things to do, but never at the top. When we booked the cruise, I knew he would need his BC. I ordered it, it came, we're good. But the gender reads as female. I contact his mom, we notarize some papers and send them to the Department of Health. The processing time is 30 weeks. Best bet, I may get his amended BC by August in time for him to go back to school. 

I've called the Department of Health. They are currently processing orders that arrived in January. They do not have a process to expedite requests. The request isn't in the system yet. Their best bet, in April the request will hit the system. Until the request hits the system, nothing they can do. 

Looked into getting him an expedited passport using a BC his mom has. However because his BC is being amended, the only one we have on file is going to be invalid once the request hits the system, per the Department of Heath - haven't confirmed with Passport officials. 

Lastly, I called the US Customs office in the Port of Miami. The Customs Officer I spoke to said ""we only care the authenticity of US citizens, not their gender"". This sounds like wonderful news. My concern is getting that answer today and having a totally different experience once we get there. 

We have until April 5th to cancel. To summarize, our TA contacted RC who said to contact Customs and figure it out. US Customs is saying NBFD,  Department of Health says IDK LOL until sometime next month. Maybe a passport, if everything literally goes perfectly and timely. 

Anyone have experience dealing with this? Not really interested in opinions on gender and BC and as I was told by the Department of Health ""let an officer pull down my 7 year old's pants and see what happens"".

I‚Äôm single and the few friends who I‚Äôd enjoy traveling with have busy lives that likely wouldn‚Äôt let them come with me. I‚Äôd be happy if my mom came with, but she is unsure because she thinks Norway is going to be visually very similar to Alaska and it‚Äôs a long way to travel if it is (we are in the Midwest). This is aside from the obvious cultural difference there will be,  she is specifically thinking about the landscapes. 

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has done both an Alaskan and Norwegian Fjords cruise and their thoughts on this. 

I think I would still go regardless as I‚Äôm very independent and have always wanted to solo travel. 

Also, I‚Äôm considering going on MSC as their prices are fantastic compared to everyone else. Thoughts on that cruise line? I‚Äôm very introverted, so will likely keep to myself more than anything. I just want to relax, experience Norway, and eat some decent food.

Cruise,"Hey there all. I'm hoping to go on a cruise that includes Hawaii. Since I've only ever cruised NCL, PoA is where I'm gravitating toward first. I'd be really excited to do a week long cruise around the islands!  
The current price for a balcony for a single cruiser like me is \~$5K. This is a little bit more than I expected but I started thinking of it as a 'next year' cruise to save up for.  


Until today, when I checked prices again and saw that a 7 day cruise in just about 1 month from now is like HALF the price at around \~$2500. I was expecting this to be a 'sail away' only price that wouldn't include things I've come to expect on NCL (open bar) but was pleased to see that it is a normal balcony price, including the 'free at sea' perks...  


So, 1 month from now is a LITTLE sooner than I was planning on taking another vacation. I'm curious if this sort of thing might repeat in the future. Is it the case that possibly the '1 month from today' cruises of this ship will continue to be markedly cheaper like this one is now? I recognize that there are other factors tat play and nothing is guaranteed, but if I could push this cruise another 3-4 weeks and still get a good price like this it would be great!  


So, any of you have any idea why this week might be so cheap? If it's just because it's a '1 month from now and we're not sold out yet' price, could I expect this to continue for a few more weeks?

Reason being, I‚Äôve got to complete a Federal background check for employment purposes, and that includes disclosing all international travel outside the continental United States, specifying where I was and the dates I was there.

The problem is, Carnival doesn‚Äôt archive their itineraries beyond the name of the vessel, the sailing date, and basic customer service options in the event they deal with an upset cruiser.

Royal Caribbean has been helpful, they provided a basic itinerary, I just need to fill in the dates.  Our last cruise was just pre-Covid with Norwegian, so that one was easy enough to locate on our end.

Is there someone in this community that documents cruise sailings and destinations or anything like that, who may be able help me accurately find this information?  These cruises were in 2005, 2008 and 2011.

Cruise,"My sister and I recently started cruising and really enjoy it. It seems like many (most?) dedicated cruisers have a preferred line, but we decided to try different lines/ships until we decided we liked on or two significantly more.

So far, we've tried RCCL's Brilliance of the Seas, NCL's Getaway, Carnival Magic, and an upcoming trip on MSC Meraviglia.

We really liked the way Brilliance was laid out, it seemed like there were plenty of individual ""spaces"", not necessarily separate rooms, but areas that felt self contained. Getaway seemed to have more areas continually flowing into each other with little separation and we weren't as big of a fan. Food has been good on all 3 lines, though I personally loved having Guy's Burger and Blue Iguana Cantina. 

We normally sail out of Tampa or Orlando, but could get anywhere in Florida if we wanted. We're not huge ""party"" people or in need of a lot of nightlife, more preferring ""family friendly"" stuff like trivia and shows than bars and clubs.

Cruise,"Cursing in a couple months on a port heavy European cruise, didn‚Äôt spring for Haven because I wasn‚Äôt sure we‚Äôd take advantage of the perks being so port heavy. So then I was thinking the vibe beach club sounds right up our alley and honestly on a Caribbean itinerary I wouldn‚Äôt think twice‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm questioning if we‚Äôll take advantage enough to make the cost worth it.. just shy of 600 total for the 10 days.  

I had it in my head to try for the pass for the one sea day (probably like everyone else and their cousin) but now I‚Äôm wondering if we don‚Äôt just do it for the full time and make it a point to try and visit when we aren‚Äôt off the ship. We are 2 adults, mid thirties, no kids, don‚Äôt want to fight for a deck chair when/if we want one. We‚Äôre on the breakaway if that makes a difference! 

If you did the vibe, specifically on a European cruise I‚Äôd love your thoughts. Did you use pre/post shore excursions? Is it a place you could just go to hang out (would you want to?) what was the clientele like?  Did you feel crowded or was space available when you wanted it?

Some additional info:
- They are similar prices in the end (Holland has slightly cheaper balcony prices but more expensive excursions, so it evens out). 
- They both go to Glacier Bay National Park, which is on my bucket list! The main difference in the itinerary is that Holland goes to Sitka whereas Princess goes to Skagway.
- we have a few vegetarians and a few allergies to accommodate (I mention this because we've had bad experiences on Carnival cruises for this in the past).
- We are ages early 30s-60s, a mix of adventurer types and relaxation types when it comes to cruising (no partyers). We are excited about the whale watching and hiking/nature walk excursions!

Cruise,"Just had a not so great experience with booking through Royal Caribbean.  Family vacation is coming up and I booked two rooms through the RC website, checked boxes for connecting rooms, and got rates.  I took the guaranteed rate (the cheapest rate), meaning that they pick the rooms, not me.  I didn't care what deck we were on, why spend the extra money.  I just needed connecting rooms.

We received our boarding docs a few days ago and we did NOT get connecting rooms.  But here's the kicker, one room actually was a connecting room, it connects with a stranger's room, and the room next to the stranger is our second room.  So we're not connecting AND we're not adjacent AND we're not immediately across the hall from each other.  And there's just one room between us but they cannot simply swap our second room to make everything right because that room was selected by someone.

So.... called customer service, made my case, and the ship is full, there's no other options.  But sweet Gabrielle with customer service did point out ""well, you did get a connecting room for one room just like you requested...""  Right, connecting with a stranger... 

After talking it out with a supervisor and getting the same result, I went to plan B, can we adjust the rooms where my wife and I are in one room and our minor children are in the other room.... no, we cannot.  Because we are neither adjacent rooms nor rooms directly across the hallway...

This isn't going to ruin the vacation, but it's an idiotic frustration because we booked months ago and there were certainly connecting interiors available.

Cruise,"Hello all,

As you may have noticed there‚Äôs been an uptick in the number of lines offering long term cruises and live aboards.  Well they don‚Äôt get it. 
I travel a lot.  I was a captain for a cruise ship.  I would never want to go on a 6 month cruise and I would never want to be shackled to the ship.  What I would want is a line that offers me a condo onboard, but I can come and go as I please and on top of that I can rent out my unit when I‚Äôm not onboard to make a little passive income of my own.  I want to travel slow, meet and develop relationships with a mobile community, and still have the freedom to explore other options.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm building my own line to cater to a market that I think is ignored. Remote workers, perpetual travelers, and even families seeking lifestyle alternatives.  
You can buy a unit onboard and pay a monthly maintenance fee that can be covered by rentals when not onboard, you can stay for months in a unit that is being rented out by an owner, or you can stay in one of our ship owned units for however long you‚Äôd like.  You can cook your own meals onboard, bought from the onboard grocery store.  You can work without limitations, thanks to our amazing onboard (included) internet connection, and all the while you can explore the local flavor of wherever we happen to be moored. 
We offer a worldwide itinerary with port stays lasting at least three days.  No rushed runs through the local city to see the main sites.  Actual time to explore and get to know the areas we are passing through.

Cruise,"Trying to plan a vacation this summer for my husband and myself, we‚Äôve only been on one cruise for our honeymoon last year. It was a carnival cruise and we had a great time! The two options we‚Äôre looking at for this summer are: 1) Carnival cruise to Half Moon Cay, Grand Turk, and Amber Cove. Or 2) Royal Caribbean cruise to Cura√ßao, Aruba, and CocoCay. Both are 8 day itineraries. 

What we‚Äôre really hoping to get out of the trip is some relaxation time at beautiful beaches while enjoying drinks and snorkeling in blue waters. On our cruise last year our favorite day was going to Mr. Sanchos in Cozumel, so hoping to find a recreation of that day.

First I was leaning towards option 1 for the ports, but then we saw the ship would be pretty identical to last year and thought maybe we‚Äôd like option 2 to explore a new style of cruise ship. Option 2 is getting a little more expensive though, especially when looking into all inclusive day passes or other beach options at Aruba and Cura√ßao.

Cruise,"Wanted to share small moment of reflection. 

I‚Äôm currently at home going over some cruise blogger videos and thinking about some last minute shopping that needs to happen before our family cruise on 3/24. 

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have travelled a bit, not too much on cruises, mostly flights, trains, etc. This cruise will be my 6th cruise overall, and my husband, and son‚Äôs first. 

My parents escaped a dictatorship and they came to the USA in search of freedom and a better life. I am born and raised in Miami. Capital of cruise ships, right? Funny enough as a child my family couldn‚Äôt afford vacations. We were poor working class. We did go to Disney and theme parks once. Growing up my mother dreamed of traveling the world and getting to know other places, she often befriended tourists and sailors to get to know about their homelands as she couldn‚Äôt really escape her country. Mom passed that down to me, she fostered a love of getting to know the world beyond comfort zones. 

Anywho. Getting ready for the cruise. I thought back to when I was a kid in the 90s, the beach my family usually went to in Miami was South Pointe Park beach. It has always been in my opinion the most gorgeous beach in Miami. That‚Äôs the beach that when the cruise ships sail out of the port towards the open water you see a pier and the beach to the left of the ship. As a kid, often times we‚Äôd see ships leaving out to sea. I remember running to the pier or close to the pier and waving at all the passengers looking out from the cruise ships on the decks. Most of the times they‚Äôd wave back. I remember this fondly. It was always one of my favorite things to do at that beach. As a kid I thought, some day I want to be one of those people waving back at the little girl on the beach.  

I‚Äôm happy to report that every time I have cruise out of Miami I make it a thing, almost ritual like, to head out to the deck, make sure I see south pointe beach and wave at all the people there. I have cruised out of Europe and strangely enough, I didn‚Äôt do it when I sailed out of there. 

Anyway, just wanted to share. My son is too small to understand. I‚Äôll try to get him to wave though. Definitely making my husband wave.",Random Story -kind of-,,Insurance-Limp,,0,2023-03-04 20:02:45

I‚Äôve been looking at pricing on the website &amp; realizing for the veranda rooms it was only $300 more for a double occupancy than being there by myself (didn‚Äôt want to choose a solo cabin - they all had obstructed views &amp; I do plan on spending a fair bit of time in the cabin being an autistic adult who needs generous recharge time &amp; sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to be perceived by others lol) 

I might invite a friend or maybe my mother. Its so far in advance hard to say lol. Maybe a significant other! I wouldn‚Äôt mind going alone at all but it would just be really nice to have someone to chat with at dinners and such, go on an excursion together. 

My cruise goals; spa package + a few treatments, reading books, afternoon tea, enjoying the specialty restaurants, napping on a beach, meditation &amp; unplugging. ultra limited phone useage!

I have been super privileged to eat at Daniel in NYC so I was so excited to see Le Voyage By Daniel Boulud featured on the ship. Fine dining is definitely one of my favorite hobbies when I can fit it into a trip. 

After doing research on the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù packages and thinking about my own relationship with alcohol after having been sober for 6 months, I think alcohol wise Id have 1-2 pi√±a colada at the pool deck maybe 2-3 times on the sailing and a singular glass of wine for dinner, it didn‚Äôt seem like a good deal to choose the all inclusive deal because I don‚Äôt want wi-fi &amp; cannot see myself drinking tons of alcohol each day to make it worth it.

3. Porters. These are the people you hand your luggage to to bring on the boat? And they cost $5 per piece of luggage? Again when do you hand over the cash? When you hand them the luggage? 


4. Are there any more randos on this trip that I will have to hand cash to? Can someone please elaborate where I will meet them, what is their expected tip and at which point I hand them the cash?

Cruise,"Hello!

I'm looking to book a round trip Alaska cruise from Vancouver this September. 

It will be my Dad and I (he's 60, I'm 30). It would be the first cruise ever for the both of us. I've narrowed my choices down to two ships based on a couple mandatory things for us (roundtrip out of Vancouver, and we really want to see the inside passage). Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas, and Celebrity Eclipse.

Neither of us are drinkers or partiers, and I'm not really a watersports/swimming enthusiast. Both of us do want to have good food available, and be able to get some good views of the passage and glaciers. 

Between the two ships, I'm strongly leaning towards Celebrity since it seems more laid back (energy wise). I'm giving the dress code a bit of a side eye, but it's not a deal breaker. 

We are trying to keep things a little cheaper where possible and avoid spending money unnecessarily. I was thinking that we could skip on drinks packages (neither of us drink much alcohol, so probably just cheaper to buy the 1 or 2 beverages on their own?). I don't think we would need to worry about onboard wifi either, Telus seems to think we'd still get coverage (any other Canadians have experience with this? I don't fully believe them, hahaha)

Am I missing anything huge here? I've had a bit of information overload trying to do the research for this trip, and I'm paranoid that I've glossed over something major.

Also, any tips on Canadian sites or agencies to look at booking with?

1. Book 2 x connected rooms, one adult probably still have to sleep on the sofa bed, which I heard is rock hard.
2. Book a suite with 2 bedroom.  one of the bedroom has 2 x pullman bed so two older kids could sleep on the pullman beds.  

The suite is of course more expensive, I will do it if it's the only option.  Every time I try to check price of connected rooms it tells me there are no connected room available.

Cruise,"Many years ago I went on a ship which I believe was named Doric....or something like that.  It only had about 1,000 passengers....maybe even less.  It sailed from NYC to Bermuda.  Back then the ships would dock right in downtown Hamilton.  They were so much smaller then.  On the day of sailing friends arranged a sail away party for us.  They were allowed on the ship with us as we boarded.  We went to the pool deck.  They had little covered alcoves lining the pool.  Awaiting us was a full set up of food and drinks.  The party lasted about an hour.  And then there were announcements that all those NOT sailing had to leave the ship.  Just the thought of that happening today is incredible.  I also remember metal cabin keys.  No balconies .... just a porthole to look out in your cabin.  Dinner every night required people to dress up.

Cruise,"I have been on about 13 cruises. I have booked some on large online travel sites (expedia, [cruise.com](https://cruise.com), [cruises.com](https://cruises.com) etc) and also directly with the lines. In all of those cruises, I have reached out to a travel agent at least 4 times, each a different agent/agency, because I am constantly told by the waking world, that ""it should never be more expensive to book with a TA, they don't charge you, they can get discounts that you cant"" etc. etc. blah blah. 

Meanwhile, each time I have reached out to a TA about a particular cruise I am eyeballing, I receive a quote that is FAR above what I am able to find with a cursory search online whether it be with a travel site, or directly with the line. 

This week I checked a category of room, on a specific sailing, with 2 people, factoring in the only discount that cruise line offers via their online booking (past sailor 5% off) and nothing else. Price after port fees, without insurance, with past sailor discount applied $3386. I contacted a TA , since they can work with the cruise line to apply other discounts that are combinable with promotions and additional discounts, to have them get a price for the same room, same sailing, same everything and they came back claiming to have added additional discounts to the fare, with a number closer to 3800, without insurance, after taxes and fees. 

This has been my consistent experience with TA's. I also have noticed a trend of being ghosted after politely and respectfully letting them know that a better price is offered directly from the cruise line with less discounts ""applied"". No price breakdown, no explanation, sometimes even an indignant reply and shooing me away. 

Id love to talk to one of these TA's that live up to the lore of truly getting the best price, chasing down price reduction refunds, getting additional perks, etc.",Travel agents and pricing.,,Free_Rub1709,,0,2023-03-02 13:44:56

Most cruises I found that have a decent amount of ports are 14 nights and stop at only 4-5 ports. Are there not cruises leaving from Florida and ending in Mexico (or vice versa) that hit up all the islands along the way?

1: Is there any other fees or expenses we have to pay before getting on the ship or even off the ship? We don't plan on buying anything extra on board and afraid there will be more fees after ive already paid $2300 for the cruise

2: Anything we need to bring to get on the ship? Drivers license, birth certificate, passport, etc...?

3: is covid tests still required or needed to board before embarkation?

4: anything we should pack being on a cruise ship going to cozumel? My wife and i have never been out of the country (let alone our home state)

5: any other questions i should be asking that i haven't,  or tips to share with a newbie?

Cruise,"My parents are looking at a transatlantic cruise on Symphony of the Seas in October of this year from Barcelona to Fort Lauderdale. The ship looks spectacular, but they're concerned about a ship so large. They've been on mid size ships before with Holland America, Princess and Celebrity, but nothing this big. Since this cruise has 8 days straight without any ports is it going to feel absolutely packed? We've not been on RCI either or a ship this big so can't really advise them. Having done some research I imagine that this cruise, being 14 nights total will likely have more people like them on board (retirees) than kids and that being on a big ship is a good thing when you have so many at sea days.

Cruise,"I haven't traveled solo before but it's to a port I really want to go to. Flights home could be as cheap as $350 (at least this year in that month they are that cheap even though other months are more expensive, I can't see flights that late into next year though).

Inside cabin would be $1800, an ocean balcony would be $2500. I know everyone here is always balcony-or-bust but are there people who would recommend inside here? I really only want to spend time in my cabin sleeping, I'd be happy to stay up late outside on the deck.

Trying to convince someone to go with me so it can be $1400/person for a balcony but I'm thinking it may be more fun to try it solo, in which case the inside room makes the most sense financially. This is less about the view and more about the exciting solo travel on a budget.

I'm very tempted to book. Also looking into roulette strategies so I can pay off the cruise while I'm on the cruise, so really it'd be a wash (hoping the cruiseline sees this and offers me a discount expecting me to gamble a lot then I don't üíÖ)

I'd likely book airbnbs for a few nights since the cruise ends on a weekend and Wednesday/Thursday travel seems cheapest, and this adds to the appeal- getting to stay in the country for a few extra days and explore. I guess I'm worried about lugging a giant suitcase around while hanging out in a foreign country alone for a few days, I wish I could just backpack it.

The main reason why I think I'm crazy is that I've never been on a cruise before. But I really want to. And it seems like the perfect ship to the perfect destination, and the perfect time for me to travel. I might try to book a quick cheap weekend one to get a feel for cruises between now and then but I want to get the room before prices go up.

My beloved Carnival Sunshine will be leaving Charleston, SC at the end of 2024 which is soul-crushing. I LOVE that ship because it has an amazing thermal suite with free access if you book a serenity room. 

The thermal suite has indoor ceramic heated loungers looking out over the ocean and 3 saunas. Everytime I book this ship, I hang out on a ceramic lounger, away from the noise. Being a Carnival ship, not many people take advantage of the serenity spa so I can always get a heated lounger and hang out with my son. It's a nice, cheap vacation as I drive to the port from Atlanta (my home). 

Can anyone recommend another ship/port that offers a similar experience that is close to Atlanta? I tried checking out Tampa Bay and Mobile, but it doesn't look like those Carnival ships offer the same amenities.

Cruise,"My wife and I are in our early 30s and looking for a Northern European itinerary to celebrate our 10th anniversary. It will be my 3rd cruise (but it's been a while: Princess in 2006, NCL in in 2011), and my wife's first. 

The things that are important to us are: 

* ITINERARY. We would love larger historical port cities to enjoy (Copenhagen and Stockholm are must-haves, and Helsinki/Oslo/Amsterdam/Berlin all would be ideal as well). 
* FOOD QUALITY. If we're eating dinner on the ship we want it to be fantastic and to reflect the local specialties. 
* A sense of pampering/luxury. 
* No/minimal kids. 

Not particularly important to us: 

* SOCIAL ASPECT. We mostly will want to keep to ourselves. 
* BUSTLING NIGHTLIFE. Our ideal evening is drinks alone in a nice quiet space, maybe in a hot tub, maybe on a deck. We might go to a show or two if it was offered - but this is not something we need.   


The specific trips we are looking at are: 

Viking's [Viking Homelands](https://www.vikingcruises.com/oceans/cruise-destinations/baltic/viking-homelands/index.html)  
From what I can tell this would really tick all our boxes and then some - but at 15 nights it's a little longer than ideal for us - which is probably 14 days including travel on either end. 

Oceania's [Paris to Stockholm](https://www.oceaniacruises.com/baltic-cruises/paris-to-stockholm-NAU240713/?sr=%2Fcruise-finder%23marketing_region%3Dbalticandscandinavia%26time_frame%3D2024-3%7C2024-4%7C2024-5%7C2024-6%7C2024-7%7C2024-8%7C2024-9%7C2024-10%7C2024%7C2025-4%7C2025-5%26sort%3Dfeatured%3Adesc%26page%3D1%26pageSize%3D10)

We love the look of this one and are strongly leaning in this direction. Our only hesitation is that their target market is quite a bit older than we are - so when I read ""best food"" does that mean it's an octogenarian's idea of ""best food"" - or will we like it too? Will dinner be too early? Will cocktail bars close too early? etc. 

Azamara's [Northern Cities](https://www.azamara.com/voyage/pr12u366/12-night-northern-cities-voyage)

This is a pretty nice looking trip as well. I just haven't seen or heard as much about Azamara and am not sure how to think about them relative to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there other lines/itineraries we should be considering? I've heard good things about Seabourn and Virgin Voyages but was unimpressed by their itineraries in this region. Should we go with our first instinct and book Oceania or are we too young?

She was told this is a huge deal, and they would be charged $200 a person to remedy it. Said agent stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this job for 20 years, I know I asked you for your middle names‚Äù but‚Äî if she had asked why would my sister have not given them? She obviously knows the middle names of her immediate family. Also‚Äî NONE of the rest of us have our middle names on our documents for NCL (Which makes it glaringly obvious that she didn‚Äôt ask/specify because how are there 19 of the rest of us who also don‚Äôt have them listed) *side note:* we are using their flight package and shuttle service, which I am seeing can also be a headache

Question being, is this as huge of a deal and she‚Äôs making it, or are they just looking for money? If it‚Äôs only because of our flight package‚Äî TSA doesn‚Äôt care about middle names when flying domestically.

Cruise,"We just got off our first Virgin cruise yesterday, and I wanted to give my review for anyone else who‚Äôs on the fence like I was. We did a 6 night cruise to Costa Maya, Roatan, and Bimini. For this review I‚Äôll focus on the food. I‚Äôll post another about the cruise itself later.

First off let me start with a disclaimer and warning. We stayed in Miami the night of the trip and used points to book a room so we decided to splurge for dinner. We went to a restaurant that had live king crab and cooked it fresh, we also got a Kobe filet to share. This was the most expensive meal of my life but by far the best. The downside of this was going from this level of food to cruise food was a major downgrade. Nothing Virgin offered or really any major cruise offered could have come close to that meal. So my recommendation is do not go to an amazingÔøº restaurant before you start your cruise you will let down by everything on board. With that said I will start my breaking down the dining from best to worst. Forgive me if I don‚Äôt get the name of all the places right. 

The galley: it‚Äôs not a buffet thank God. They have some quick bites you can get a plate of quickly but everything else is ordered off of a menu and brought to you buy a server. The deserts and pastries were amazing, the tacos and ramen were also incredible as well as the fries from the burger place. Breakfast there was really good as well. Overall the food here was really good, I would have loved an Indian option, but it was good. The sushi was okay, not great. 

The pizza place: the pizza was really good and made to order so it always came out piping hot and fresh. I wish they had more topping options.

Extra Virgin: this is the Italian place and it was delicious, I highly recommend going. 

Wake: this is the steakhouse and it was okay, steak wasn‚Äôt bad, about the same and chops on royal but you can get a far better steak on land. 

Korean BBQ: this place was decent food wasn‚Äôt bad but the atmosphere was fun and I recommend going for that reason. 

Pink agave: this was this Mexican place, it wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt great, you could skip it and be fine. 

Razzle dazzle: wasn‚Äôt very good. Fried chicken was good but that was bout it. 

Test kitchen: horrible, the menu changes every night but I didn‚Äôt meet one person that actually liked it. Skip. Wonderland on royal blows this out of the water and shows how this concept should be done right. 

Room service: it was okay, but very limited options food wise.  

Overall the food on Virgin was good and we liked the concept of breaking up the crowd to several different food venues across the ship, it really makes for a better cruise experience. One thing we did not like as a couple was the small table sizes and being seated right on top of other people. I know it‚Äôs a ship but we did not like feeling crammed into to small tables right beside other people like sardines each night. Royal did a much better job of this. With that said we did like most of the food on Virgin, but I would recommend just sticking to the regular dining most nights and spend more time enjoying your trip than spending 1.5 hours in a mediocre speciality dining venue when you could have gotten something just as tasty in the galley. Just book the best places and skip the rest and enjoy your trip.",Review of my recent Virgin cruise Food version,,allvoltrey,,0,2023-02-26 22:56:49

My impression is that this industry is so predatory and outdated. The whole system of booking, gives major boomer vibes. The way the websites are set up are not transparent on its prices.

Cruise,"So my family and I recently cruised with Royal Caribbean out of Galveston, TX on the *Allure of the Seas* on a 8 day cruise with ports in Honduras and Mexico. 

We had an absolute blast. We would really like to plan another cruise, but with our only experience being with RC, I was curious as to how RC stacks up to other cruise lines. I figured the best way to do this is to give my initial thoughts on different things and hopefully people can give me some opinions and experiences against my own for comparison.

The boarding process at the cruise terminal was really my only gripe about the entire experience. We sailed out of Galveston, and it was a bit nightmarish of a process as first time cruisers. Maybe this will get easier as we become more experienced, but the terminal was crowded, with no real organization. We had no idea how to check in (we found out later we could do this via the app pre-boarding) and were bounced around lines before finally being helped at a randomly placed desk in the middle of the room.

Once onboard, our safety check-in was a breeze and we were almost immediately able to check into our room. 

The room, considering my expectations, was decently spacious. We had an ocean view stateroom on the third deck. It was quiet, and there was never a night where we had issues with noise. Staff were exceptional and went above and beyond to take care of us during our stay. If we would go out, we would almost always come back to folded clothes, clean towels (and towel animals!) and room. 

We mostly dined at the Windjammer, with the exception of a lunch or two at Wipe Out and Sorrentos. I found the food to be of exceptional quality, and while breakfast and lunch were fairly similar menus day-to-day, it was all delicious. Dinner themes would change, but again, all delicious. We did do main dining one night, and it blew us away. All the free food options we had on the ship were fantastic and I felt this was one of the highlights of the cruise.

The other highlight of the cruise for us was the entertainment. We didn‚Äôt do the Casino, however we did get to see almost every show or act they had onboard sans a few of the late night comedy shows. The Amber Theater was mind blowing and the production was all top of the line. Mamma Mia, while not on par with Broadway, was definitely a high level, high quality production. My wife loved the comedy shows and even I found myself laughing not being the biggest fan of standup. The Aquatheater was a huge surprise. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but it was on par with most shows you could see in Vegas. The high-tech stage was cool and again, production was top-notch. Studio B had an ice rink, and while we didn‚Äôt get to ice skate, we did see the ice show which again, did not disappoint.

The only area I felt was lacking a bit was in the kid department. Now, admittedly our daughter is shy and she did really like the whirlpool, but she didn‚Äôt really get much from the Adventure Ocean program. She‚Äôs 9, so she‚Äôs at a weird age where they‚Äôre not quite independent yet, and she was one of the younger kids being in the 9-11 age group. They had a really cool looking science lab my daughter was excited about, but the science activities are only done IF there is enough interest from the group and so she never had the opportunity to use it. The Allure didn‚Äôt have any of the slides or some of the other features I‚Äôve seen on other RC ships, so I‚Äôd be curious as to how they stack up to even some of the other ships in the RC fleet. 

Anyways, anyone with experience with other ships in the RC fleet, or other cruise lines entirely (Norwegian, Carnival, MSC, Disney, etc), how does RC and the Allure stack up in terms of cruise experiences versus cost? TIA!",2nd Cruise Advice,,Talkamania,,0,2023-02-25 22:04:00

Cruise,"Hi all! Thank you so much for helping me decide my Alaska cruise provider! I'm booked and ready to go on the Sapphire Princess April 29th. I'm so excited!

I'm a big over planner and early retired a year into covid so I've had the time and inclination to watch the YouTube videos, read the articles, and track the ship's itinerary between now and then. My intention is to plan it and forget it until it's time to do my 45, 30, and 15-day tasks. And then rejig everything when the onboard details are posted or I get my first Patter and just go with it.

And now I have questions Google can't or won't answer. Sapphire is doing a repositioning cruise April 6-12 and then has nothing scheduled until April 29. According to an old cruise critic (I think) post, she was scheduled for drydock in Portland April 12-May 1, but obviously that has changed. She also seems to have not been actively sailing until September '22 for various reasons.

The questions...
... if she is in drydock, what would they possibly want to do since she's only been active again for 9ish months? Is this normal because she needs to run a different fuel system in Alaska?
... if she's not debarking passengers on April 29, does that mean I can access my stateroom upon boarding instead of waiting? Can I assume nobody but my cabin attendant has been in the stateroom for weeks and therefore not sanitize every surface and air out the room when I arrive? I probably will anyway as I'm a low-level germaphobe so taking a cruise at all wasn't even on my radar until I New Years Resolved myself into pushing my limits in 2023. So yeah, never cruised, never traveled alone, and now this. Limits? What limits? Lol
... she's doing what seems to be an odd, or non-typical route north with ocean sailing for two days up to hubbard glacier that no other itineraries seem to do and the spa isn't booking anything for those 2 days. Is she blowing out the cobwebs? Or testing the different fuel system she needs for Alaska waters? Or other? It almost seems as though she is doing the typical inside passage route in reverse.

Thanks all!! Yes, I know I'm overthinking. 

TL;DR
Sapphire Princess appears to have no cruises scheduled for 18 days prior to my sailing and is spending her first two days at sea traveling north to Hubbard Glacier.

***

My logic - 

If we upgraded to free at sea plus ($343 each), we would get 

premium plus beverages (only useful for me)

$200 extra excursion credit

unlimited wifi for both of us (I absolutely need to have unlimited so I can call my kids as much as I want/they want, she is less concerned about having it, but it would be nice) ($110pp not in the package)

2 extra specialty dining (this would be nice, though my sister is a vegetarian so that limits things, plus we will be in the Haven so we already can eat there

***

So for the free at sea plus it would be $686, but if we subtract the $200 excursion credit, and the $110 I'd be paying for unlimited internet, we would basically be paying $376 for

premium plus drinks for me
unlimited wifi for her (which would be nice, but not necessary)

Cruise,"Hello everyone! Apologies if this is something that gets asked a lot. My wife and are taking our first cruise (I have been on before but it was over 10 years with my parents as a teenager) this summer in June, a 5-night cruise from Charleston to the Bahamas. Based on some posts I‚Äôve seen here it looks like Half Moon Cay is a good place just to sit around on the beach and relax. But for the first stop in Nassau, I am wondering if it‚Äôs worth finding some things to do. 

We had looked at some excursions through carnival, but they all seem kind of‚Ä¶ eh. Everything seems crowded, rushed, and not really worth doing. For example like ‚Äòswimming with the sea turtles‚Äô but the reviews make it seem like you ride over, look at them, and then you‚Äôre done. 

We had looked at renting the private cabanas over in pearl island. It‚Äôs all booked through carnival but I did find availability on a site called Viator. The reviews seem good and it looks legit, but has anyone ever used them before? 

And as a broader question, my wife is really worried if we book anything outside of carnival we might not make it back to the ship in time. Anyone had issues with this using 3rd parties? 

I guess really what I want to know is 1. Are shore excursions worth it 2. If so, is it okay to use a 3rd party or should we stick with carnival?

Cruise,"Husband and I went on a Celebrity cruise last year and it was wonderful. We sailed on the Apex and went with a Sky Suite in the Retreat. We are in our late 20s, no kids and it was our first experience cruising. We loved the ship, the restaurants, the Retreat sundeck and the service was excellent.

 We're not big partiers and kind of enjoyed the quietness of the experience. For context we were docked near a Carnival cruise one day at port that was blasting music all day and I was glad that I was not on that ship. I instead much preferred the shows and performances every evening and doing excursions during the day. 

Anyway, this year we would also like to go on a cruise and we were considering NCL (the Haven). Looking at the reviews of the ships, I think I prefer Celebrity, but I would like to consider trying something different.

After comparing all options, I found a really good deal on RCL Australia and booked it straight away, paid the amount specified in full. 

Shortly after looking at the confirmation page, I realized that I put a wrong month for my sons bday and called the support line straight away to fix it. While chatting with the support specialist, among all she asked whether I‚Äôd like to pay an outstanding balance of slightly more than a hundred dollars. She also said that if I don‚Äôt pay my booking will be automatically canceled and I‚Äôd receive a refund according to their refund policy which at a time would already be less than full amount. So I challenged that for a bit trying to understand where the amount came from but she had no clue saying that in her system the booking was created at that amount and she can not wave it or give on board credit, so it was either pay or loose more money and the booking itself. 

I paid as it wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal but wtf? I still can‚Äôt get them to answer where the outstanding balance came from, and what bothers me the most is that my booking would‚Äôve been cancelled without me even knowing it if I wouldn‚Äôt have called. Their email support been next to useless.

We plan to be off the boat as soon as possible and and not returned until an hour ish before departure.

We're Canadian so we're looking at 7-night itineraries with Vancouver departure/return. Parents are late 70s/early 80s so this is a bucket list item for them. None of us have ever been on a cruise before. 

Right now, we're looking at Royal Caribbean's 7-night multi-glacier experience itinerary on the Brilliance of the Seas. It includes Sitka, Tracy Arm Fjord, Juneau, Hubbard Glacier, and Ketchikan. One of my parents is very active, but the other has mobility issues and is not keen on going on many shore excursions. We thought this itinerary might be good since it seems there will be plenty of time on the ship, and we have no idea how wheelchair accessible places like Sitka, Juneau or Ketchikan are. We are planning on booking an accessible balcony room for our parents so that they can enjoy the view even if one of them declines to go onshore. 

I've read through a bunch of posts in this subreddit that Glacier Bay is a must-see, but I've checked another cruise line and it seems that there's limited availability during the time we'd like to go. I've also been told that Royal Caribbean is more family-friendly than some other cruise lines. 

I'm just hoping to get some advice for planning a great multi-generational family cruise to Alaska, especially when one of the older family members has mobility issues.

**Who:** Me (20sF),  DH (30s), DS (14mo), DD (2.5yr, turned 3yr during the trip), my parents/kids Gma &amp; Gpa (50s).


**What:** 9 day cruise with Norwegian (NCL), + 1 day in Panam√° before and after, so 11 days total.


**When:** Feb 2023


**Where:** Colon Panam√°  / Cartagena, Columbia / Cura√ßao / Aruba / Bonaire / Limon, Costa Rica / Panam√° Canal 


**Food/Meals:** We ate most of our meals in the Garden Cafe / free buffet area. It was easiest with the kids.  We also ate in OSheehans (pub food) a few times because it was less busy.

Gma and Gpa graciously took DD and DS one night so we could eat at Cagneys Steakhouse. It was on par with other big city steakhouses. A wonderful meal. 

DD(F, 2-3yr) was often bored at meals and would get into mischief (dumping piles of salt, playing with the window shades and sugar packets, couldn‚Äôt sit still, etc). We used the iPad at a few meals and that helped. She was honestly pretty well behaved, all things considered. 

DS(M, 14mo) was a rascal at meals. Food could never come fast enough, or if it came too early he was done before us and then bored. He could not be entertained via iPad. He was‚Ä¶ a 1yr old lol. He behaved as one would expect, which unfortunately wasn‚Äôt super enjoyable lol. 


**Sleep/Naps:** We had a small ocean view room, 8th level, aft/back of ship.  


Our bed was 2 twins pushed together, very comfortable.  DD (F, 2-3yr) was on a bunk bed which folded down from the wall. She thought that was soooo cool.  DS (M, 14mos) was below her on a floor bed.


The floor bed arrangement was new for us (we use a standard crib at home). Luckily he was so tired every day, he would fall asleep snuggling one of us, and we‚Äôd transfer him to the floor bed. The first night we had a few ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused‚Äù wake ups, but the rest of the trip was basically flawless. 


Curtains close and sorta lapse over the other, so it got nice and dark! We also brought a portable sound machine, which was REALLY nice for all of us. We never were bothered by people walking the halls near O‚ÄôSheehans (the 24/7 pub). 


Naps happened mostly on the go in the stroller,  or on my lap during a few excursions which involved bus/train/boat.  During the 2 At Sea days, DH stayed in the room with DS during nap time, while I took DD to the pool.


**Getting around / What to bring and buy:**

*These are only my opinions.*


‚ÄîMaybe skip: We brought the baby carrier and never used it except through the airport‚Ä¶ 


‚ÄîDef bring:  We also brought a small, collapsible side by side double stroller (on Amazon - Delta Childrens LX or something.. $100ish).  This was mostly fantastic‚Ä¶ Lots of pockets, easy fold, navigates well for excursions, etc‚Ä¶ 

but 3 complaints:  

1- even being a slim side by side, it was too wide for the skinny cruise ship hall ways if another person were in the hall, or a vacuum or something‚Ä¶ 

2- I wish it had a larger umbrella‚Ä¶ 

3- I wish it leaned back more.    


If you only have 1 little, I saw someone with a GREAT Safety1st brand stroller, and they tend to be a budget friendly brand so I looked it up: *Safety 1st Step Lite Compact Stroller. Great umbrella and great recline. $99*


‚ÄîDef bring:  Brita water filtering water bottle:  I left mine at home in favor of my larger, more durable Stanley flip straw bottle‚Ä¶ but so wish I‚Äôd brought it. The water where we were is safe to drink, but it did taste a little off‚Ä¶ as is always the case when we leave home lol. 


‚ÄîSkip it: Leave the power strip at home. On the Norwegian Jewel, our oceanview room had 3 regular outlets, and 4 USB outlets. Skip the power strip. This was plenty for iPads and iPhones. 


‚ÄîSkip it:  Lanyards. My stepmom said we‚Äôd need lanyards for our keycards which you need for drinks, some meals, and room access. I always stuck mine in my pocket, fannypack, or my husbands wallet. 


‚ÄîBring:  5s and 1s for tips for your excursion/tour guides, and baggage handling folks, as well as on shore snacks, souvenirs, etc. 


‚ÄîBring:  Phone or iPad with DOWNLOADED content. Wifi wasn‚Äôt great on the ship for us, and pricey. 


‚ÄîBring:  Suckers/lollipops on the flight. It will help with their ears during landing. We couldn‚Äôt find them at the airport, so do buy ahead of time. 



**Misc notes:**

‚ÄîBabies in the pool. Rules say ‚Äúno diapers/swim diapers in the pool. No babies in the pool. ‚Äú Let me tell you‚Ä¶ there were hella babies in the pool in diapers and swim diapers. So. Do you. 


‚ÄîOur ship (Norwegian Jewel) had an area behind the pool bar/ping pong tables for tots age 6mo-3yr with toys that were sanitized and rotated daily. It was a freakin lifesaver. Our kids loved playing in there. Parents stay. It‚Äôs not a drop off area.  There was no window though, so that was a small bummer. 


‚ÄîStaff loooooved our baby/young toddler.  They were so kind. They didn‚Äôt interact with our older toddler as much, which sorta broke my heart bc you could tell she was sad like ‚ÄúHey what about me?‚Äù when they‚Äôd play Peek A Boo with the baby. It‚Äôs fine, just a thing we noticed. 


‚ÄîWe always made a point to clean up the floor after meals out of respect for the next guest. The staff would always always stop us and say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on vacation, we do this.‚Äù  They always offered to help carry our buffet food back to a table for us, or get us a highchair, etc. They were very very accommodating. 


‚ÄîWe had a coupon on our door for $29 bag of laundry midway through the cruise. 10/10 experience. It was worth every penny. We had our airport outfits (winter clothing) washed, fresh undies for DD (who occasionally drips on her way to the potty), and fresh outfits for DS who is a very messy eater. 


**Would we do it again?:**

‚ÄîI **WOULD/WILL** cruise with Norwegian again. It was a lovely experience. We already purchased deposits for our next cruise with them!! I think we will do Alaska, but we will see.


‚ÄîI **would NOT** recommend cruising/vacationing at length with a 14mo old lol. DD really enjoyed herself at age 2.5-3yr. DS at 14mo was just mad he couldn‚Äôt run where ever he wanted at all times. He just wanted to play and run.

Cruise,"I found out today that Princess no longer offers a soda package.  The information is still on their website but if you go to the cruise personalizer the only non-alchoholic package is the Stateroom Canned Soda Package.  With this package they deliver a 6 pack of soda to your stateroom.  You can mix and match sodas but still it is pretty lame that you can't purchase a package just get a soda where you are at on the ship.  You are still allowed to carry on a 12 pack of soda per person so unless you are going to drink a serious amount of soda during your cruise I have no idea why you would pay for this package.  On my cruise there is only this odd 6 pack of soda package, a bottled water package and then 2 alcohol packages that start at $75 a day.

We make sure to stay in the same cabin for both ""legs"" of our back to back cruise (not just for this trick but that way we can unpack and not stress outside of having to disembark momentarily for customs)

The day before the first cruise ends, we go and buy duty free alcohol on the ship. This is the only day cruisers can take it back to the room, as it technically the last day of the current cruise. Because we are staying on, we now have a reasonably inexpensive bottle of liquor or 2  for early mornings or late nights where we don't want to have to run to a bar.

The price is very low and we love that. We have to consider budget before anything and MSC is checking all of the boxes for a 7 days cruise that Royal is not. We are not super picky on ports. This cruise is more for the kids and to relax on the ship, as long as the ports have beaches we are fine with that. Meraviglia has a ton of kid friendly activities that are really drawing me in and we could leave out of New York. We live in Pennsylvania and a drivable port is a huge plus for the budget.

They are actually flying in and out of Stockholm from the US because they have friends in Sweden they are visiting for a few days ahead of the cruise.

The cruise is scheduled to arrive back in Athens at the end of the trip at 6am on the last day. They need to fly to Stockholm sometime that day (from Athens) to catch their flight back to the US the following day. I'm working on booking the Stockholm to Athens round trip flights now. I've never been on a cruise and neither has my daughter, so how much time should we allow the morning the cruise disembarks (allegedly around 6am) to get to the airport without being frantic and worrying about missing flights?

Cruise,"My two cents on this cruise for anyone looking to cruise NCL or the Breakaway in the near future.

This is my 3rd cruise on NCL, solo female, early 40's

Positives:

* Embarkation had a long line, but it went quickly and I walked right on the ship afterwards. Probably 1 hour total.
* Main dining room food was really good, more variety than previous cruise. Plenty of staff on floor and very friendly.
* Le Bistro - great food, friendly staff. Went twice.
* Main shows: Six and Burn the Floor. Top talent. I'm not a fan of musicals, but it was good for what it was.
* Shore Excursions - booked 4 with NCL because of the $50 credit. Three were well organized, and all of them had professional and friendly guides.
* Overall, all staff I dealt with were super friendly and happy to help if needed.
* Water slides were fun and not busy.
* The waterfront area (Deck 8) is nice both day and night, with not too many people and fairly quiet, comfortable seating for reading or just relaxing.
* O'Sheehan's was good. Food was great and although there was a wait every time, it wasn't as long as they anticipated. Most I had to wait was 15 minutes.
* All food venues had buzzers you could get for waiting for a seat to open. Thought this was great. I could grab a drink in the meantime and be seated soon after.
* Shakers bar staff were great and quicker than most other bars.
* I loved Harvest Caye (private island), mostly because of the pool. I didn't eat or drink anything and just went back on the ship for an hour for lunch. Seemed like lot's of people were drinking though and the food looked good.
* I enjoyed the excursions at the other cruise ports (Costa Maya, Cozumel and Roatan) but didn't like the Costa Maya port (way too crowded and hard to navigate) and would probably avoid on a future cruise.

Negatives:

* Disembarkation was a bit hectic and long
* Can't comment on the food in the buffet, I only ate there once and it was a salad. The crowds were huge all the time and I wanted to avoid it.
* La Cucina (specialty dining) had poor service and food. I think one person was still in training. They were friendly, but seemed overwhelmed and were not attentive (as in would need to be called over for everything and wait times were long). Food was okay but nothing special. What I disliked the most was that a lot of food was wasted. Food portions were very big and they wouldn't allow take away. I saw a few tables leave with over half the meals uneaten.
* Bar service was lacking, mostly because there were very few bar staff at all the bars. They also seemed less than friendly/happy, but I don't blame them.
* I normally only get my room cleaned every second day and would normally only get the service done once a day, so the reduced service didn't bother me. However, they wouldn't have it done until 4pm, so most days I didn't bother.
* Pool area and deck was super busy, but I usually avoid this part of the ship anyway.
* Solo meeting was pretty much non-existent. It was held in Spice H20, so there was no dedicated space or bar. Most people didn't show up after the first day, and therefore limited dinners together and getting to know other solos.
* The excursions booked at Harvest Caye were very disorganized at the Marina. But once on the boat, staff were great.
* Activities on the ship weren't that interesting, and the few that were of interested were crowded. The Atrium (where a lot were held) was packed all the time.

Overall it was a good cruise. I preferred the previous ones (on Epic). The downfalls of this one were the crowds for everything (ship was completely booked) and lack of staff to deal with everyone. I likely won't cruise on NCL again anytime in the near future and will likely try out another cruise line. Also will likely try a smaller ship.",NCL Breakaway Feb 5 Trip Review,,confusedin2020,,0,2023-02-19 17:51:13

I've read a lot of people saying to do Disney if it's your first time (and is very nice, albeit overpriced), and will be great for the younger kids but not sure if there will be enough to do for the older ones.. and not sure if Disney warrants the premium (half our group loves Disney though, and visit 1-2x a year).   But, we keep reading/hearing how great Disney cruises are. 

We've also heard Royal Caribbean is great for families, but are concerned with how large the ship is and whether there will be enough for the younger crowd.   But you get so much more for your money, space-wise at least!  Lots of people say to combine and get best of both worlds by doing RC cruise, then a few days at the Disney parks so that's a consideration. 

TL:DR Guess my question is, Disney Wish or RC Allure of the Sea for first-timer family cruise?

Cruise,"Hello!  I thought I'd come to some experts here on reddit before shelling out money for a travel agent who might find some of my questions stupid.  I've never been on a cruise before but have always wanted to.  Now my friends and I are going to have schedules that line up to have a holiday at the same time.  I'm just....not sure where to book or what to do since I don't have any experience.

Our busiest friend has the days off of August 4th 2023 through August 13th 2023 and we can all plan around that.  Also all of us would like somewhere in the Carribean/Mexico/Bahamas area of the world when it comes to destinations.  4/5 days is the perfect length for us.

We're a little bit frugal so we can't go on any of the higher end cruise lines but we don't need a super budget cruise either.  Preferably we can just wait until one of the cruise lines is having a big sale and book then.  We don't mind an interior room but an ocean view would be nice since three of us have never cruised before and one of us has only done Disney with family.

As far as experiences go, some of us really want some fun things to do aboard the ship like entertainment and maybe some classes to take, a good pool etc.  Some of us really want some fun excursions to do when we're at port.  So a mix of those two is good.  We're all in our mid twenties to early thirties and want to let loose but we're also not big partiers.  (Karaoke is a must though)

So yeah any tips you might have for which cruise lines you think would be the best to look at or tips for getting a good deal on a cruise would be appreciated.",Cruise Advice - This Would Be My First Cruise,,aceavengers,,0,2023-02-18 15:44:31

Cruise,"Hi,

I'm heading off on my first cruise and trying to work out the various packages.  My wife and I are not big alcohol drinkers or consumers of cold soft drinks.

**Alcoholic drink **

Can any one tell me the cost of basic beer and spirits (liquor) on a Celebrity cruise ship? For example, Smirnoff Vodka, Heineken or similar.

I am  not a big drinker but may have a drink a night and possibly one 'blowout' if I meet some interesting people.   I'm also considering buying local wine to bring aboard - I understand that there is corkage fees.


**Non-alcoholic drinks**  
What is the  cost of espresso or specialty tea from an onboard Cafe?

Also, what is the quality of tea and coffee with meals?  Is it possible to make tea on board or is it all purchased from cafes?

**Water**

I take it that I can get free water on board - is this from the bathroom in the accommodation or do I have to buy water on bottles or are their cold water dispensers?  I'm uncertain how this works.

Surprisingly, I'm not a tight-ass but if I but a package I'll probably drink a lot more and regret it.","drinks, including hot drinks, on celebrity infinity",,willy_quixote,,0,2023-02-18 09:04:25

I‚Äôm looking to surprise my mom with an Alaskan Cruise booked for 2024. My mom is turning 70 this year and recently our family has been through a lot. My dad left my mom after nearly 40 years of marriage recently and we are still in shock. My mom is amazing and I want to give her a great gift to look forward too. She loves nature, hiking, and bird watching and has never been to Alaska so I thought this would be perfect. A few other family members will also be joining us as part of the surprise.

I‚Äôve done a lot of research already and am looking at an early August 2024 trip on the HAL Eurodam. So here are the questions I have so far:

1. If we‚Äôre sailing through Glacier Bay, is Mendenhall Glacier worth it? I know it‚Äôs a big attraction in Juneau, but I‚Äôm looking at booking an excursion to see a sled dog camp, since we love dogs too. I‚Äôm thinking about combining that with the tram ride later in the day. 

2. Are there any must-haves to make sure we pack for the climate that I don‚Äôt want to forget? I know we should be prepared for cold rain and should have bug spray.

3. To surprise my mom with this trip on her birthday, I want to wrap up some things she can use on the trip like new binoculars, a reusable water bottle, maybe some books about Alaska since she loves to read.

2.  St. Thomas- 8-6 pm (4 ships on dock) We booked for an excursion to go directly to St. John‚Äôs to basically hang out at trunk bay beach. Then if we have time probably hit up Magen bay. 


3. Tortol- 7-5 pm(2ships in dock) . We really want to see the baths at gorda but they are all sold out and to top it off they won‚Äôt allow my toddler . So we figured to just take speedys ferry to virgin gorda and just hang out at spring bay next to the baths.  The Problem is the return trip schedule for speedys is 1130 and 330pm to Tortola .

Carnival‚Äôs website wasn‚Äôt super clear on this (at least not to me), so we need to get passports before the cruise? Also, is it better to book excursions and on-board activities in advance? How early? Do spots fill up so fast that if we wait too long we won‚Äôt have anything to do?

I paid for vacation protection, but I did not pre-pay gratuities. Am I able to adjust the gratuities as we go throughout the cruise? Also, I find the bubbles and cheers packages to be extremely overpriced. Is it worth just buying drinks, water, etc. as needed/wanted?

The deets: we have two children, 3 and 5, and our favorite line is by far Celebrity (pre-kids haha). We‚Äôve also done a Disney cruise and one on Holland and liked them. We enjoy good drinks and food, and taking it slow. We do like entertainment and excursions, but due to the age of the kids, we‚Äôre not there for crazy late night bar hopping or casinos.

We will be stationed in Israel, and would like to take advantage of the cruise point in Haifa. That being said, here are the options - we will be getting a balcony cabin in either scenario.

5 Night Greek Isle cruise on Rhapsody of the Seas for ~$3600.
Or 
7 Night Greek cruise on MSC Musica for ~$3400.
The MSC price includes more (drinks and other upgrades). 

To us, since both ships are different than what we are used to (Rhapsody is much older and smaller than other RCL ships, MSC is more geared to European audience from what I gather), we will need to adjust our expectations no matter what.

Cruise,"I had the pleasure of going on both vessels fairly recently (Mardi Gras in January 2022 and Wonder I have just returned from today). These are just my opinions but I figured I'd share in case there are others who are comparing the two. Others feel free to chime in as well if you have any thoughts! I'm interested to hear. :)

For some context my husband and I are 32 and 33 respectively, I would say that the most important things for us when cruising are the food, entertainment, and excursions. We also both enjoy fitness and comedy, and admittedly we aren't really big partiers and we don't care much for Broadway-style shows or theater. So that will probably inform a lot of our opinions, just to give some forewarning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Food:** Okay, let's start with the most important thing to me when vacationing. I have to go Carnival MG for this one, by a longshot. I was going into RC with high expectations too, as my parents-in-law really hyped up RC like it had much better food but I have to say I enjoy almost every area of MG's dining over Wonder of the Seas. 

* **MDR:** We agreed this one area was equally hit and miss, but I still think MG had far more things I loved and remembered than Wonder. For Wonder, I think their best offering by far was the crab cake offered on day 1. We had the opportunity to try the ""new menus"" that some people seem to dread, but not having any previous experience with RC I felt the menus were varied and interesting. The food was just sub par, it felt low quality and bland. Appetizers and desserts usually had a better shot of being good with the entrees usually being pretty forgettable unfortunately. That said, there are some dishes I just REMEMBER and crave on MG like the strawberry bisque, salmon cake, and of course the chocolate melting cake. Even their tuna and salmon salad on sea days or breakfasts were more creative and flavorful than what I feel Wonder had to offer. 
* **Specialty Dining:** 
   * On MG we went to **Farenheit 555 Steakhouse** and **Bonsai Teppanyaki**. I REALLY enjoyed my meal at Farenheit, I had a wonderful tuna tartar for my appetizer and the chocolate sphere for dessert. They also had a lovely watermelon martini that I went back to the bar for later in my trip. For my entree, I'm actually not that big a steak fan so I went with the sea bass and I remember it being good but not like blow my socks off amazing, but overall the meal was wonderful and service was spectacular. Bonsai was also pretty good, I remember particularly liking the small plates they served as appetizers, and the salmon and garlic fried rice were good (and also way too much food for me personally). I did think the service itself was kind of cheesy/forced with the singing and party tricks, but I feel like that's a common American teppanyaki thing and the rest of our party seemed to be having a good time so I figure we might be the minority there.
   * For Wonder we did the 3 night specialty dining package and elected to go for **Wonderland, the Mason Jar, and Izumi sushi**. I'll start with what I was surprised to enjoy the most, which was Mason Jar. Their crab beignets and watermelon salad were delicious and the fried oreos were also really good, if not filling. One of those things I'd never had the opportunity to try before since I don't live near any fairs! I got a blackberry moonshine cocktail and I think they may have shorted me on the alcohol, neither of us said anything but they ended up not charging me for the drink and it didn't taste strong at all so I just assume that's what happened. As for Izumi, I thought it was worthwhile for sure. It lacked a little bit of flavor but overall I enjoyed everything I got. I thought 2 large plates was going to be too much food for me so I asked if I could get 2 small plates + 1 large instead and got the gyoza, cripsy rice with spicy tuna, and sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and tasted good (most important part) and while I thought the gyoza and spicy tuna could have been more punchy, I finished both plates. I also thought my husband's karaage was good, although it could have used a little more salt or time in a marinade but it was juicy and tasty. What ended up being my least favorite, Wonderland, breaks my heart because I was really excited for this one! I love creative menus and will try anything once, so I was excited for our culinary adventure, and while some things were good...many were just plain bad. Like inedible bad. Too many things were made out of gelatin and fondant and just had absolutely no redeeming flavor to make up for the unappealing texture. I also felt that the service felt the most forced and uncomfortable here, as they used very flowery language and tried to ""perform"" a bit but it just didn't really land for me. Again, that's not really my style so maybe some people find it enjoyable, but I thought it was kind of cringey unfortunately. I also was really disappointed in the cocktails here. They make it seem like the drinks are going to have some showmanship but the ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" cocktail just has a little piece of red or blue gelatin in the bottom and the White Rabbit Rita did not have anything special going on other than it was blue (blue curacao)? I think it was supposed to have salt foam but I didn't get any.
* **Complimentary Dining:** MG wins by a landslide in this department. Guy's burgers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Johnny Rockets (and JR costs $, which is a crime against humanity as far as I'm concerned), Pizzeria del Capitano &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorrento's, MG has really great paninis, it has the dim sum/skewers/french fry snack stop...I gained weight on MG because of how much delicious food was accessible at all times. And the ICE CREAM. Why do they have attendants at Sprinkes (RC)? Is that something that's happening on MG now too, because I do not need my ice cream intake supervised. And they only have vanilla and chocolate, where is the strawberry I ask?! And only being available in 1 spot means the number of times I walk by and think ""why not?"" is significantly less. I can't speak lower of how bad I thought the quality of the complimentary food options at RC were. I think the best thing was literally the hot dog stand on Boardwalk, which isn't saying much because I only felt the need to go there once. I CRAVED the pizza on MG, it was so fresh and delicious and they had my favorite pizza topping, chili oil\~ Guy's burgers is fire even when comparing to some of my favorite land options for burgers. It's NO CONTEST.
* **Bar:** I guess I'll add this here as well, I have a bone to pick with RC about their drink prices. They were $16.50 including the added gratuity, which to me felt really pricey. I am usually a 2-3 drinks a day on vacation type of girl, and my husband doesn't really drink at all, he might have 2-3 over the entire cruise. So the drink package are out, they just don't make sense for that amount of drinking. That said, I feel like drinks on Carnival are like $2-4 less and I feel like that makes me much more likely to buy them. Also, I thought the drinks on RC were typically weak. I asked how much it would be for a double and was told it would be $30...which...I am confused about and maybe there was a language barrier because usually it would be like $5. I think on Carnival it is $4. Also just the creativity of the drinks, I feel, was better at Carnival. Between the Alchemy bar and the Fortune Teller bar I feel like I got some very creative drinks with way more showmanship as well. I also like that they do pitchers in the comedy club as when we are with family it can be fun to just get a pitcher for everyone to share.

**Shows/Entertainment:**

I have mixed opinions on this one. When it comes to Broadway-style shows, I must admit, RC blows Carnival out of the water. We saw Intense and it was pretty awesome actually, the gymnasts were incredibly talented and me and my husband both agreed the music direction was pretty cool. I feel like the producer of Intense must have been a fan of Interstellar, which I can totally relate to. &lt;3 That said, as I mentioned before, the Broadway shows aren't make or break for me. I wouldn't be sad if I didn't see any at all on my whole cruise, so while the show was incredible it isn't a major selling point for me. What is typically more important to me is the comedy shows, and I feel like MG beats Wonder hand over fist here. For one, they had far more comedians. I think it was 5 vs the 2 we had on Wonder, and I would say on average they were way funnier. I also thought the variety shows were way more enjoyable and comedic on MG. The Love &amp; Marriage style show was way more entertaining and I like all the game shows like Family Feud as well, they usually get a few chuckles out of me. I also like that they usually have a magic show on Carnival, although I will admit the one on MG was pretty crap when we went. It was one of those illusionist types rather than like physical magic like cards, making things disappear, etc. Not for me personally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Staff/Service:**

Not a huge selling point for me since I'd like to think I'm not a complainer whatsoever, but there were a few things worth mentioning. I think a good cruise director can set the tone for a fun cruise and often makes or breaks a lot of the shows depending on how gregarious/funny/interesting they are and I do tend to like Carnival's cruise directors better. I actually thought the captain on Wonder was pretty funny though, I kind of wish he had been more vocal he usually had some good quips during his updates each day. As far as the rest of the service goes, I have mixed feelings for both. I feel that when Carnival makes their waitstaff sing and dance it can be a little bit cringe, but I feel that service on Wonder was kind of forced and scripted as well. Everyone was perfectly polite on both cruises but I feel like Carnival feels a bit more human and less robotic. Also I really missed towel animals on RC! I know they do them since my family I was traveling with got some, but our stateroom attendant didn't make any for us and I didn't care to make a stink about it since it isn't a huge deal but they are cute. &lt;3 In both cases we were well taken care of and both ships are kept very clean, but I feel like Carnival has a warmer/friendlier feel to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Smaller things:**

* **Wifi** \- We felt Carnival's wifi was better and more reliable. Both are expensive. I hope cruises soon adopt Virgin's model of just including internet someday since most people would prefer to stay connected or in many cases need to for whatever reason.
* **Atmosphere** \- Again, we preferred Mardi Gras by a margin. Wonder has some really cool areas, I liked the Solarium and Central Park looked really cool even though I never really had a reason to go there. But I think overall some of their decor budget is wasted, I don't really care for the giant tophat in the promenade. I also like that the MG has far more deck space. I feel like when I'm on a cruise I like to stay close to the water, it's relaxing and I don't typically spring for a balcony since you can typically enjoy the sea from on deck. That said, Wonder feels VERY enclosed. There are a few spots you can go to get a good view, but it feels way more like a big floating mall than a cruise ship.
* **App/website** \- Carnival's is way easier to use and less buggy. I also really hated how many things you needed to reserve to have a chance to do on Wonder of the Seas. I am a planner, but my family isn't and so trying to get us all scheduled for things was a nightmare. In the end we did have some success waiting in the non-reserved line for things but it's no guarantee, you could wait in line 40 minutes+ and may not have a spot. I also like that on Carnival's shore excursions you can see reviews. Reviews have saved me before from picking a booking I probably wouldn't have ended up enjoying, so I like being able to see what people enjoyed and what they didn't.

Anyways, I've written a manifesto and I want to remind everyone these are just my opinions! My husband and I jokingly said we will probably be Carnival diamond members before we try another RC cruise but I'm interested to see how others feel! I feel like if we try another line in the future we may try Virgin, since it's adults only and food-oriented I bet it would be up our ally.

Cruise," Hi!

**We are a mid-30s couple looking to book our first cruise to Alaska. We are first-time cruisers and it‚Äôs our first time to Alaska!**

We have narrowed it down to the below cruises and would like some help picking one. We are quite adventurous and will take part in a bunch of shore activities.

The cruises are not exactly comparable (Seabourn vs Princess e.g.) but we are planning to get the basic (Ocean View Suite) on Seabourn and the 2nd to highest cabin on others (e.g., Mini Suite on Princess or Signature Suite on Holland America)

We would spend a few days in Anchorage visiting Denali and Katmai (either before or after the cruise) and a do a daytrip to Glacier Bay NP as well. So, we don‚Äôt mind missing out on Glacier Bay on the itinerary.

Some concerns we have:

1. Would be significantly younger than the clientele of these cruises? Is so, which would be the closest to our age group?

2. How formal is Seabourn? Do we need suits/tuxes and evening gowns?

3. We are not big drinkers, so we don‚Äôt particularly care for the drinks‚Äô packages. We do like to enjoy good food.

4. On-board entertainment is welcome but not a deal breaker. We are happy reading a book.

5. Is one of these itineraries significantly better than the others? E.g., Seabourn has kayaking and zodiac options with the chance to visit the Inian Islands. That sounds like something we would like.

6. We want to prioritize wildlife viewing.

7. Our budget does not stretch to Uncruise / Lindblad.

Is it legitimate to hang out in your cabin or somewhere out of the way of the main traffic flows if you don't want to deal with the ""rat race"" of passengers all cramming to get off the ship? Or is this not allowed, and when it's time to leave you better be out of the room and have joined the queues of disembarking passengers?

I'm going on my first ever cruise later this year and I have a bit of a history of not being great on ships or boats. When I booked it I'd been told that the ship doesn't really feel like it's moving at all and I'll be fine, but since then I've spoke to a few people who experience seasickness who have told me the opposite. 

For some context I get sick on car journeys. I'm 30 years old and I still get that thing where I feel my stomach jump if I go over a hill. It takes me a while to adjust to my surroundings if I go on a train or anything, in the sense that I feel like I'm moving faster than I am and like I'm about to fall over all the time. When I get off elevators I have to hold on to the wall for a minute. On smaller boats I mostly vomit on and off for a few hours and/or completely lose my coordination for a few days and can't go in to confined spaces because they trigger a loss of balance. 

The biggest boat I have been on up until now was the Stena Superfast VIII and I felt nauseous to the point where I had to just sit with my head down and my eyes closed so I didn't throw up. It came in waves so I was able to get up and do stuff in ~20 minute intervals before feeling completely crippled with nausea again.

Then kept quoting prices for the cruise that I wanted that were higher than what I saw online. And I am a Diamond member. Now I got a credit with them that I am unsure how to use or retrieve.

The only reason why I cruise MSC is because they have international presence and their repositioning cruises take me where I need to go, and would otherwise need to fly to for about the same price.

Cruise,"My parents, my wife, and I will be going on an Alaskan cruise in July 2024\*.  My parents are treating us, and it's our first cruise.  I've been tasked with researching which cruise line to go with between Norwegian or Princess.  I'm leaning Princess since we're all 45+ in age, and we would prefer to avoid hordes of kids.  In researching which cruises and ships to go with, am I obsessing too much over avoiding older ships?  Is a ship built 20 years ago, but refurbished a couple years ago, just as good as a ship built a couple years ago?  Am I crazy for focusing on the newly built Discovery Princess over the 20-year old Sapphire Princess or 10-year old Royal Princess, for example?

Next question: In your opinion, which type of 7-day Alaskan cruise is better?  One-way or a roundtrip?   For reference, the roundtrip from Seattle is on the new Discovery Princess, while one of the one-way options would be the older Royal Princess.

Should we even stick to the choice of NCL v Princess, or should I try to talk my parents in Holland America Line?  HAL appears to skew to an even older demographic than Princess, so even less kids onboard is a plus.   I certainly like what I see of the Koningsdam, sailing out of Vancouver.

Cruise,"This was my experience on a recent Margaritaville at Sea cruise from Feb 5 to Feb 8, 2023. Please note this was my experience and other experiences could have been different. 

I do cruise often and enjoy them. I have been on cheaper cruises and higher end cruises so I had my mind set that this was going to be like nothing I have experienced. 

We took an Uber to the port, was dropped off and proceeded to the ‚Äúluggage check‚Äù counter. Upon entering the terminal, there is a big sign, no food or drinks allowed inside, this included a bottle of water I had to chug before entering. Once you enter, x-ray scanner, then hand your bag off to the attendant. Once you head upstairs, you check-in, which seems like a very long process, which I don‚Äôt think needed to be, but hey, it‚Äôs vacation so what‚Äôs a little line. 

After you check-in, here comes the head tilt. First, the customary photo on green screen, we passed, and a guy trying showing off the wine list asking us to buy a bottle before we get on board. From there we went to the excursion desk, ask about the specifics of the excursion and the attendant had no information for us. What time do we meet? A ticket under your door by 930p. How long does it last? A ticket under your door by 930p. Not exactly helpful or inviting. Since we purchased a drink package, we to that table and was told to go to the 8th floor to get the wristband. I asked where on the 8th floor, he said yes, 8th floor, but I said where and he said 8th floor. Then we went to the dining table. They wanted us to sign up for the premium dining, which I declined. He said enjoy the buffet. I said well what about dinner, he said buffet is open from x time to x time. Getting frustrated, I departed. As I rounded the table I see 1st dining and 2nd dining. I got back around and asked about 1st dining and 2nd. They said, sure what time would I like‚Ä¶..I said 2nd. I forgot to ask but they also didn‚Äôt tell me where the dining room was, which I had to ask later. 

Once I‚Äôm the ship, there really was no employees available to ask about directions, but found a map and headed towards the lunch buffet. It took us a few, but finally found it. The buffet food was edible, not ok, not great, not amazing, edible. The buffet line was separated into four different sections, which was confusing. 

The music, huge Buffett fan, was fantastic, the drinks were pricey and they kept pushing the souvenir cup which came pricey refills as well. The ship definitely shows her age: rust spots, oxidation, spaces with no real purpose, and the occasional whiff of sewer smell. Our room was ready early which was good, so we went there. 

We were on the 7th floor aft, towards the very back. The room was decorated nicely and was larger than I thought. There was an odor in the air which we couldn‚Äôt place but noticed stains on our bed sheets. We quickly called for a change and they were very responsive and apologetic. I was shocked there wasn‚Äôt a paper on daily activities but looked on the tv and tried to remember what we needed to do. 

We figured out were dinner was, which was interesting. The menu had choices, good, and the food was ok. The biggest shock was at the end of the night when a four top had only two guests and the waiter took a napkin, dusted off the crumbs, and set the other two places, not changing the table cloth or anything else. Also we were shocked to see that the premium dining area shared the same dining room, minus a small partition. 

The last major critique, besides entertainers forgetting words to songs, was that smell I mentioned in our room. After a while that smell was worse and worse that‚Äôs because when you flush the toilet, the sewer opened up and flowed onto the floor. The bath mat / towel smelled putrid. Plus we had to wash our feet every time we left the bathroom. 

To say I will not be returning is an understatement, just not my thing. I did enjoy escaping the dull of winter in Freeport but the ride there and back was not worth it in my opinion.

Cruise,"First time cruise with RC, and will probably be the last. OH has sailed prior to Covid and believes the company has gone way downhill. 
We had 2/3 ports cancelled due to bad weather and understand that this is a possibility but the way it was handled was really poor - in the form of a small on board credit. We paid $4k for our room and you give us $150 for missing two stops and then changing the other? Knowing people will end up spending more on board due to being on for 2 extra sea days. 
 Our one salvaged port was reduced greatly and the date change meaning we got 5 hours all up, and docked so late all tours and anything worth doing was completely sold out. 

The food was below average - the dining was really hit and miss in terms of organisation and food quality. Steaks over cooked or undercooked, rest of food just okay. 

Expensive - we like to splurge on holidays but the cost of everything was exorbitant compared to other cruises. The cheapest game of bingo was $40, drinks way above average of anywhere else. It just feels so money-focused it puts me off. The ‚Äúfree‚Äù activities were always booked out but the paid versions were available. Why not free and limit per room to ensure everyone gets an opportunity. 

On top of that, Covid was rampant and ended up getting it myself. It‚Äôs clear that their policy for having people test themselves prior to boarding is being abused - would perhaps work better if they made people test in front of staff. 

One thing to give credit for was how hard working the staff are, these people do such a tough job and are always pleasant. Interested to hear others opinions.",RC - downhill?,,lp211,,0,2023-02-11 01:27:46

Cruise,"Background: 5th/6th cruise. I usually sail Carnival with kids and family, first time on NCL, first time flying to a cruise port, sailed in an interior room with 2 other adult women.

Cruise reservation cost - approximately $300-400 per person

How I saved$$$

Flew Spirit at approximately $80 RT. I purchased one way tickets from DFW to FLL. Arrived one day before sailing. No checked bags or carryons. 

Booked an interior room for lowest rate. The interior room was excellent for sleeping in pure darkness. I didn't care for the room set up. It was two twin beds and one rollaway bed. The bedding on the rollaway was very comfy but it was hard to move through the room when the bed was down.

Removed added extras included in NCL promos. Many NCL packages will include the beverage package, specialty dining, etc. They add the packages but also charge gratuities. For 3 people for 3 day cruise the added gratuities for the drink package was approx $197. Only 2/3 of us were drinking and we are not heavy drinkers. We called ahead to remove the drinks and gratuties. We paid for drinks as we wanted them. 

The itinerary included two stops. One was replaced and one was canceled due to weather. We went to Nassau and spent $5/pp for a ferry boat to Atlantis, followed by a taxi to Cabbage Beach, and $5/pp in a shared taxi to return downtown Nassau near cruise port. I am definitely making this stop to Atlantis and Paradise Island again. We spent time at the casino and walked the shops. The beach was fairly clean but beautiful.  I think we overpaid on the ride to Cabbage Beach due to last-minute changes. We gave the driver $20 for 3 of us. Many great places to take photos and hang out.

On the last day, we had a lot of free time. Flights home departed around 5pm. We took a lyft to the FLL airport and got a day rental. We drive just a few miles to FLL Beach and Boardwalk for lunch. There are lots of great people watching and more cute shops. 

Biggest takeaways -


1.I'll definitely keep watching short itineraries out of Miami--especially to try different cruise lines.
2.I can't wait to get back to Atlantis (Casino lol) 
3. Another seamless travel experience on Spirit

Cruise,"Frankly, NCL's shore excursions for our Nordic cruise in August are way more expensive than they should be. For example, $200 per person for a 90 minute city walking tour. I've travelled a lot (though rarely by boat) and I know these city walking tours are often offered for free or for an optional donation. 

Or a particular tour I found from a 3rd party (identical itinerary) for $150/person while NCL is charging $450.

I know I can book some 3rd party excursions in advance, and I plan to book some. My question is, is it reasonable to expect to find some tour options offered in the port without booking them in advance?

I know it varies by port, but I just can't find a lot of information about these specific ports online. I've found reviews, but not a lot of specifics on booking 3rd party tours. I've searched this sub too, but most of the advice pertains to the Caribbean where I think there is enough demand to allow operators to book tours day-of. I'm worried the ""quieter"" ports we're going to will be more challenging in that regard.

For reference these are our ports of call:

1. Isafjordur, Iceland
2. Akureyri, Iceland
3. Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland (so far I'm not even sure how we're supposed to dock at this tiny village, and I can't see any obvious tourism infrastructure)

Cruise,"My husband and I have been on 7 cruises so far.  All but one cruise has been on Royal.  We truly love Royal, never a bad experience.   Our first cruise was on Carnival, which we didn't like.  We like to get dressed up here and there, but for the most part we are a laid back, casual couple.  Royal has always suited us perfectly.

Next year we are planning on taking a cruise to include a stop in Aruba.  We prefer our departure port be in NJ/NY, but Florida is good too.  I've looked at Celebrity and Princess cruises, but to be honest they seem a little ""booshie"", ""snooty"" (maybe I'm wrong).  Since we've never been on either, we would love some reviews on Celebrity and Princess or any other cruise line that you think would be another option apart from Royal.

Hello. We are leaving on the above cruise coming up at the end of April. It starts in Barcelona and then goes to Cannes, France, Genoa, Italy, La Spezia, Italy, Civitavecchia, Italy and then Palma de Mallorca, Spain before returning to Barcelona

We took the Fantastica package because we had to as the cruise was selling out. It only added about $60 pp. We are trying to keep our costs down as we are going to another destination after the cruise.  We did add the excursion to Rome and the Vatican as we definitely wanted to see that but haven't added anything else yet.

Questions:  
What should we pack? 

Should we upgrade our stateroom \[with window view\] to balcony? Our best friends are joining us on this cruise and elected for window rooms - the exclaim that we likely will spend very little time in the room regardless. But I imagine it would be nice in the evenings to tuck away and enjoy the view on our balcony. 

We have ""free at the sea"" package. Of course we will be drinking and using our meal credits etc - What do you recommend we look for? 

We already paid for the cruise \[$3100?\] and prepaid gratuity \[$280\]. We are planning excursions every step of the way as well! We also need to book flights - can we get discounted flights through NCL?

Just wondering what on board activities are available on Princess? I've just booked a Majestic Princess cruise to New Zealand for next January. My husband and I sailed with Princess almost 10 years ago but to be honest didn't participate in any of the activities really, we're more the relaxing and reading by the pool type.

However, we've just come off an RCI cruise with our 6 year old daughter who had a blast at dance classes, trivia, arts and crafts etc. She wasn't much into kids club (I think it felt more like daycare and therefore not fun) but enjoyed going to all the other activities with me.

I know Princess is a little more upscale and relaxed, and because I don't recall what activities were available, I'm worried there'll be less for her to do?

Also do they show movies in the theatres? I remember them doing this out on deck but wonder if they do this indoors as well. She loved this on RCI and has already asked me if she can ""go to the movies"" on Princess.

Cruise,"First time cruiser and we are trying to plan out our excursions and port days. Since I've never gone, I'm looking for advice on making the best use of time. i.e. making our 'beach day' at the best beach and 'snorkeling day' at the bet snorkeling area.



## **Ocho Rios**

Due to this being the most negative place in terms of being bugged by locals, we are booking an excursion with the ship for **dolphin cove + Dunn falls**. That way we can avoid scammers and have the relaxation of knowing that the boat will wait for us on our first day. especially at this port.


## **Nassau**

Making this a ""beach day"" due to it not being as good as the next two ports. We want a day to relax. And there seem to be some public beaches here to do this.

## **Cozumel**

Snorkeling and/or Mr Sanchos beach club

## **Georgetown**

Walking around the port. Maybe swimming with stinrays, but more exploring on our own since this is the ""safest"" port","First timer, need advice on our plan for our port days (Nassau - Ocho Rios - Georgetown - Cozumel)",,ObjectiveDev,,0,2023-02-06 02:39:08
Cruise,Hope all are well this Sunday. I could really use some input from more experienced cruisers. Originally was supposed to book on a Carnival cruise (group of fiance‚Äôs buddys cruising) mid summer which he‚Äôd been informed about kind of last minute. By the time we were able to get the info all the cheaper cabins were booked so a no go . We are now looking into MSC namely meraviglia but my issue is that i‚Äôve read reviews that have me thinking that you are basically hoping to have a good experience as the reviews are either very good or very bad especially re:the food. People have also complained about the crew‚Äôs attitudes. Also my main concern are the stories of people waiting 5 hours or more for embarkation in hot weather which is a big problem for me with MS as i cannot stand extended periods especially in extreme heat. I‚Äôd noticed the Aurea SP?? package which claimed preferential embarkation it seemed over priced for what it offers and this was confirmed by watching vids on Youtube explaining the benefits of each.

Cruise,"Hi all, deciding which ship to book with for Alaska out of Vancouver. The Volendam cruise for June is about $1,600 and leaves mid week whereas the Koningsdam one is around $1,800 and leaves on a Saturday. 

Not too significant of a difference in pricing but is the extra $ worth it? I think the Koningsdam ship is newer and probably has a bit more on it.  Per the website, the K one has the pizza thing and V doesn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm from nyc so it doesn‚Äôt matter really for me

Cruise,"For the short and sweet that just want an overall star rating I would give it 3/5 stars because it just felt subpar and anything good was outweighed by the bad. I haven't cruised since before COVID so IDK if all cruise lines are like this now. My expereinces are below.

To start I'll say boarding the ship was a fairly smooth process. Took probably an hourish and we were in. 

The first day was rough. We had booked everything through the phone and were told that 4 adults could ""easily"" fit into one of their cabins. Having done so with Carnival in the past I took them at their word and booked a single cabin for 4 adults. We walked into the room to find 2 twin beds and a pullout. Not enough room for 4 adults at all. We went to guest services to see if we were given the wrong room and were told that the room options were either 2 twin beds with a pull out or a king size bed with a pullout. We asked how this could be described as fitting four adults at all when we were told it could ""easily"" fit 4. We asked if another cabin was available and were told that it was a full ship (remember this for later) and we would have to make do. Understanding we went back to the room to troubleshoot and used multiple pillows and a spare mattress to fundamentally convert the single pullout couch into a double bed. Later on, the 2 adults we were sharing a room with went to purchase some drinks and ordered 2 shots of Absolut and 2 strawberry daiquiris. This was $62 USD. After that absurd pricing they decided to purchase the drink package and were told that all members in the cabin would need to purchase the drink package. We tried explaining that my SO and I are sober and would not be drinking in which we were told we need to purchase the $300USD non-alcoholic beverage package. At this point we asked again if there were any available cabins to move into and were told again it was a full cruise and no cabins were available so we sucked it up and accepted the purchase. A frustrating start to the cruise, but nonetheless we were excited. A few hours later we overheard some other people on the cruise state that they had there room changed. This was surprising since that must have meant there was an available room for them to switch too. The next day, in our hallway, we saw multiple rooms with there SeaPass cards still on the door, meaning they hadn't showed up. So there were (most likely) rooms available for us to purchase but were told there was not and at this point it was too late since we had purchased the beverage package. This was a trend the entire week, getting on elevators with people saying that they are much happier with there new room, or that there keycard to the new room isn't working so they need to get it fixed. 

We went to dinner the first night and the server and his assistant server were very professional and hard working. I can assure you they tried there absolute best, however from night one it was clear they were overworked. We saw my server taking care of multiple large tables that all came in at the same time every night, which meant no matter how hard they worked they could not achieve proper service. Over the week, they forgot drinks, charged drinks to our table we did not have, forgot mains, delivered the wrong mains, forgot coffees, took a long time to bring drinks and did not check on the table during courses. However, as said previously it was clear they were working hard and trying their best, they were just simply understaffed and overworked. So when the manager came around to ask how everything was we didn't say anything about the service quality because it was clear the manager would just yell at them to do better and not fix the issue of understaffing.

Next, the buffet food was subpar. A few choices like the mac and cheese were good but one day it was good and the next day it was bland. There was little consistency and it often felt like I was eating yesterdays leftovers instead of fresh food. In addition, the buffets were closed and certain points of the day, from 1030am - 12pm, from 3pm-5pm, and from 8pm until the next morning the buffets were closed. If you were hungry at these times the only option was pizza. This was surprising as previous cruises I've attended had midnight buffets or 12 hour straight buffets. The closing of food was frustrating.

Next, the cruise was a money pit. $2.00USD for a tiny box of popcorn, $4.00USD for cotton candy, $9.00 USD for a small smoothie, $20.00USD for the escape room, no soda unless you had the beverage package, only drip coffee unless you had the drink package, any fitness class was an additional cost and I'm sure much more little fees that when paying for a cruise I would expect are free. To me, these fees should be included in the purchase price of the ticket but instead RCCL made the price of the ticket low to get us onboard and then basically said if you want anything onboard pay a fee. 

The onboard casino was intimidating. Many of the players there were kind and having a good time, but every dealer I came across was rude, intense, intimidating, and grilled me like I was from a rival gang or something. I played a few games of craps in the past but don't gamble often at all and so I never truly learned. I saw some guys having fun there so when the table was more empty I went over to join in and learn how to play. The ENTIRE time the casino staff grilled me, staring at me HARD watching my every move. So I went to play blackjack, a game I'm much more familiar with and enjoy playing and the exact same feeling was there as well. I tried different dealers/staff and every single one (with the exception of one lady) made me feel grossly uncomfortable. 

Entertainment was subpar aswell. There are 3 theatres, a jazz bar, a nightclub and a comedy club. The comedy was hilarious the first night, so we went to see the second night and it was the same comedians giving similar jokes. In a 30 minute set, 20 minutes were jokes I had heard the night before so I figured that entertainment was done but thoroughly enjoyed. The jazz bar, DJ, and musicians were absolutely amazing. However, on floor 5 when a band was playing I couldn't hear a word it was so loud. In the theatres, we watched HIRO which was cool, and the gameshow love and marriage which was hilarious. Every other show was either fully reserved or took place during our dinner at 8:00 pm. Although this was not a big deal because there weren't many other shows, the only other shows were hairspray, 1977 (or some number like that), flight, and I believe one other show. For a ship with 3 theatres I was expecting a bit more in entertainment to be frank. 

I figured with such a big ship I could find loungers for sea days to hang out on. Nope.

Design flaws like having the only smoking sections be in the casino, or in an enclosed space on the opposite side of the kids splashpad. A 5 minute walk across the ship and no water to be found anytime the buffets were closed other than on the 5th floor (the main floor) in the middle of the ship at the pizza place 

Getting on and off the ship was super easy and fast. The staff outside of the casino were very friendly and kind and hardworking. 

Honestly though, personally I will never cruise with RCCL ever again, and just hope that other cruise lines are not trying to cut corners at every opportunity post-covid like RCCL.",A Review of Symphony of the Seas (RCCL),,Nextgengameing,,0,2023-02-05 23:10:12

I know Hawaiian cruises are more expensive by nature due to it being a US flagged ship, so the pricing isn‚Äôt surprising. We are on the east coast so this would also mean much more expensive flights. 

Just looking for some input from anyone who has done both. Is the Hawaiian cruise worth all the expense?  I‚Äôm just concerned about going and feeling like it was a lot more expensive for much of the same feel. 

The cruise is 7 day, I checked an inside room and it would be about 5k without flights (I can cover those with points). For a 7 day Caribbean with the same budget you could essentially go all out.

We imagine we'll spend much of our time off the ship but like the idea of not having to unpack/repack ferry around that would be needed with a land only experience.

We value: 

* great service (with an easy going vibe), quality settings without being fussy
* great food and bev program 
* ability to enjoy water sports off the ship
* fast and easy on/off ship
* smaller ports
* comfortable stateroom for when we want to recharge (movies, room service, etc).
* occasional ambiance on ship - music, a bit of romance (love the sleeping under the stars option on SeaDream)

So far SeaDream Yacht Club is the leader for us but I'm not finding current (or many at all) current reviews. Windstar is a closer second - lots of reviews. We've also been looking into Windstar (a bit bigger ship). 

Would love to hear feedback from:

* folks who have been on SeaDream Yacht Club recently (last 5 years) especially doing Med routes.
* anyone who's been on SeaDream AND Windstar - comparatively  - SeaDream is more expensive - worth it? esp since the staterooms don't have verandas?

\- A pool on board with a pool bar

\- Good food. And I don't want to stress about whether or not we'll be able to get in the ""good"" restaurants because we didn't reserve in time or didn't know what to do

\- Explore new, interesting, beautiful areas of the world under the supervision of people who know what they're doing (as I said, we have never left the country and are intimidated by traveling abroad)

\- Entertainment (music, comedy, magic, etc.)

\- Not to be nickel and dimed by unexpected expenses. I would strongly prefer to pay more up front and keep the extra expenses few and far between.

\- Wifi would be nice to have but not a must

What we don't care about:

\- Casinos

\- Whether or not there are kid activities

Cruise,"Headed on a cruise this spring. And I‚Äôm really struggling with pain for the beverage package. If they didn‚Äôt charge us much for the day that you were in Port, and not on their island where it still counts, I would be perfectly fine with it. Since it has a three night cruise, you‚Äôre really only on the cruise half of the day for embarkation. Then the next day is a port stop and you‚Äôre in port most of the day the third day is their island where the drink package carries over so that‚Äôs fine and the final day you‚Äôll just get up and get off the ship.

All that being said, I am really considering using one of my two bottles of wine to bring rum or vodka. And then just purchasing some drinks at the individual cost. 

I‚Äôve been researching, and there are people who use water bottles and reseal them with caps from Amazon. People who replace the corks and foil seal people who use rum runners - the plastic bags.

Cruise,"So my best friend and I are former Disney Parks cast members who have never been on a Disney cruise - for the past two years we've made an annual WDW trip in August/September but we're thinking of switching it up and doing a cruise this year. We were thinking a 4 or 5 day Bahamas/Bermuda cruise sometime in that time frame, and we were both eager to try the Disney Wish since we hear it's a spectacular ship.

I started looking and price comparing, and noticed we could do a 5-7 night Royal Caribbean itinerary for quite literally almost half the price, and we wouldn't have to fly to cruise (RCCL goes out of New York, where we live, whereas we'd have to fly down to FL to cruise Disney). I've cruised RCCL before on Anthem and Liberty and enjoyed both, but they were large cruises with my extended family as a teen, so I haven't cruised as an adult. The RCCL itineraries we were looking at are on Anthem.

For Disney fans, do you think the large premium for a shorter Disney cruise is worth it? Like I said, I've been on the Anthem before and really enjoyed it, but I've never cruised on Disney (my friend has never cruised at all). I thought about choosing RCCL and using the money we'd save to go on a trip to Universal for Halloween Horror Nights later in the fall. But I've done that itinerary before, so it might be worth it to splurge for Disney.

We took a cruise from Singapore last week (Spectrum of the Seas), and we love trivia and game shows but kind of gave up on them after realizing how widespread cheating was. Every single game, if it was possible, lots of groups cheated, and very blatantly, with hosts doing nothing. I've never seen anything like this in the cruises departing from America.

Example 1: Host hands out a sheet with logic puzzles and 15 minutes to solve them. 75% of the groups immediately pull out their phones and start googling them. Not even furtively, just openly. Host says nothing. Ditto for the game where you identify cities from a photo.

Example 2: We're doing a quiz show where you identify something on a screen. As we go through the answers, the host comes around and asks who got a certain difficult one. Two of us give the right answer, everyone else is saying they had no answer or give wrong answers. He goes from table to table. Only two of us. Then at the end of the game? *THREE GROUPS CLAIM TO HAVE PERFECT SCORES*. And it's not either of us. None of those three knew that answer when he came to talk to them.

And of course there were the usual issues. 

* Host: ""What is the largest island?"" 
* Us: ""Are you counting continents like Australia as islands? If not, we know it's Greenland."" 
* Host: ""Sure, continents count.""
* We write down Australia.
*Host: The answer is Greenland!
* Us: But... you said continents like Australia count...

My partner and I are based in the US and would like to book a Caribbean cruise for late-February. It‚Äôs all very last-minute but we‚Äôre sick of the cold, gloomy weather and need a vitamin D boost.

We‚Äôve only been on one cruise before - to Alaska with Celebrity. After much research, we‚Äôd like to stick with Celebrity for now. We don‚Äôt have kids and would prefer something quieter, and the dates line up.

We‚Äôre Caribbean virgins. We like to spend time on beautiful beaches, go for hikes, and snorkel (if the reef is decent).

10 Day Eastern Caribbean on Celebrity Constellation in ocean view room. 

7 Day Bahamas, Mexico, and Grand Cayman on Celebrity Beyond in veranda room. 

Edge looks gorgeous but I worry the interior room will feel like a cupboard. I wouldn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd spend much time in there, but is it usually easy to get loungers on the pool deck? 

Constellation looks much older and not as nice as the others, but it‚Äôs far cheaper and the itinerary sounds ok. Thoughts?

I loved that we were able to visit so many places without having to pack up and deal with a new room/environment each day and worry about losing my things, everything is planned out in advance and I always knew what to expect, and being able to exploreand do stuff on the ship or find a quiet place to relax on my own schedule was wonderful. It was the best trip Ive ever been on and the first one where I didn't have any anxiety whatsoever. My mom agreed to do another for my 21st which is on May 15, 2024. It would be me, my mom, my dad, and my boyfriend. We are all on the autistic spectrum and very much introverted, and don't really like casinos or parties. we have a moderate budget, so no huge rooms or really upscale lines, but we can splurge on a couple nights of non-included dining and shore excursions. I don't really care for drinking or alcohol at all, so on my birthday I may just get like a small cocktail or something. I was looking at Virgin and Royal Carribean, but I am open to others. But here are my main questions:

1. Which lines have required alcohol packages and which have soda/juice/etc packages?
2.  What do different lines typically do for birthdays?
3. We would get 2 staterooms. My parents are split but very close friends, can they convert the bed into 2 twins? 
4. Which ships have the best places to sit by the ocean or just to relax away from crowds? 
5. Virgin's cruises in 2024 start and end right on my birthday, RC has one on Icon that's right on my birthday. Are big ships terrible when it comes to crowds/lines/ other social anxiety producing things? Or better since you can disappear into the crowd and not be noticed?",Best cruise for a 21st birthday with an autistic family?,,LowMemory578,,0,2023-02-02 17:49:36

My family of 4 are leaving on our first cruise in March, spring break, out of the Port of Miami on NCL for a 7 day cruise in the Caribbean.

Most of the posts online says this is not worth it, but everything I‚Äôve seen is 3 years old, in the middle of Covid, or the ship is not at capacity/small port, etcetera. So is it still not worth it, post Covid world, on what appears to be a fairly full ship, out of Miami?

Give or take, same price.  3 adults though.    


It has been maybe 20 years since I stayed in a standard balcony room and that was just with spouse.  Seabourn standard is at least the equivalent of a mini suite with a sofa on other lines but man.  That is not a lot of space.  My adult (by that time) son would have to be on the sofa bed.

We spend a LOT of time in our cabin and on our balcony.  Though if Seabourn is as chill/quiet as it sounds maybe we'd be more likely to read or such in other areas of the ship?  Not sure.

Quick question, hopefully able to get some answers. We're going on a Carnival cruise to the Caribbean in a few weeks, same port of departure and return.

We're in the process of trying to get a passport but we don't believe it will be here on time. We have a certified birth certificate, current state drivers license and certified marriage certificate all physically in our possession.

Example is...

Drivers license: **Jane Smith** (Smith being married surname)

Cruise,"Hello! I am somewhat of a beginner to cruises here (have only gone on 4 or so) so I was wondering if anybody might be able to suggest what a good first cruise would be for my wife, who has never been on one? 

It's just me and my wife. We are looking at any departure port from Florida since it's the closest to us and what I'm used to. We CAN look at other places to depart if the ship there would be REALLY worth it. Preferably we would like to drive there, and we are in South Carolina, so about a similar drive to Florida would be okay. We are planning a cruise of about a week but could do more. We will probably end up with a Caribbean cruise because that's just what's in Florida but don't really mind where we go. We have a fairly flexible budget, but obviously don't want to spend more than we need to, but if it's worth it we can spend a lil more. (trying not to spend over 5,000 on just booking alone) And we want it for summer, (can do up to september) since that's just when we like to spend our ocean-y vacations.

So right now I'm looking at Wonder of the Seas. Royal Caribbean is what I'm used to and am currently believing would be the ""best"" introduction to cruises, but like I said I'm inexperienced so I could be wrong. We are interested in other cruise lines from what we've seen (we really wanna try Virgin Voyages for example) but since I have no experience with them and my wife has never cruised, I am unsure and like I said, I want her to have a good experience on a first time cruise first to see if she would want to try other cruises in the future. Wonder of the Seas seems to have many things to do that she could enjoy, especially the shows. Though really, we're fine with having simple options like a pool available to lounge in when the mood strikes, or just having a place to watch a movie, things like that. 

The thing is the last cruise I went on was Harmony of the Seas about three years ago. I had a good experience overall, but I remember my time being specifically soured by crowds. I went in September but the pools were always chock full of kids and families so I never bothered to get in them even if I wanted to. At nights all the hot tubs were filled up with teenagers too. The lines just to get a snack by the pool were absurd. Excursions ended up just being a pain from the stress of the line of security. (I will probably opt out of excursions this time or limit them to only one) Also, people in crowds and the crowded pools tended to be openly and vocally rude, I guess about how I looked or cuz I had a pride tattoo or something, who knows lol. I feel like this kind of experience would be extremely bad for my wife. As she gets nervous in crowds and is especially insecure of being stared at. (she is trans) If people were this rude to me, a cis woman, I would worry quite a bit of how such an experience would affect her. She can handle crowds to some extent, but it's possible it could end up being too much.

So while a smaller ship would probably be ideal, and we are planning a late August booking, (right around the time when kids would start school, at least in Florida) I'm also afraid there wouldn't be as much to do. I'm wondering which is worth sacrificing more, less overcrowding or more things to do? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much, cruisers!",Suggestions on first cruise for semi crowd-fearing wife?,,LilyLaKoi,,0,2023-01-31 22:07:05
Cruise,"Hi all!

My husband and I are looking to book a cruise this December on the Celebrity Apex out of Ft Lauderdale. We're looking at prices right now, and there's not a ton of difference between the Concierge Class All Included fare and the AquaClass room.

First, I was wondering if the All Included fare is worthwhile. I did notice that the drink package that's included only covers drinks up to $10, which seems kind of low? On NCL, the basic drink package goes up to $15 (although it doesn't include coffee or bottled water, which I notice Celebrity does). Does this cover most drinks?

Second, is the Concierge Class worth it over the basic Verandah? How about the AquaClass over the Concierge Class? Is the actual concierge service decent? We do like a nice thermal suite, but there are only 2 at sea days, and we'll probably spend a decent amount of time off of the ship.

Cruise,"TLDR: Me and my fiance are going to pretend to get engaged for the first time on our cruise. How would you maximize the changes of us getting comped something? 

Me and my fiance are going to be going on a NCL cruise this summer. We've heard stories before about being given free stuff by cruise directors when something big happens on board. Like if you let the staff know it's your birthday, anniversary, honeymoon, etc. They might send you a bottle of champagne or comp a meal or something to that effect. Nothing crazy, but something big enough to either lock in repeat-cruisers (we've only used NCL once about 4 years back) or get to put on a public show of generosity. Or maybe because they're actually nice, but what are the odds of that, right?

We're already engaged, but we figure we may as well do a fake proposal on board and see if we get something. Current plan is to pick a public place when we're within earshot of the cruise director, or failing that, just the first night at dinner. We'll already have practiced our fake reactions.

We've narrowed it down based on price, dates, and itinerary to either the MSC Sinfonia or Virgin's brand new Resilient Lady (it will be her maiden voyage), and would love any advice from experienced cruisers. 

I've seen tons of negative MSC reviews, but most are pre-pandemic and for cruises in the Bahamas. I've seen tons of positive Virgin reviews, but obviously for different ships and different itineraries. It's a $1300 price difference for a balcony and free drinks (Virgin has a $600 tab offer, and that should realistically cover us). Both itineraries are almost the same, with only one full sailing day, so we don't anticipate needing a lot of entertainment or activities on the ship, and we'll really only be eating breakfast (maybe) and dinner on the ship, except for the one sailing day. 

We love the idea of adults-only, but we're wondering if it's risky to be on a maiden voyage (like when new restaurants open, I don't like to be the first guests because they usually have totally normal growing pains/kinks to work out). Is that a justified concern, or is Virgin pretty good right from the start?

Cruise,"My fiance and I are looking into cruises to take for our November honeymoon, and we are currently interested in two different cruises (these are currently the only two cruises that work with our timeframe that go to areas we are interested in):  
1) 14-Day ""Passage to America"" (Holland America Land) Rome -&gt; Fort Lauderdale, FL, which has a total of 8 days at sea, 5 of them all in a row (last leg of the trip to get to America)

2) 14-Day Mediterranean &amp; Israel (Princess) Rome -&gt; which only has a total of 3 days at sea.

This is my first time cruise (my fiances second), and I am super afraid of getting sea sick, so the second option seems better, but I'm afraid I will feel so exhausted with option 2. I know you don't have to get off the boat at every port, but it feels like a waste not to, especially since that cruise is stopping at so many historical, likely once-in-a-lifetime areas.

I loved all the build your own stations. However the MDR, not so much.  I'm sorry to say I'm beyond disappointed by the MDR food on Celebrity Summit. People talk trash about Carnival, but MDR on the Mardi Gras was a lot better. Plus carnival has several extra free dining options that are really good. Back to Celebrity, Most offerings were fish or chicken and the occasional flavorless roast pork, and the classic MDR thin steak. Part of the problem wasn't even the options, it was that everything was so very plain and bland tasting. The French onion soup is still great, but apart from that MDR was a big let down. They also got rid of the beef wellington. Even lobster night was sad, they brought out these tiny little lobster tails, and had the audacity to ask for $18.95 for extra orders. They did taste good, I'll give them that. As far as Tuscan Grille goes, their pasta and appetizer options are mostly good, some hit and miss, but if you order the 10oz ribeye, You're going to get the same thin sad steak you would get in the MDR just in ribeye form. Keep in mind it's $64.90 with tip per person to dine at Tuscan. What is the $55 going towards if not decent main entrees. I can get a steak 10 times better than that at outback for $25. I booked with Celebrity because everyone talked about how great their food was. I guess that was before Jan 1st?

Cruise,"Wife and I are going on a cruise Sunday. We're experimenting with not buying the booze package this time. Not that we go crazy with the booze package, but my brain tends to think, ""well, it wasn't cheap and the bar is right there, might as well..."" So, many mornings tend to be less fun than I'd like.

Yada yada, skipping the booze package. The plan is to buy drinks and just act like an adult. Also, the plan was to bring the 2 bottles per stateroom that we've long heard about but never tried (why bother when you have the booze package, right?)

So, I was looking to see if that was limited to 750ml (it is), but as it turns out, the FAQ says 2 bottles per guest, and I've found some online discussions have noticed this.

[https://www.celebritycruises.com/faqs/before-you-board](https://www.celebritycruises.com/faqs/before-you-board)

Some of the speculation is that Celebrity is pushing the ""all inclusive"" pretty hard, so letting more bottles on board may actually reduce the alcohol the cruise needs to pay for if people bring bottles they like from home, and non-booze package people may pay the corkage fee (we'll probably do that at dinner).

One concern brought up is that the people working the boat might not be aware of that policy.

Cruise,"Cruise Line: Norwegian

Ship: Breakaway

Port of Origin: New Orleans, LA

Itinerary: Western Caribbean, 7 days (Day 1 at-sea, Costa Maya, Harvest Caye, Roatan, Cozumel, Day 2 at-sea, New Orleans)

Pros:  Free-At-Sea package is a must.  All-inclusive drink package is incredible.  Two specialty dining meals in the package is phenomenal (paid for the additional two meal upgrade).  Staff was stellar and the balcony cabin in the package put the cherry on top.  Highly recommend the French restaurant Le Bistro.  

Cons:  Other cruisers.  For the meals we did not dine at the specialty restaurants we at the the Garden Cafe buffet which was great food quality-wise.  I told my girlfriend who I was with that I've seen better buffet etiquette at a Golden Corral or Old Country Buffet.  No one follows a general flow and people will cut in front of you, stand out in the middle of the walkway, and are generally pretty rude.  All around the ship no one seems to have any awareness of where they are standing and will block passageways without a care.  It got better as people spread out during the week but the first couple of days were pretty frustrating.  To top it all off, my girlfriend came out with Covid at the end of the cruise which is a bummer.  My guess is that there were people who knew they had it or at least knew they were sick when the came aboard.  My opinion, sure, but there were people in line before boarding that were clearly not feeling well.  Is what it is, I guess.

Excursions:  We did excursions at each port.  We went to the Kohunlich Mayan ruins in Costa Maya to start.  We're really into history and it was a great site.  The one downside is that it's a 2 hr bus ride from the port to the site so keep that in mind.  Overall very good.  Harvest Caye was a beach day.  Norwegian has it all to themselves and it was a nice chill day on a very beautiful beach.  Roatan was our favorite.  Highly recommend the Island Sightseeing and Beach tour.  Our tour guide was top shelf and she spared no detail on all things Roatan.  The excursion ended with about two hours at a very nice beach on the south side of the island.  Now that brings us to Cozumel.  Ugh.  First off, the weather was crappy.  Rained on us all day.  We booked the Tulum Mayan Ruins and was very much looking forward to it.  The ferry ride from Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen was rough.  My girlfriend got very seasick and she's been sailing for 30+ years on sailboats.  When we got to the mainland it was pouring and the walk from the pier to the busses are about 15 minutes.  When we finally got on the bus it was about an hour drive to the site.  During the bus ride the tour guides were trying to sell us on buying tacos and various jewelry.  Pretty low brow in my opinion.  When we finally got to the site it was a gauntlet of people trying to sell their wares before even getting to the ruins.  I've spent a lot of time in Mexico and am used to it so I wasn't surprised.  What was disappointing was that we only got about 45 minutes in the archaeological zone and was rushed back to the bus.  Upon returning back to Playa Del Carmen we were basically dropped off at a mall for about two hours before returning back to the ferry.  The ferry ride back to the ship was even more rough than the ride out.  I served in the Navy for 20 years and it was bordering on unsafe with the way the ferry was getting thrown around.  Crappy day all around.  Do not recommend that excursion even if the weather was nice.  I would recommend staying on Cozumel and avoid the ferry altogether.

Cruise,"First of all, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading on various opinions about the NCL upgrade advantage program and I think I understand the risks involved. But I‚Äôm still not sure what the best option is for me so I‚Äôm looking for a little (more) advice. 

I‚Äôll be going on my second cruise in March, out of NYC to the Bahamas for 8 nights, traveling with my mom. (She‚Äôs early 70‚Äôs, I‚Äôm early 40‚Äôs F.) For both of us, our first cruise was almost 10 years ago, also to the Bahamas on NCL, 4 days out of Miami. I booked this mostly as a way to get out of New England in the winter that was pretty reasonably priced compared to a week at a resort in Mexico, which was my (solo) escape last year. I was going to go by myself in a studio cabin, but the balcony rooms were very reasonably priced (our base price was $929 pp) so I invited my mom along and we booked just a few days ago. The itinerary wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice, since I‚Äôve already been to the Bahamas and Cape Canaveral doesn‚Äôt really interest me, but it‚Äôs certainly better than snow and freezing rain! 

My ideal vacation involves luxuriating by the ocean/pool, snorkeling, really anything involving water. Super loud parties are not our thing, and I tried to get us a cabin that wouldn‚Äôt be too near anything especially noisy. I settled on a family balcony room because a) it was roughly mid-ship and I‚Äôm worried about rough weather even though we‚Äôre not especially prone to seasickness b) I researched and found that deck 13 has all cabins both above and below and was a pretty desirable spot for a balcony. The other time I cruised we had an ocean view/porthole room so I‚Äôm excited about having our own balcony this time!

I got the email with the offer to upgrade to a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù room yesterday, and I‚Äôm considering making a bid for a spa balcony room (minimum $100 pp). I know the weekly passes for the thermal spa are $300 ish pp, so getting one for $100 would obviously be a great discount. (I have no idea the likelihood of getting it for the minimum though.) Since we‚Äôre sailing out on NYC in March and having multiple at sea days, I think we‚Äôd probably get a lot of use out of the spa passes. My mom may go into withdrawal over not having a bathtub for a week, so she would definitely love it, and I think we‚Äôd both appreciate it being adults only on top of all the spa features. 

Now I‚Äôve read the stories of people who bid on an upgrade and get it, only to find that the prices drop closer to sailing and they regret not just calling to see about getting an adjustment to the lower price. So I‚Äôve considered watching the prices, but all of the spa balconies were ‚Äúsold out‚Äù when I made the reservation, so I don‚Äôt have the option of starting a new booking to look at the current price of them. And I have no idea if the current prices are likely to drop further before sailing (&lt;50 days out), making it worthwhile to call and ask about an upgrade directly. I‚Äôm someone who really appreciates getting the best value for the money, and the spa is probably the best possible perk for us, but I‚Äôm a little wary of regretting the decision. I also know that the spa balconies are all on deck 14 fairly far forward, and I definitely don‚Äôt want to end up with something in an undesirable location. 

So I guess my questions are: Is it possible we could get a spa balcony for a minimum (or just over) bid? No way to tell how many of them are still available since they‚Äôre listed as sold out. Anybody have a bad experience with the spa balcony cabins? Too noisy/far away from things/etc? Are there ever any specials on the spa passes that would make it worth waiting? If I do want to call NCL directly, what would be the best way to inquire about getting a spa balcony for a good (~$100) price? Or is this a great offer that I‚Äôd be crazy not to jump at right now?

Thank you, and I‚Äôd also appreciate any other tips/tricks that are less well known than the ‚Äúfish swim to the front of the boat‚Äù and ‚Äúmake reservations early‚Äù variety!",Convince me (not) to bid on upgrade NCL Breakaway,,SmartPlenty4549,,0,2023-01-30 20:36:52

Pros:

1) Depart from Los Angeles, which is convenient for me, so I don't need to fly to the cruise port.

Cons:

1) More expensive than the **Celebrity Summit** itinerary 

2) Older than **Celebrity Summit,** as the staterooms and other public and private areas are not recently renovated.

Pros:

1) Cheaper cruise fare than the **Celebrity Solstice** itinerary

The kids are younger and, when looking at the ports (Spain, France, 3 in Italy), I'm curious if I'll even want to book excursions or if we should just head out and explore for the day. They've never been to Europe, so everything will be new to them and a day of walking, shopping, eating the like will likely be more fruitful than booking an expensive excursion.

A couple questions - for those that have taken the family on these trips before, what option did you choose? Are there cities that would benefit more from a guided tour than others, ie Rome due to the size?

And lastly, is it recommended I book the trains into the cities myself (Florence, Rome) or do it via the cruise options?

Ports are Mallorca, Marseilles, Florence, Rome and Naples.

Cruise,"My husband and I just disembarked our first NCL cruise on the Breakaway today from New Orleans. The cruise was okay, but we probably won't be cruising with NCL again. 

The ship had a sewage smell going on in alot of places. Some of the public restrooms smelled bad like pee and the pool deck sometimes smelled like vomit. 

The food in the MDR was so bland that we only ate there for two of our seven nights and chose the buffet instead. We tried Moderno and wasn't impressed. The salad bar was good, but meat and sides weren't great. I consider myself a junk food connoisseur so for me to not like the quality of food is saying something lol.

The drink package was good. The bars were constantly very busy, but the servers and bartenders were doing great keeping up. Unfortunately, NCL is really overworking their staff especially the bartenders. You could tell at times they were drowning. The ship was packed at full capacity. 

We thought the shows were great! The adult comedy shows and magic shows were our faves. We also really enjoyed the Waterfront. We had booked an interior cabin so having a nice outdoor space to retreat to was a perk. 
We also booked the thermal spa for the week and it was our saving grace to get away from the hustle and bustle of the crowded areas.

The one thing I'm puzzled about is our room steward. He never cleaned our room for the entire 7 night cruise. We had to put dishes and dirty towels outside of our room at the door. He saw us doing it and never offered to come and clean the room. He would just pick them up after we walked away. We had to take clean towels and toilet paper from the spa to get by. Our trash was overflowing when we left. I  saw him constantly cleaning the suites across from us and was sort of annoyed that therein rooms stayed spotless and we couldn't even get our toilet cleaned. I didn't mention anything because I don't want to get any staff in trouble, but it just seemed kind of shitty. I usually leave a great tip for the room steward at the end of the cruise, but just couldn't do it this time.

Cruise,"* Ship: Ruby Princess
* Ports: Cozumel, Belize City, and Roatan
* Round trip from Galveston, TX; 7 days total

I traveled with my boyfriend and our two best friends, who are a married couple. My boyfriend and I are late 20s and our friends are early 30s. The occasion was for the wife's 30th birthday, which fell in December but is very near Christmas, so she chose to celebrate it with a trip in January and my boyfriend and I asked if we could tag along. She picked this cruise because it was apparently $10 cheaper than the other cruise leaving port at the same time and she read that Princess had the best food. 

It's important that I emphasize this point: I am a pretty type-B person. I went into this with *literally zero expectations* and *planned/researched almost nothing ahead of time* and I still had a great time. I also learned a lot and have a lot of thoughts and opinions about what I'd do differently were I to cruise again. I hope my decompression thoughts help another first time cruiser. 

* Arrival was extremely easy and went smoothly. We drove down from Austin the morning of, pretty early, and had lunch in Galveston before we found our parking lot and boarded. We'd completed our onboarding documentation ahead of time on the app and I would encourage others to do the same - we didn't have to wait in any lines and basically got to walk onto the boat from the time we got dropped off by the parking shuttle to the time we were on the boat. The muster process was virtual and very easy.
* The ship vibes gave me ""an older boat that was once extremely nice, has been well maintained, but is definitely not modern anymore."" Everything was clean, everything worked perfectly, and it was all Nice(tm), but just kind of old. Think wood paneled walls, goofy hotel carpeting patterns, just kind of...chintzy. 
* This segues into the next heavily vibes-impacting factor: this particular cruise ship's demographic. To be blunt: this cruise was old as hell. My friends and I were easily some of the youngest people on the entire boat, besides literal children. If you're a frequent cruiser you might be thinking ""duh, you dumb bitch, schools are in session, and Princess is an older cruise line"" but this didn't even cross my mind before we traveled, so I wanted to spell this out very clearly for anyone who might be reading this who is like me. If you want to cruise in January in the offseason and are a young person, are party- or nightlife-minded, or just want something fresher and more modern, keep this in mind.
* The entertainment and the vibes followed the demographic of the ship: just generally geared towards older people. Again, if you're a seasoned cruiser, you're still probably thinking ""duh, you dumb bitch"" but I tried to go into this with little to no expectations so it was all brand new to me. Most people ate early and the dining rooms seemed packed at 5 PM. The nightlife was pretty tame but still enjoyable: trivia, bingo, movies, etc. There wasn't a lot of stuff like silent discos - think more ""live pianist in a lounge while people play cards."" The birthday girl in our party was really into all the programming and we tagged along to most of it, but we also spent a lot of time on the decks reading, drinking, and chilling and played a lot of Trivial Pursuit and Scattergories, which was fine with me. We unexpectedly really enjoyed the game shows put on by the cruise director staff but as word got out about how fun they were, the harder it got to get seats in the lounges they took place in and we had to stand for both of the last two. Our friends that we were traveling with weren't interested in the nightclub or the casino (or really staying up late at all), but my boyfriend and I were able to make friends with some other young people and we tried out the club a few times. The club was, as you might expect from the cruise ship's demographic, not crowded, but I thought the DJ was funny and played fun music. I didn't think the comedian was very funny but the crowd seemed to like him. We didn't attend any of the singing or dancing style shows. I thought the movie options each day were pretty good and I appreciated that they showed the NFL games the first Sunday we were at sea. 
* The food and dining experience was really good! We made reservations each night for the same time and I do recommend this. If you do this and want to change your reservation or show up earlier, we learned that it's better to talk to them in advance instead of change it in the app - the first time we changed it in the app, they seemed completely unprepared for us and asked us to just come early and ask in person. The next nights we did just go early and were always walked right to our same table with minimal, if any, wait. We really enjoyed having the same waitress each night, too - she was very kind and pleasant, and we were able to get to know her by seeing her each night. The food itself was similar to the same vibes as the whole ship - nothing extremely modern or experimental, but always correct and tasty. They served lots of classic, old-fashioned stuff: think duck a l'orange, beef Wellington, etc. I *loved* the fun freedom of getting to get a slice of pizza or a soft serve on the deck. We never ate in any of the other restaurants because we never felt a need to - the food in the main dining rooms was just fine for us. I also liked the free room service and enjoyed being able to order like, a Coke to my room when I had a headache, or a drink to a random lounge. 
* The ports were the area that I wish I had researched the most. I followed my boyfriend's guidance about the excursions and the ports because he had been on a Caribbean Princess cruise about 10 years before as a senior in high school with family and friends. (He is also relatively type B and we were both looking for a relaxing vacation and were open to being flexible.) This meant that we didn't have a plan for the port days, and it unsurprisingly turned out that 10 years ago and being a drunk high schooler at the time made his recollections foggy. He made it seem like it was a) easier to book excursions last minute if we wanted to and b) easy to go to a beach or relaxation spot if we didn't like the excursions. This was really not the case, and I would encourage anyone who is easygoing like me and didn't want to book excursions ahead of time to have at least some plan on each port day, or be willing to be flexible. The beaches on each port were only really accessible by taxi trip, not an easy walk. We mostly wandered around each port, ate and drank, and then got back on the boat. In Cozumel this was fine and we did find a cheap private snorkel tour that was great fun (the guide didn't speak any English and the boat was ratty but the snorkeling was great), but in Belize City I ended up getting pretty disappointed that we didn't book an excursion. Belize City is not very developed, Belize itself is an impoverished nation, and once we left the very small port there was not much to do at all. This might have ruined the day had I not been able to shake it off and be flexible, but we regrouped, had a chill lunch and a Belikin, and then got back on the boat. The next day was Roatan and I really wanted to have a beach day so we did plan and execute that, and I'm glad of it. We found a very kind taxi driver to take us to the West Bay of the island and he picked us up again for $120 USD round trip for four people. Roatan was beautiful and the beach was scenic. We roughed it on our towels in the sand just fine (no major sunburns!) but if you wanted a beach chair with an umbrella it would have been about $15-$20 USD for the whole day. 
* Minor other tips, tricks, and thoughts - I had no idea about the lack of outlets in the staterooms and that was annoying. I wish we'd booked a room with a window if only for better Circadian rhythm syncing - the lack of natural light really fucked with my ability to wake up each morning and I'm sure my boyfriend felt like he was waking the dead each day. There were two formal dining nights and I really enjoyed getting dressed up. There was more room to unpack than I expected and I was glad I took the time to do that. There were a few little touches that were old fashioned that I actually really liked (they give damp towels and water out when you get back on the boat from the ports, extremely clutch on a hot day). My only minor complaints with dining were that sometimes it seemed like they occasionally lost us using the Medallion system (we ordered drinks a couple of times that were marked delivered but never found us) and that it seemed kind of hard to just get water to drink on this ship. I'm a millennial - I like to drink water! I brought a large reusable cup for the trip but it was kind of a pain to have to go up to the food court to fill up the cup each time I wanted more water to drink than one single glass at a time from the bar. I should have been bolder about asking the bartenders to give me larger glasses to drink or filling up my cup for me. The afternoon tea on Friday was extremely fun and the scones were delicious. My boyfriend and I did not get the Internet or the drinks package and I don't regret not getting it - I'm the bigger drinking of the two of us and even I think I only *averaged* maybe four alcoholic drinks a day, one specialty coffee, and a handful of sodas. 

This is all I could think of as a true first-timer who didn't prepare very much. In summary, great vacation, would cruise again, but would probably do more research next time about excursions and would maybe book a newer/more modern ship or go at a time of year with more young people.",A type B true cruise rookie's very thorough review and recap of her first ever cruise,,saradactyl25,,0,2023-01-30 00:17:22

I've even been told ""You're supposed to walk on the right""

Which, seems strange to me given the majority walk on the left.

I mean, obviously as a cruise that left Australia, we do most things on the left, drive on the left, pass on the left, feed the ducks on the left, etc. So it stands to reason that you would walk on the left.

I feel if we sailed out of the USA, more people would walk on the right, so that's where the flow would be.

But I'm curious how others feel.

I narrowed it down with the types of boats I‚Äôm really after - which are either the new Celebration or the Horizon. With my research, they look pretty comparable and think I‚Äôll be happy with both. 

6 day on the Carnival Horizon - 
Miami &gt; Ocho Rios, Jamaica &gt; Grand Cayman &gt; Cozumel Mexico &gt; Miami (days 2 &amp; 6 are at sea) 

7 day on the Carnival Celebration -
Miami &gt; Amber Cove, Dominican Republic &gt; San Juan, Puerto Rico, &gt; St Maarten, British Islands &gt; Miami (days 2, 6, &amp; 7 are at sea) 

There‚Äôs also the same itinerary for the 7 day for another cruise but just goes to St Thomas US islands, rather than St Maarten but think I ruled it out because St Maarten is more appealing to me, but if you have an option on those two islands lmk.  

There‚Äôs about a $400 difference between the two. The two different boats don‚Äôt seem to be a huge factor, but if the ports on the 7 night are really that much worth it to spend the extra money I will.

This group was not mentioned anywhere in the booking process until I received my final email confirmations and now I have no idea what to do.

Cruise,"Good day all. My GF and I are booked on our first cruise together (Her first ever cruise and my 5th but its been years since my last) in February. I had some concerns about my flights and wanted advice on connections and anything we can do to make the trip there a success. This is the first time I have had to worry about connections on holidays as we usually fly a more direct route and its to a hotel type resort not a set time cruise.

We booked a week in the Caribbean with Norwegian on the Prima and purchased the included flights deal as it worked out cheaper then booking our own flights. 

My concern is the the flights prior to the cruise we are slated to land in Orlando on the morning of the cruise at 6 am so there is a little room for error but not for missing connections which is my issue.

The Flights they booked start the afternoon of the day before where we will fly from our small city to Calgary international where we only have 1hr 40 min to catch our connection to LAX then we get 1hr 30 min to catch our flight to Orlando.

This seems to be pushing it for time on the flights so I wanted to see if anyone had advice for going thru these airports.

Cruise,"We are planning to go on a family cruise in 2024 to celebrate some of our family members important milestone. Last night I was given the dates and they want to do Royal Symphony of the Seas.

I‚Äôve only sailed NCL (multiple times) and like how the pricing is much more straightforward. From what I am seeing on this particular sailing, it‚Äôs around $2k per adult and that doesn‚Äôt include a drink package or anything. 

Do you purchase that on the ship?

This pricing is for a balcony room and it feels like a lot but we are also sailing in the height of the summer.

I was looking at pics of the interior rooms and they look much more spacious than NCL interior rooms. We normally sail balcony but for the price Royal charges I am thinking it makes much more sense to do interior since nothing is even added to the base price yet.

Please let me know of any other differences between the 2 lines I should know about. 

This is a Bahamas sailing which we‚Äôve done several times on NCL already.  

I think my family likes the idea of Royal‚Äôs private island for the kids.

Our options are:

- direct flight at 7PM the night before, gets to Fort Lauderdale at 11PM, hotel (Jet Blue)

- direct flight that arrives at 10AM day of cruise, so 4 hours to spare (no checked bags), first flight of the day on that route (southwest)

-connecting flights, and I am not about to get stuck in some random city 

This is in late February in Nashville. Statistically, weather has a 1% chance of being a problem. My thinking is, if weather is an issue, how likely is it that the JetBlue flight ‚Äúthe day before‚Äù would make it while the Southwest flight the next morning wouldn‚Äôt?

I am big on hiking, so whichever one I don't choose I will find some trails or something to go and explore, so that may be a consideration as well, if one of these ports are much better for hiking then kayaking.

I know in this case, drinks/tips/wifi wouldn't be included like it usually is for Aquaclass, but does anyone know from experience if we would still get access to the thermal suite included? Or any special spa stuff when getting Aquaclass as an offer?
2. The drink packages are crazy, for the basic one it's like over $1000 for 2 people on a week cruise. I also gamble a lot and I know Celebrity gives drinks out to people playing in the casino. But I drink a lot too and would love the drink package. Has anyone ever gotten buddy-buddy with the casino host and been offered these types of perks while on the cruise? It was alleged to me they have a budget per cruise for things like this. If I do get friendly with the host, would it be inappropriate to bluntly ask?
3. Anyone who has ranked up through Blue Chip Club, it sounds like you automatically get a free cruise offer when reaching Onyx.

I'd never heard of this policy on any line so I was surprised and asked her to clarify. She did.

Cruise,"My parents are celebrating their 40th anniversary this year and want to go on their first cruise this year. The (adult) kids want to join. After some preliminary filtering (mom wants 6-8 days, embark and disembark at American poets, New England and Canada itinerary), it appears we‚Äôve narrowed it down to either:
-Princess (Emerald) 7-day Canada and New England, round trip out of New York
-Royal Caribbean (Serenade) 7-Day Canada cruise, round trip out of Boston

There are a couple of RC 9-day cruises that are kind of in the running, but it‚Äôs harder for everyone to get out of work. 

Demographics of the travelers:
-Parents (early 60s)
-Son 1 and spouse (early 30s)
-Son 2 and spouse (late 20s)
-Son 3 and spouse (mid 20s)
Small chance my sister comes with her 5 y/o, but unlikely. 

Son 1 has done Alaska (HAL) and Mediterranean (NCL). Son 2 has done Mexico (Carnival). Everyone likely will buy a balcony room.

Generally, we like to eat and hang out, but we‚Äôre not really partiers (though we are Italian). Would only have a drink or two a day. Mostly looking for relaxation, good food, interesting shows (the nerdy shit on HAL, for example), and a smooth ride. Everyone is healthy, able to walk long distances, up for everything from ghost tours to go carts to zip lining to hiking to visiting breweries. 

Both RC and Princess seem like great options to me. Cruisecritic (I know, I know) seems to rate these similarly, and it‚Äôs hard to differentiate.

I rarely post on reddit especially when I reference the higher end ""Ship-Within-A-Ship"" experience I have.  Yet I write on social media all the time about how to get as much value from your cruising experience. Also, how to enhance your cruising experience with realistic expectations.

The second cruise showed a significant negative change in all of those areas.  The last cruise was even worse.  The cruise line cutbacks are significant which is surprising because the costs have gone up.  

My challenge is if the cost goes up and the quality goes down, how can I or anyone else justify the product.  Why does a reduction in quality in products and services have to happen.  I am disappointed and want to know if I am the only one with this experience.

Cruise,"
I'm considering going on a cruise, but I'm a first timer.

Just looking for information/advice please:

- I'm a 29 Male here, is there cruises for younger people, or are they generally mixed age ranges?

- Does the Cruise line matter facility wise, package wise, entertainment wise etc?

- A horror story, that puts me off of cruises, is if illness breaks out, they quarantine/isolate the ship. But why spend all that money to sit in your room? Is there protections on getting refunds for this outcome?

- I've been reading that WiFi is separate, no problem, I think it would be nice to have no WiFi so I can truly relax without the worry of my phone pinging, but I could easily download books/Netflix stuff beforehand if I wanted to.

- How strict is the dress code? I'm not into super fancy meals with black tie stuff, never have been really.

- With the excursions offered in the port or on the cruise ship, what if I decided I didn't want to go on one? Are the ports usually near active areas or close enough by public transport?

- I see that some company's offer an All Inclusive drinks package, is this worth it?

- If visas are necessary at each port, can I get them, there and then? Or do I have to have had sorted it beforehand?

- Any recommendations on where to go and how long for as a first timer?

Cruise,"I am very interested in Virgin, which seems to tick a lot of my boxes--great food, pretty much all-inclusive minus booze, chill vibes, no kids.  Plus, the appeal of cruising for me is the ship experience rather than the itinerary (which most people view as VV's weak point).  But there are still a couple of things I am not sure about, mostly about the basic day-to-day experience.

1. I really enjoyed spending hours in the pool reading my Kindle every day.  It seems like the VV pools are much smaller--could I still comfortably read in them?  Are there other places to read in the water?  Do I need to get a suite to get a bathtub?
2. What did an average day look like in terms of activities?  I liked the variety on RCI--live music, trivia, shows (even if somewhat corny), etc.  My sense is that VV has more pop-up entertainment and small-scale performances.  Did that work for you?  What did a standard day at sea involve?
3. How raunchy was the experience?  I am probably more prudish than average, and I don't know whether the cunnilingus-named ice cream shop, the sex-themed show, and the sex toy box thing in the room reflect the general vibe/tenor on board.

Cruise,"Went on a cruise with Royal Caribbean last month. While at the buffet one morning pouring my coffee, the nozzle of the dispenser unexpectedly slipped and squirted scalding coffee all over my hand, causing severe burns. Upon returning later, it became apparent that the locking mechanism of the dispenser was not locked, which would have prevented it from twisting in the first place.

Talked to several of the staff there, and they all acknowledged that it was their mistake. However, returned to inspect other coffee dispensers later on, and came to realize that about 1/3 of them had their nozzles in the unlocked position. After bringing this up to one of the floor managers, they were shocked that such little care was going in to locking the mechanisms so that their customers could safely pour their own coffee.

Days ago I got a phone call from Royal Caribbean, saying that after reviewing my case, there was no instance of employee negligence, and that the company acted responsibly on the matter, since the medical facility on board treated my burn. However, as a gesture of goodwill, they offered me a credit of $153 dollars to be used toward any Royal Caribbean cruise within the next 1 year. They made it clear with me that they were not obligated to do this nice gesture, and that if I would agree, to please sign the release form.

I asked them about the nature of this form. ""Does it restrict my legal capabilities in any way?"", I asked. ""No, if you choose to sue Royal Caribbean, that is entirely up to you"". I found this to be an odd thing to say, so I checked into the release that they sent me, and sure enough, it was buried somewhere in the legal verbiage that ""by accepting this, you release and forever discharge ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD., its affiliates liable or who might be claimed to be liable"".

So this is the behaviour of the world's biggest cruise ship line. Suffice to say, if you suffer personal injury or harm on board a Royal Caribbean cruise, you are pretty much on your own.

Cruise,"We booked with Viking and in 10 minutes on this subreddit I'm learning we already screwed up (flights through the cruise line).

But my question is about getting hit with a cancellation fee.

We booked 4 people on our cruise. 3 of us are related. The 4th is one of our co-workers. A week before the full payment due the co-worker cancelled. (They didn't even tell us... they only told the cruise and not even in writing so it wasn't official) Sooo that sucked.

Then we replace the passenger ourselves and are sent an invoice for a cancellation fee. And now we're really pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

* We're being charged a cancellation fee because someone else cancelled?
* The representative we spoke to understood how it wasn't fair but wouldn't do jack to reverse or reduce the charge. Same with their supervisor. You could tell that the supervisor never reversed a charge in their life and was proud of it.
* But there's some things we still don't understand. Like what do they do if a person books alone and cancels? Wouldn't they go after the fee from that person? If so why aren't they doing that in this scenario?
* The 3 of us purchased travel insurance. The 4th who bailed said they didn't want the insurance because they were sure they wouldn't cancel. What is super frustrating is that the cancellation fee is 2x what the travel insurance was. It would have been better for us to buy the travel insurance on their behalf! We would have saved a ton of money! The supervisor wouldn't agree to reduce the fee to the price of the travel insurance either, which would have been reasonable.
* They could not justify the $700 fee. We understand if flights and whatever else had been purchased under that persons name, but none of that has happened yet. We haven't even got to the deadline for guest documentation nor full payment. So there's nothing on their end they would even do at this point other than change a name on the booking.

So I guess my questions are:

1. Is this normal?
2. We agreed to the cancellation fee for ourselves, but we never agreed to pay a cancellation fee for someone else. Is this allowed or are they taking advantage of the situation and sticking us with the bill instead of someone they know won't pay?
3. If someone books alone and has not paid in full (down payment only) what would the cruise do? And why aren't they doing the same thing here?
4. What options do we have to fix this crap?

This is really souring the whole trip before it even starts. It's very tempting to cut our losses and book somewhere else properly.",I'm a newb and need help to see if this is normal (whack cancellation fee),,jadin-,,0,2023-01-20 22:57:07

3. How worried should we be of transmissible diseases?  Covid has pretty well settled here at home, but we don't have any idea what to expect on a boat. Are all areas of the ship open to the public, or are some common areas closed off? 
4. Any advice as to which destinations and cruiselines that would be idea for bringing a baby? I think our favourites back in the day were Celebrity and Princess, while we weren't fans of Holland America (could have changed, though in the time we've been away).

Cruise,"Hi y‚Äôall! Long time lurker, first time poster!

So I‚Äôm not much of a gambler. I used to work in a riverboat casino and after spending too much time holding the hands of people who really needed to be going to GA meetings, I lost any pretense that I could ever make a profit from the slots or tables. Having said that, I do occasionally enjoy spending time in casinos in a transactional kind of way. For example, I went to a casino hotel in a big tourist spot recently because it was the least expensive hotel. I had an attached offer for dinner for 2 and a nice other couple of things if I gambled an amount that was less than the dinner, plus I got a couple of free drinks for my time while playing. I‚Äôm not a gambler, but I am a discount hunter so I was willing to spend that amount in the casino to get something else that I wanted at a steep discount. (Think $50 of play to get a $100 dinner, if numbers make it make sense. It really was a low ‚Äústeaks‚Äù situation (haha, I kill me).

I‚Äôm currently in the very very early planning stages for what will likely be a Caribbean vacation. I‚Äôm not the type to gamble, but again I am transactional. If I‚Äôm not being too personal, how much did you gamble before you started receiving comp offers for free/heavily discounted cruises? I know if the casino thinks they‚Äôll keep making money on me they‚Äôll pay for me to be on board, and from the tales I see in here it‚Äôs kind of like a gift that keeps on giving once you spend the right amount. 

I don‚Äôt want to count on being a winner, but I know it happens. I‚Äôm fully expecting to spend $XXX in the casino with a goal of receiving $XXX in future cruises in return. I just want to know if the X is a realistic number for my particular budget, and if it works out to actually be a savings if you play your cards right by losing.

Cruise,"I have never been on a cruise but have been planning on taking one with my significant other this April. Neither of us have ever gone on a cruise and since we are both young budget does play a huge part in our choice. After countless hours of browsing we narrowed down our options to two  


**Choice 1: 2500$ Norwegian Cruise Package with a room with no window**  


**Choice 2: 1300$ MSC Cruise Package with a balcony**  


At first it seemed like a no brainer 1200$ less and you get much more... but after reading reviews on this thread, Expedia, and Travelocity I am more confused then when I started. How can a cruise line be so good but at the same time so bad? How can people say the food is on par with Royal Caribbean, while others say that they wish they hadn't eaten for a week instead. Is it just people finding things to look to complain for or is there actually just such a big inconsistency in MSC Service?  


Are there any recent cruisers with MSC that can shed some light on my decision please. Preferably if you took the **Meraviglia** out of New York. Do I just risk it and get the cheaper cruise, or pay 1.2K extra for the guarantee that our food won't be bad? Thank you so much for your time!  


**TLDR:** MSC is 1200$ cheaper than its competitor and on paper offers more. Is it really bad, or should I say screw it and just book it for 1300$ and make the most out of it?",First Time Cruiser Tempted By MSC Cruise. Is It Really That Bad?,,WhiteWiesslogia,,0,2023-01-20 04:25:06
Cruise,"I'm going on a 7 day cruise next month on Norwegian Escape. The package I got comes with 150 minutes of wifi. I'm a little worried because while it sounds like a lot, I imagine those minutes go by fast when you are using it. I also worry if the wifi is really slow, then I'll be using a lot of minutes just to get pages to load and things to send.

I don't need my phone for a lot, I'm on vacation so obviously I'd like to keep usage to a minimum. Honestly the main thing I want to make sure I have it  for is to keep my snapchat streaks. That's as simple as a quick picture and send every day, assuming the wifi is good enough to send snaps. So that shouldn't take much time. And I'd like to be able to check in with my friends everyday and just send a couple messages to some people, and quickly check the email daily just to make sure nothing important. 

So does anyone have experience with wifi on Norwegian? Did you find 150 minutes enough? Do apps like snapchat work fine with it? How does it work? Do you just sign in to the wifi and can use any app and just have to disconnect when you are done? 

Also, do ports usually have some free wifi that you can connect to?

Cruise,"My parents (70s) and my partner and I (38) just got off a 10 day Oceania cruise. It was my first cruise ever and their second, so I‚Äôm not sure how it compares to other lines and in which ways. 

Things we liked:

-	casual dress code, as in no ties required anywhere
-	almost all amenities available to all cabin levels. I think only the spa deck with the fancy hot tub was restricted to concierge and up passengers
-	freedom to dine anywhere at at times and bring food wherever
-	very few kids
-	daily string quartet performances in the main lounge
-	total lack of nickel-and-diming on board‚Äîalcohol, spa treatments, and excursions were the only things not included in the base price
-	comfortable, modern rooms with nice verandas

Thus my parents weren‚Äôt a fan of:

-	Size. Our ship held 1250 passengers, which is obviously small, but service felt impersonal (although very, very polished)
-	Other passengers‚Äîit was all snooty boomers who didn‚Äôt seem interested in socializing outside of their group and seemed to treat the staff like trash
-	The kind of general obsequiousness of the staff. My parents (socialist college professor and former nun/retired social worker) hate being treated like ‚Äúrich people‚Äù and like to chit chat with their servers etc. The staff all acted very much like ‚Äúthe help.‚Äù

TLDR: everything was very nice and very high quality, but also a bit much. 

Oh and about the food since that‚Äôs Oceania‚Äôs thing: it was good. It was all very high quality with different menus every day in the two main dining rooms. They handled allergies extremely well. Unlimited fillet mignon and lobster tail were available in every restaurant and 24 hours a day through room service. All of the specialty restaurants were excellent. As a former food person, however, my only complaints were that everything seemed tailored to 80 year olds from Kansas who think cumin is exotic and a fillet mignon is better than a ribeye. There weren‚Äôt really many interesting choices and not a single thing was spicy. (They were able to do a decently spicy Thai curry when I requested it though.) Overall I‚Äôd say 10/10 for quality, variety, and presentation, and 3/10 for originality, which is probably exactly what their customer base is looking for.

I also was looking online and saw additional restaurants (Eatly) that are not classified as speciality or included. Can anyone speak to these other options highlighted ? I was also curious how much extra the food at the oyster bar is? 

I also was wondering if tips are included when you pay? I have seen some posts on here about getting hit with a big bill but I think I already paid tips when booking. 

For bars, I purchased the premium package (up to $15 per drink) and I was wondering does that work everywhere onboard aside from the chocolate shop? I wanted to verify it would work at the places onboard including speciality dining. 

My next step of questions is on the excursions available. We will be stopping in Nassau, Ocean Cay, costa Maya, and Cozumel. For Nassau we will be swimming with dolphins and for Ocean Cay we will be doing the set ski tour. We will be going to Blue Lagoon for the dolphins. Is this better than balmoral island? Also which ruins out of the ones valuable at costa maya or Cozumel is better? 

Lastly‚Ä¶ for theme nights‚Ä¶. Seems like two formal nights and possibly a night party is all I need to prepare for based on research. Can anyone speak to this?

Cruise,"We booked a last-minute cruise on Princess that sets sail the last week of February. It's a closed-loop itinerary from Fort Lauderdale with stops at Princess Cays, St. Maarten, and St. Thomas. My husband and I both have passports, but my husband's passport expires 5 months after the cruise, not 6. We (of course) checked the travel documents requirements before booking the last-minute sailing since we knew his passport was under 6 months from expiry, and Princess's guidelines say that a passport isn't required for closed-loop Caribbean itineraries unless they stop in Martinique or Gaudeloupe. I confirmed this with a customer service rep, and we do have a birth certificate and driver's license as backup. Neither the Bahamas nor St. Maarten even has a 6 month requirement, so even if we were to get stranded, he could fly home on his current passport.

There's plenty of variations of this, where someone talks about their experience on a resort line and someone criticizes them for not going on a $6k 100 passenger ultra luxury line. 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and it makes perfect sense that some people strongly prefer the ultra premium lines. It's totally cool to express that!

However, there's a difference between expressing your preference and disparaging someone because they can't afford an ultra premium line.

My family and I just completed our first cruise on Disney and to say we caught the cruising bug would be an understatement. 

We love Disney and thought the experience was great but also recognize that there is a premium that comes with Disney's brand and experiences (It was awesome seeing so many characters on the ship). 

Just because of the price we are open to exploring other cruise lines as alternatives to Disney but one major concern we have is the fact that we have young children (currently 1 and 4). On Disney the kids clubs were AMAZING. At dinner on the first night our 1 year old fell asleep (at like 6:30) and we were able to take him to the Small World Nursery on board while we enjoyed the entertainment and nightlife. 

We expect Disney to be great for families (even those with small children) but I have no clue what to expect on other lines.

Cruise,"I‚Äôve never seen a cruise ship so poorly organized. I‚Äôm on the NCL Encore right now for my honeymoon, and with peace and love this ship is a hot mess. God bless the employees doing their best.

The first day, the muster drill was complete chaos. Nothing was clearly labeled for where people should go. They went around to everyone‚Äôs tables telling them to go to the drill since it was starting in 15 minutes, and we had to ask a crew member where it even was because there was no signage. When we went to that deck, the area was so crowded that we were packed like sardines, trying desperately to find whichever person had the sign for where we needed to end up. We were on deck 6, and our station was D2, but literally there were only signs that said D. We had no idea what was going on, and it was a dangerous situation. Then when we FINALLY got to the correct section, we were reprimanded by the leader guy for having been there too early before they were ready and that‚Äôs why it was chaotic. Even though they specifically told us to get up and go. You‚Äôd think the ship would just have actual signs and directions for muster stations, but that would be too easy. Then we were yelled at for being on our phones (while waiting for it to start) by the leader with big middle manager energy, and he was so combative and unprofessional. He made sure we knew his name was Alexis.

There was some other tomfoolery on board since my husband had special dietary needs and there was confusion about when/where to pre-order his meals. But what was ridiculous was that at the first port at Great Stirrup Cay, they had only three tender boats taking everyone back, leading to a massive line to get back on the ship. How were they surprised that thousands of people were trying to come back at the designated time? Maybe it‚Äôs because there was another Norwegian ship at that particular port with us, but it was still truly ridiculous. The employees were super nice and making sure to hand out refreshments for those in line so no one would get dehydrated, but it was more of a bandaid on the situation.

(As a bonus, this ship is always rocking and rolling. Idk if it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs constantly a huge amount of wind, but I‚Äôve never felt a large ship with so much movement!)

This is truly the ratchetest cruise I‚Äôve ever been on, and I‚Äôve been on the day cruise to Freeport twice. I will definitely not be traveling with NCL ever again. I used to work at the Port of Miami checking in the NCL guests, and I guess this place had to come back to haunt me one last time.

Cruise,"Hello r/Cruise, I just got off MSC Seascape and a lot of you have had questions, concerns, and gripes, with MSC so I decided to write this trip review!

For some background, this was my 6th cruise (1 Celebrity, 1 Princess, 2 Royal, 2 MSC), and my previous experience with MSC in 2016 was poor, however, I decided to give them a shot because brand new ship with a free balcony upgrade and $200 onboard credit is hard to say no to.

The Food:

I kept a daily journal of the food on board but I won't post that because it's too long. 

* The breakfast buffet was pretty solid, the made-to-order omelet and the cinnamon pecan rolls were a must for me every morning. 
* The lunch buffet was where the food fell a bit flat, every day it was the same food with minor changes and most of it was pretty bland, however, one day I did find Ropa Vieja which was very good, and another day they had Butter Chicken alongside other Indian dishes which looked very appetizing and I regret not trying. The pizza is always a safe bet. Burgers were okayish except for the bread which was always overtoasted/dry.
* For lunch on our day at sea, we opted in to eat at Kaito Sushi, a specialty restaurant that does conveyor belt sushi. Normally the way the restaurant works is that plates come in different colors corresponding to different prices. Luckily for us though, on the day of our reservation, the restaurant was having a special which was all-you-can-eat in 45 minutes for $33 per person including dessert. It was pretty good. Our tab would have definitely been over $60 per person with all that we ate.
* We had dinner every night in the dining room. The food was very good. Yes, the bread was cold (if you get that reference), but that doesn't detract from the experience. Standouts from the dining room include Slow Roasted Prime Rib, Jerk Pork Salad, Lamb Curry, Key Lime Pie (better than any I've had in Florida), Coconut Ice Cream, Lobster Bisque, Steak Tartare, Bouillabaisse Proven√ßal, Cabernet-Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Shank, Crab Cakes, Coconut Tapioca Pudding, Limoncello Cake, and Tiramisu. For me, the best dish in the dining room was the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle, I am still thinking about it.

The Bad (and the Good):

* I remember seeing someone on reddit complaining about the size of the water cups and I must agree, they are very small and it's inconvenient when the water stations at the buffet are so few, very spread out, and are usually crowded.
* The water is very good, if you've had desalinated water, you can tell it's desalinated water, but the desal taste is barely noticeable. In addition, the water did wonders to my hair and skin, I dread going back to Florida's crusty, crunchy, hard water.
* The temperature of the jacuzzis is very low? The water felt near or slightly above body temperature, which really sucked on the day we were at sea because the wind was very strong and cold, we just wanted to warm up a bit :(
* The jacuzzis on deck 8 are my favorite, they're so neat for when you're arriving or leaving a port.
* Getting around cruise ships is usually a tricky task, Seascape makes things more complicated, it has a lot of dead ends, most are because public areas end and Yacht Club/crew area begins, but others are some weird design choices. Something I didn't realize until my second day at sea was that there isn't a single deck (excluding the ones that are only staterooms) where you can go from bow to aft without having to backtrack or go up/down to a different deck. tl;dr: no running/jogging track.
* Le Cabaret Rouge is the best venue onboard, the performances there are better than at the Chora Theater.
* The shows at the Chora Theater are weak, the shows tend to be very similar but the performers are dressed differently: 2-4 people singing, 1 really flexible lady, some ballet and choreo.
* The ship is gorgeous.
* The cruise director and the assistant cruise director were wonderful.
* Our cabin had a bathtub, I considered that a win until we actually showered. There is no curtain, only a small glass divider that doesn't move, unless you are very careful when showering, all the floor (and possibly the toilet too) will get wet/soaked.
* Another thing I remember seeing on reddit was people complaining about the smart elevators. Personally, it didn't bother me much, it just needs some tweaking because the time estimates over 30-second waits are wayyyyy off.

The Okay (i.e. other stuff):

* Ocean Cay was wonderful, it is a beautiful place and we can't wait to go back. The food is the same as the onboard lunch buffet but more limited.
* Kayak, paddleboard, snorkeling, and jet ski rentals at Ocean Cay sell out too fast though, not because of demand, but rather supply.
* The itinerary was really good (Ocean Cay, Nassau, San Juan, Puerto Plata), the only thing I would have changed was to skip Nassau and add a stop in the Virgin Islands or Sint Maarten.
* My only gripe with the itinerary was how much time we got in the ports. We got about 6 hours in Ocean Cay but 2 hours were lost on an impromptu storm. We left Ocean Cay at 4:30pm despite the next port being super close? We arrived to Nassau at 7am and left at 1:30pm? We arrived to San Juan at 10am??? and left at 4:30pm??? 10am to 5:30pm in Puerto Plata was perfect though.

Is it the same as other cruises where when you  get off the ship at each of the ports in the Canary Islands, tour operators will be standing by to take you on the various tours that you may have not booked on Viator or with the cruise previously?

There are a few things I'd like to do,  but I'm having a hard time finding exactly what I want.  I have cruised many other parts of the world and just about every port has a lineup of taxis and tour companies waiting to take you on whatever trip you want.

After 12 weeks, we reached out to Park West and was told it was ‚Äúin framing.‚Äù At the four month mark we had not heard anything back and the birthday had passed so we asked for a refund. The customer service agent told us that no refunds were possible. Park West was unable to explain why the artwork had not shipped and could not give a timeline for shipping. I asked for the issue to be escalated to someone else because I wanted to work things out amicably before resorting to a credit card dispute. The customer service agent refused. 

We filed a credit card dispute since at point over four months had passed and we had not receieved the artwork. 

It‚Äôs now been six months. Our dispute was found in our favor and we received our money back. But I‚Äôm still blown away ‚Äî six months and they never sent the artwork. 

I know under the FTC I didn‚Äôt need to do this, but they are such a mess that I did email them tonight to reiterate that they should not ship the artwork at this point because the dispute was found in our favor.

Cruise,"Our first ever cruise was on Celebrity in Alaska in 2016. Second was last year via Disney to Bahamas and Cozumel. I didn‚Äôt think I would like cruises, but both experiences exceeded expectations. 

For our third, we tried the Norwegian Joy close to the recent Christmas holidays. We were disappointed with long, long wait times for boarding and disembarking, especially when initially boarding (almost 3 hours!) and tendering to and from Cabo San Lucas. Nothing seemed to be going according to schedule throughout the trip. (There were some technical problems with the anchor which threw us off schedule, but we didn‚Äôt hold that against them.) We were confused by needing a ticket/reservation for everything, which wasn‚Äôt very clear to us as new NCL travelers that had only booked two weeks prior, and we missed our chance to do some of the things we hoped to do on board. 

One gripe - booked a 3 hour excursion to snorkel in Cabo. We spent an hour waiting to be loaded onto the tender, but only got to spend about 20 minutes of our 3 hours in the water, and closer to 2-2.5 hours with the group leading the tour. When I complained about this later, guest services said the time spent on the tender boat headed to the port counted as part of the excursion time, which we found goofy. At Cabo, we got in line to return to the Joy by tender an hour before our deadline, and the line stretched what seemed like a third of a mile back and barely moved. We waited an hour and a half for a tender, and everyone around us was pissed and confused. And hungry. Princess Cruises had an identical trip that clearly had a process that was working wherever we went, and they boarded their last tender according to schedule in a reasonable line that moved quickly at Cabo. 

I figured that might be our last time trying NCL, but I did overhear a few guests mention that it wasn‚Äôt normal for things to be so off. Not sure I would book again, but I thought I would get this sub‚Äôs take before completely counting them out in the future. 

I did like NCL‚Äôs food! I also liked our balcony. We moved our futon cushions to the balcony for a private sunbathing spot, which was great because it was pretty crowded elsewhere. Cushions fit perfectly and basking in the sun is my favorite memory from the trip.",First time trying NCL - maybe our last,,rocksinafield,,0,2023-01-14 21:27:31

And when I look at the ports and excursions (I'm looking at the Caribbean) no ports really jump out at me (except for maybe ruins in Mexico). I don't scuba or anything and shopping isn't really an interest of mine. I've never been to the Caribbean, though, so maybe just general sightseeing would be good.  (I would like to be on a beach for a day, though, to walk on the sand.)  

If all of this is the case, wouldn't an all-inclusive resort be a better option? I'm not interested in slides or bumper cars or anything, but  I'm not really worried about being bored if I don't get off the ship. What I'm now wondering is, if all I want is to essentially stay in one place -  on a ship - how is that different from an all-inclusive resort? (Is an all-inclusive better/cheaper?)

Questions that I've had...how many hours can I reasonably expect to spend in each port if say 9am is arrival and 5pm is sail?  Is it okay to keep the reservations I made for tours through Viator, or is it better to use the NCL-recommended tours? How much of a factor is cabin size really?

Cruise,"Hello,

Our family of 4 (our kids are 13m but celebrating his birthday and 9f) is struggling to choose our next cruise.  Last June, we took the Norwegian Joy to Bermuda and absolutely loved it.  We loved the restaurants, the activities.  The ship was spotless and we were never bored or hungry.  Bermuda was beautiful, easy to navigate and safe.  

We were looking at the Carnival Venezia for this June.  It will be brand new (I believe we are looking at their second US Sailing).  My husband and I cruised Carnival 15 years ago for our honeymoon but don't remember a lot from the experience.  We did enjoy it, however.  My concern is we are struggling to get a lower room and I do get sea sick.  (If anyone has any insight on the movement of the 9th floor of a Vista class ship, I'd love to know).

The Carnival Cruise is significantly cheaper and the boat will be nearly brand new coming out of refurbishment.  Even the restaurants and menus aren't fully announced so it may be a neat experience to try something new.  They're also doing Amber Cove, Grand Turk, and Half Moon Cay.  We haven;t been to any of these places.

Cruise,"So I just spent the afternoon on hold with Princess and I am beyond frustrated. We have sailed with them before and had a very nice time. We booked another cruise, but somehow in the booking process, Princess signed up my husband but not me, even though fares for both were paid. It took a phone call to resolve the issue and get us both on the reservation. Finally, everything is resolved except our reservation for the dining room. Somehow making a reservation where we eat together is causing a technical glitch that has been escalated to tech support and we are instructed to call again in five days to see whether the problem has been fixed. 

This whole process has taken hours of my day and I was placed on hold once and the call was dropped, so I had to call again and wait again to speak to a human. I am disappointed. I was very happy with the actual cruise experience last time, but it doesn't seem too much to ask to have a booking process that just works, or can be easily corrected if it fails. Making a reservation for a couple sailing together in the dining room is part of their core business and seems like it should be a no brainer.

Cruise,"So last month I decided to buy my parents a cruise trip for Christmas. I had purchased everything on carnival‚Äôs website and even prepaid gratuities to get it over with, or so I thought. Flash forward to today I had received an email specifying that prices for gratuity will increase after April. The email even had a link to pre pay for gratuities to ‚Äúsave‚Äù money. Well I was curious and selected the link and very well upon inspecting my booking it did not mention anywhere that I had prepaid anything and if I would like to add it. I went ahead and called carnival and they said they did not see anything on their end. I am 100% sure I had added this to my payment before completing the purchase. In addition to this, the agent somewhat confirmed the math. I wasn‚Äôt sure the exact amount of the gratuities were, but she stated it was roughly $87. When I had initially looked into booking this the total price was about $589 without gratuities. In the end I had selected to add them to cart which then raised it to about $676. The agent mentioned that I had never added that anywhere and that my booking price without tips were $676. I cannot emphasize enough that I am sure I added this on.

Its a couple years later, and while VV is still high on our radar, our next vacation is going to be with our 6 year old. 

Last year we did 2 weeks at DW and my daughter absolutely loved the Magic of it all.  My husband and I are ehhhh on the Disney factor, but at the same time he's a huge Marvel/Starwars fan and anything in that genre makes him giddy.

I am someone who enjoys ""luxury"", a really good spa day, upgraded restaurants, but am working with a reasonably modest budget here.  I work in the service industry, so when I travel, I do enjoy being pampered and spending money on things that I find value in.  Ie, I'll book a suite not necessarily for the space, but extra perks like not waiting in lines, access to room service, etc.  

Now, to add another wrench to all of this - we live in The Bahamas, so Bahamian itineraries don't interest me at all, so if we were to pick a Disney Bahamas itinerary it would be entirely based on the ship being the destination and focus of our vacation enjoyment.

Is a 4 night Disney cruise, in a Ocean View room, really worth 2-3x the cost of a 7-9 night trip in a Balcony or even entry level Suite on one of the RCCL ships?

Cruise,"Hey cruising community, I'm usually not one to make a sub post regarding personal needs, but I really don't know where else to turn.  

Short backstory: 

My gf and I just booked a 4 night bahama's cruise aboard the MSC Meraviglia through [cruisedirect.com](https://cruisedirect.com) ;   we got a balcony suite that claimed ""Free Drinks &amp; Wifi Package"" , I had even taken a picture of the icon under the bonus category before clicking confirm.   Upon purchasing, I received an email of confirmation that show's my bill, as well as my itinerary with the packages it includes.  On the final bill it clearly says in this email ""New Years Sale - Free Drinks &amp; Wifi + Kids Sail Free""  is included in my purchase. 

I called cruisedirect yesterday to go over my trip details, and was shocked to hear that neither my girlfriend or I have the free drinks and wifi package.   I provided her with my receipt email which she was able to clearly see on her computer, and she said she would ""call msc"".  She called me back to tell me that there is nothing her or MSC can do, and claimed that at the bottom of the promo it says ""ask about the New Years Sale before Booking"" which really means nothing to me, especially considering that there were no promo code fields or anything of that matter to *physically input the promo*.  Also, it clearly says in my email that it's included!!! 

The final conclusion she came to, is that she would need to cancel my existing booking, which will take 30 to 90 business days to get my money back, and the initial total of $800 American will change to $1000 American grand total.   I told her that I am not accepting that, and only because I clearly have on my receipt the free drinks and wifi promo package that was included.  It feels like false advertising to me, and I am more upset that I am not being entitled to something that was clearly on my final receipt.   

I am now waiting for a phone call from the supervisor in which *Queen* the associate I was speaking to said she would have him call me.   It's been almost an hour, so I decided to call the number myself and speak to a manager directly, only to be greeted by *Queen* on the phone again.  So now I am worried as to if this website is even legit to begin with.  I find it very sketchy that 2 times in a row I was connected to *Queen*.  In which last night she was assisting me outside of her office is what it sounded like on the phone.  

With our flights and hotel already booked, I can't just accept a cancellation for an answer which was where my frustration by the end of the call was stemming from.  I also do not want to sit 1-3 months waiting for $1100 CAD to come back to my credit card.   I am not sure what my next steps of action are to take if the manager comes back with the same answer.  Do I call MSC? Do I take cruisedirect to court regarding this matter?  To me it feels like being no better than going to your local best buy and buying something only to open up the box to something completely different when your receipt clearly says otherwise.  It just feels like such a scam to me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with cruisedirect before? and if so how reputable of a company are they?

Wi-Fi coverage throughout the ship was very inconsistent.  There were four cabins in my party on Decks 10 and 6.  Some reported good Wi-Fi coverage, where I was (10162, forward by elevators) coverage was almost non-existent.  

The Wi-Fi struggled and even dropped connections when crowds were present.  Most notable: the promenade on deck 5, Amber Theater, and Aqua Theater.  The pool deck, the solarium, Central Park and surprisingly the Windjammer had the most reliable coverage.  Something to take into consideration if you need to make a work phone call.

Cruise,"How rare is it to get stranded in Mexico without a passport?

We are booked for a  4 day cruise from Miami to Cozumel Mexico and have never been before. It's a closed loop cruise so we were told we could just use our birth certificate and driver's license. But I've seen some posts that make me concerned that we could potentially be left stranded when we come back on board from a shore excursion because we are traveling without passports. How often does that happen? We were considering a ship sponsored shore excursion. Is it even worth risking getting off the boat in Mexico? 

P.S. it was a last minute book and there isn't time to apply for a passport",How rare is it to get stranded in Mexico without a passport (cruise),,evinalae,,0,2023-01-11 13:02:30

Cruise,"Hi all! Taking my first cruise in April on the Majestic Princess from Sydney to Aukland.

It is 5 days and the first 2.5 days are ‚Äúat sea‚Äù.

The reservation says there is 1 formal night and I have a few questions.

What night is formal night?

Is the food different than if I were to sit down at one of the included (free) dining room restaurants and ordered off the menu there?

Other than how people are dressed, how is Formal Night different than any other night in terms of dinner experience?

I am going with my parents but I feel like formal clothes are cumbersome to pack. Would they turn a man away if he wore a dress shirt with no jacket?   


Side question about food: can I go to Alfredo‚Äôs and the buffet for the same meal? Just in case my parents don‚Äôt like the food at Alfredo‚Äôs (they don‚Äôt like cheese but I love pizza), I want to make sure they get enough to eat and the buffet seems easy. 

Is food at the main dining rooms (the ones that are included but have a menu) better than the food at the buffet? 

Also, does anywhere on the ship serve macarons?

What is the most comfortable (soft cushioning) place for me to lie down all day, outside of my cabin?   
In some videos, I noticed these indoor seats with spherical looking covers, sort of like a coconut where a quarter of it was carved out. I think that might be nice and private.

Cruise,"Hello everyone. As I type this I‚Äôm sitting on the wonderful balcony hammock on Valiant Lady of Virgin Voyages, listening to the sounds of the waves, alcoholic drink in my hand, you would think I would be happy right? WRONG. Let me take you back in time to when this first started. 

Saga 1: in September 2022 I booked a virgin cruise near Christmas for December 2022. I then looked up flights and noticed they were a lot more expensive around Christmas (should have thought of that earlier but I was excited for the cruise okay). So I called virgin to rebook, as you can change your cruise up to 45 days before your sailing or cancel for a full refund from 7 days after you book (this is important later). So I can to reschedule our booking for January 2023, and it was super easy. HA WRONG. I end up calling multiple times, waiting for hours, using the call back button but never getting a call back, using their online chat service but it would just kick me off without ever speaking to someone. FINALLY I get ahold of someone, and I‚Äôm so frustrated I just want to cancel my cruise. Well it took so long for someone to call me back that it had already passed the 7 days for a refund, in fact I was on day 8, just short one day. I asked to speak to a supervisor (I know, Karen move, please don‚Äôt hate me) to ask since it took so long to get ahold of can I have a refund as it was not my fault. They said, sure benevolentbluecat, we value our customers, sorry for all the trouble you‚Äôve had, and here‚Äôs your money back. HAAAAA WRROOONNNGGGG. They said they didn‚Äôt have records of me calling, even though I had the phone calls in my phone probably at least 7 times or more, and that the chat on their website was my internets fault, even though I tried on my home network and my work one. So the supervisor ended up canceling my reservation as we were speaking, even though I never said to cancel because I did not want to lose my money. I decided to keep it because at least my husband and I would still get to go on a cruise. She then rebooked our cruise over the phone for the one in January. And that was the happy ending. 

WRONG. 

Saga 2: I call back 12/24/2022 to add the ‚Äúsplash of romance package‚Äù to our booking, and because there was a promo when we booked in September that they would add an extra 100 dollars to your booking at the time, but of course because it‚Äôs fucking virgin, I didn‚Äôt see it on the booking. I called, and someone answers the phone right away (SHOCKING) and I ask about the promo to make sure we got it. He says ‚Äúnope don‚Äôt see 100 dollars anywhere, fuck you‚Äù (didn‚Äôt actually say that but that‚Äôs how it sounded in my head but might as well) and said there is nothing that they can do. He does say we can add a free bottle of wine on board (again important) in place of the extra 100 dollars. My husband was with me when I spoke with him so I know I wasn‚Äôt going crazy, and I looked at him, and he said that was fine and to calm down Karen and that the bottle of wine was good enough (it‚Äôs why I married him, he‚Äôs the better part of me). So I say okay bottle of wine will do. And then we got our bottle of wine and had a great cruise. 

WRONG. 

Saga 3: We get on the boat. No bottle of wine. We go to sailor services, asking about it. The lady looks at me like I‚Äôm a Karen explaining my story. Y‚Äôall I promise I‚Äôm really not! If it wasn‚Äôt for my husband I probably would be, but anyway. So she says they will message the Miami office about the bottle of wine because the don‚Äôt see it on our booking. Miami responds, nope we don‚Äôt see anything. We‚Äôre on the cruise, and want to enjoy our vacation, so I almost dropped it. But then she says ‚ÄúMiami said that you contacted NUMEROUS times about this issue and this is your first cruise, so please stop requesting this‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm. Sorry. WHAT. 

Numerous times?? I contacted them once about the extra 100 dollar promo on 12/24, and once literally that day. They were making me out to be a crazy insane person contacting them multiple time about this same issue. So my husband and I send messages to sailor services and say that we would like the Miami office to listen to the recording from 12/24, and I know he promised us a free bottle of wine. They get back with us and apologize, that yes he did and here‚Äôs a free bottle of wine. You know where this is going‚Ä¶.

WRONG.
They said they listened to the tape and nothing was promised. Folks, this is where I need your help. What should my next move be? I know what was said, and thank god my husband was with me so we had 2 people that heard it. I don‚Äôt want to be called a liar. My husband thinks we should just leave it alone, but the Karen rage is building up inside of me and I don‚Äôt know if I can hold it back. They did give us a 100 dollar bottle of brut from sailor services that said ‚ÄúI hope this makes your stay a little better‚Äù but no apology or admitting what was really said. Can I request the recording? Can I ask them to listen to it again? Help!

Cruise,"My wife and I took a HAL Kongingsdam on an Alaskan Cruise from 17-24 September from Vancouver. On the cruise we decided to have some formal pictures done a man Connel, who inferred he worked for Joe Craig Black Label photography. 

We sat for the pictures and place an order which came to $1200 USD. We were given a receipt and  told that the pictures would be shipped to us within 10 weeks of the end of the cruise.

The ten weeks passed and no pictures. I contacted the only contact info on the package we had it was to [photography@HAGroup.com](mailto:photography@HAGroup.com) and never received a response.

I then contacted my credit card company and Holland America Customer service as I believed I was scammed. Both organizations opened up a case file.

I scoured the internet looking for the Joe Craig Black Label photography in hopes we could sort it out. I found the company in Australia and emailed them and asked about our photos. This is the response I received:

I just wanted to know if I actually can have fun on a cruise other than hanging around my family who certainly would want some alone time too. I mean, is it easy meeting new people, flirting with girls at the same age, partying and stuff like that, or is everyone on a trip like that usually travelling with their spouse?

Room service - is it true you can get room service included in this package - just pay gratuity?

How does it really work with toddler in bedroom and  one parent coming back late at night? Should I bring a curtain with me to pull across the room?  (seen it somewhere before).

Cruise," Hi everyone! I hope this is allowed ‚Äì I just got off a 7 night Caribbean cruise on the Norwegian Bliss, and I thought I would give you all a trip report!

This was mine (39F) and my husband‚Äôs (46M) second-ever cruise together. We were on a 7-night Canada and New England cruise in October on the NCL Breakaway, which we both really enjoyed. About us: we live in Pennsylvania, we like to eat, scuba dive, and hike. I like to drink, but my husband rarely has more than one at a time.

For this cruise, we‚Äôd booked a balcony room and gotten NCL‚Äôs Free at Sea offers, so we had 2 specialty dining meals apiece, plus the unlimited drinks package. We did bid on a few room upgrades and found out shortly before the cruise that we had gotten an upgrade to a Spa balcony cabin ‚Äì we wound up in room 15866. We liked the stateroom ‚Äì it felt decently spacious and had good storage. Because of the location of our room, the balcony was angled and slightly larger than the one we had on the Breakaway. On the Breakaway, we had a Spa mini-suite, and the main difference between the two rooms was that the mini-suite bathroom was larger, with double sinks and a bigger shower. We liked the location of our room on the Bliss ‚Äì it was right by the aft staircase, so we could easily run up one deck and be at the spa. We wound up paying $600 extra for the upgrade, which we considered worthwhile for access to the thermal suite.

We got on the ship in Miami slightly before noon on 12/31. Our cabin wasn‚Äôt ready yet, so we headed to the buffet and got to know the lay of the land on the ship. That wasn‚Äôt too tough, as the Bliss is a Breakaway-plus class vessel and thus was pretty similar to the Breakaway in its layout. We decided to stop in to book a spa appointment. They were offering an extra free 25 minutes on certain services on the departure day, so we got a couple‚Äôs massage appointment for 5 PM that day ‚Äì 75 minutes for the price of 50. By the time we had it booked, our cabin was ready (although our luggage had yet to be delivered). We had intentionally packed our bathing suits in our carry-on luggage, so we put those on and headed up to the thermal suite to relax before our massage.

We quite liked the thermal suite. Again, it was similar to the Breakaway‚Äôs, but a little bit larger. It also had a snow room (basically a big freezer) that I enjoyed using for a few minutes after turns in the sauna. We spent a lot of time on this cruise basking like lizards on the heated ceramic loungers! The thermal suite has a pool, hot tub, sauna, aromatherapy steam room, salt room, snow room, ceramic loungers, and regular cushioned loungers. It‚Äôs in the aft of deck 16, with the loungers arranged facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The massage we had was great, if verrrry pricey -- $499, plus an automatic 20% gratuity.

After the massage, we had a reservation at Le Bistro (our first specialty dining of two). I thought the beef tartare appetizer and the ile flottante dessert I had were both exceptional, but my scallop and shrimp entr√©e was only okay. My husband enjoyed his meal ‚Äì scallop starter, French onion soup, sea bass, and a chocolate dessert. The restaurant itself was romantic inside. We were seated at a window, but since it was after dark‚Ä¶. shrug.

We spent the rest of the evening wandering around the ship, grabbing drinks at various bars. We spent some time watching college football with a big group of Georgia fans, but we weren‚Äôt particularly invested in the game and so dipped in and out. I thought it was very cool that the ship had so many distinct bars with their own feel and menus. It definitely allowed us to feel like we were genuinely in different venues around the boat.

We went down to the ship‚Äôs atrium shortly before midnight, where there was a big crowd and live music. We counted down to midnight, waited for the balloons to drop from above, and were back in our stateroom by about 12:10 AM. (We‚Äôre old.) I thought this was a great way to do NYE ‚Äì we got to drink, ‚Äúgo out,‚Äù and celebrate‚Ä¶. without having to worry about driving or being on the roads. 10/10, highly recommend cruising on NYE.

Luckily the next day was a sea day, so we could sleep in. Before the cruise, we had bought passes to NCL‚Äôs Vibe Beach Club. This is a fee-only adult sun deck, and given that I‚Äôd heard that the NCL sun decks can be chaotic, I figured this was a good use of 250 bucks (‚Ä¶each). The area itself was nice and serene, with lots of padded loungers, a bar, and a hot tub. The staff were great, bringing drinks, fruit, and cold washcloths. We spent most of January 1 bouncing between Vibe and the thermal suite. We got dinner at Food Republic, a for-fee dining location that serves world cuisine. I had a sushi roll I loved and my husband really liked the street corn. We saw Jersey Boys after dinner ‚Äì I had no expectations going in but thought it was excellent. The talent on the ship overall was phenomenal.

The next day, January 2, we were in Roatan, Honduras. We‚Äôd booked a scuba excursion through NCL as the very first thing we did after booking the cruise ‚Äì diving in Roatan was a major reason we selected this itinerary. The diving was absolutely gorgeous and the excursion was mostly well-run. We had a shorter surface interval between the two tanks than I would have liked, and we were not directed back to our transportation at the end of excursion, which led to some confusion. Overall, though, I loved the diving and would absolutely do it again.

As we were getting back on the ship, I got a massive migraine, killing the rest of our day. Despite our plans to enjoy more thermal suite time after the dive and to see a comedy show that night, we spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in our blacked-out cabin.

January 3 was our day in Harvest Caye, which is Norwegian‚Äôs private island in Belize. We had breakfast at one of the ship‚Äôs small free sit-down venues (Taste and Savor). We‚Äôd tried breakfast at the buffet the day before and found the complete and utter chaos off-putting. The sit-down breakfast was much more relaxing. We got off the ship early (pre 8 AM) and spent about an hour strolling around the island. The beach and pool both seemed very nice, but despite it being a private island, the food and drinks are not included in the cruise fare, so we didn‚Äôt stay long. The highlight of the island for me was the little wildlife sanctuary NCL has. It seems so incongruous on a cruise line island, and they had scarlet macaws, toucans, and a little butterfly house. It‚Äôs a small area, but it‚Äôs cool free thing to do.

Back on the ship, we again spent the day alternating between lounging in the sun at Vibe, lounging on heated loungers in the spa, and lounging on chaises in the observation lounge. The observation lounge at the front of deck 15 is an amazing space. There was a small buffet of things like sandwiches and pastries out in the afternoons, a bar, and lots of seating. It was a great place to relax and just watch the ocean. One of my favorite spots on the ship. We had dinner at the ship‚Äôs buffet ‚Äì the quality of which I thought was surprisingly good. In particular, it had several Indian dishes (changing every night, and going well beyond the usual palak paneer and butter chicken) that made up the bulk of our dinners when we ate at the buffet. After dinner, we went to the theater to see the Beatles cover band. Neither of us are particular Beatles fans, but the show was a tight 45 minutes and they were incredibly talented. I was sad we never made it to a second show of theirs (they do three different shows a couple of times each). We again toured the various bars and spent a good bit of time walking along what NCL calls The Waterfront, a promenade on deck 8. It has the outdoor spaces for several of the bars and restaurants on deck 8 and is a great place to stroll after dinner. There‚Äôs lots of seating, and it never felt crowded. Another of my favorite spaces on the ship.

January 4 was a schedule change. The ship was supposed to sail north from Belize up the Yucatan coast to Costa Maya then to Cozumel, but for some reason that wasn‚Äôt explained, we sailed north to Cozumel first, then back south to Costa Maya. So January 4 wound up being in Cozumel instead of Costa Maya. I believe this change required us to leave Belize early (all aboard in Harvest Caye the day before was 2:30 PM) and we didn‚Äôt get off the ship in Cozumel until after 11 AM. We had booked an excursion with NCL to the Mayan ruins at Tulum, including a swim in a cenote.

Overall, we were glad we booked the excursion and felt like it was very well-organized. That said, getting from Cozumel to Tulum required a 45 minute ferry ride and an hour on a bus (this was made clear when we booked the excursion, to be fair ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt surprise us with it). And because our arrival in Cozumel was fairly late, we spent very little time actually, you know, excursioning. I would love to go back and spend half a day at the ruins in Tulum and another half a day in a cenote. The ruins were stunning.

We wound up being very glad we were on an official excursion, as a traffic jam got us back to the boat a solid hour after the stated all-aboard time. They waited for all of us, though! We were so exhausted and hungry at this point that we went directly to the buffet carrying our wet swimsuits and absolutely inhaled two huge plates of Indian food and a couple of the made-to-order crepes.

For our day in Costa Maya, we decided on the ship to book a beach club excursion. I‚Äôm not sad we did it, but I‚Äôd never do it again. The beach was nice enough, and the Caribbean sea was gorgeous, but the beach was packed with people. We were back on the ship in the afternoon and once again hung out at a combination of the observation lounge, Vibe, and the thermal suite until it was time to go see SIX. We‚Äôd already seen it on the Breakaway, but I thought it was so much fun I wanted to see it again. It was fantastic again. After the show, we went back to Food Republic so I could get that sushi roll again. Afterward, we stopped in at the District Brew House, the beer bar. There was a live piano player taking requests and encouraging singing along. Anthony was crazy talented and entertaining, and we wound up staying until midnight. It was an absolute blast and lowkey one of my favorite things we did.

The last day! It was a sea day, and you guessed it‚Ä¶ we hung out at Vibe, the observation lounge, and the thermal suite. It was seriously windy, so we didn‚Äôt wind up spending much time at Vibe, but it was an overall very lovely and relaxing way to end the cruise. We had our second free specialty meal at Q, the Bliss‚Äôs barbecue restaurant. It was much better than I expected it would be, and the quantity of food they served us was truly staggering. I had fried okra, brisket, and banana pudding, and I‚Äôd eat them all again in a heartbeat. The restaurant doubles as a live music venue, so we listened to a British band play American country music while we ate. We decided to spend our final night back at the District listening to Anthony play the piano again, and it was a perfect way to end the trip.

Overall, we had an amazing time. The food was mostly very good, the entertainment was fantastic, and the ship had a ton to do. I was glad we spent the money to access some less crowded parts of the ship ‚Äì the pool deck is not big enough, honestly, and was a total zoo on the sea days.

I am looking for suggestions for a first time traveler. I've never traveled outside of the US before and I was thinking about an Mediterranean cruise but it seems a bit overwhelming for me right now.

I am 29. No children.

I will also be traveling with someone who is on peritoneal dialysis so anything longer than 7-10 days wouldn't be ideal.

Ship size doesn't matter. 

I am not a partier or drinker, so a calmer environment would be nice BUT NOT a deal breaker. 

I am looking to be more off the ship than on hopefully.

Warmer the climate the better.

Food is not a deal breaker either, I'll eat almost anything.

Cruise,"My employer shuts down between Christmas and New Year's Day. I took advantage of that last month by taking a Christmas cruise out of Ft Lauderdale.  It's a tricky time to fly because (1) it's the holidays and (2) I'm on the west coast and might need a connection. I did luck out this time because I was able to change my flight from the 22nd (day before) to the 20th for no fee (and still getting a window seat, yay), thus missing the nasty weather that closed the airport shortly thereafter.

For Christmas 2023, I'm heading to Port Canaveral. Cruise date is the 23rd, which means flying in the day before = flying on the Friday before Christmas. Er, that sounds like a bad idea.

**Option 1:** Fly in a couple days early and chill out, which is what I did for Christmas 2022. Gotta pick a better hotel this time, maybe one that actually has USB ports or at least more functioning electrical outlets. 

**Option 2:** Book a short cruise which returns to PC on the 23rd, meaning I'll be flying in well before the holiday (but using more vacation time).

**Option 3:** Book a short cruise returning to Miami or Ft Lauderdale on the 22nd and then head up to PC for the night before boarding.

**Option 4:** Book on a non-stop on the 22nd and buy really good travel insurance.

Considering what I spent for 3 nights at the hotel plus meals, it would cost about the same or even a touch less to grab an inside cabin for a 3 or 4 night cruise. Plus, I'd be on a ship \*and\* would likely get to spend a day at one of the cruise line private islands. Option 3 has more possible cruise options but I'd need to either do a one-way car rental or hope the Brightline extension to Orlando is open by then, plus I'd need to either get back to MIA/FLL or book an open jaw flight for hopefully not too much more money.

Well, people tell you to just fly in the day before anyways. Which I do. Tell me why in suburban Florida you either have to (based on the Google review consensus) fear for your life and stay in a shack or pay $400 for one night in a hotel. Or pay $200 for one night and stay 35 minutes from the port by Uber. Every weekend it‚Äôs like this.

I'm Zlatko from Macedonia, a former cruise ship employee. Working on ships for five years was a wonderful experience, but in March 2020, the thing happened, and I was sent home with the rest of the crew. After a year and a half, in October 2021, I got an offer from the company to return to the ship, but trying to renew my medical documents, I was diagnosed with heart failure due to the virus. The condition is not naive, and unfortunately, I will never be able to pass a medical check-up and work on a cruise ship again. Because of that, I started working a seasonal job in Alaska at fish processing plants, where I didn't need to present medical documentation. Still, the job there is extreme, and my health condition is getting worse, so I decided to publish the diary I wrote on my first contract on ships.

Cruise,"We had a strange issue on a Princess cruise; it was our first cruise ever. I‚Äôm looking to see what, if anything, we should do next.

We had a wonderful cruise - we loved it. At one point towards the end, they asked for volunteers to give blood in a medical emergency. They whittled down the volunteers and my wife was selected to have labs done to verify her suitability to donate blood. Ultimately, she ended up giving blood to help another passenger. This experience was pretty unique and exciting.

Experienced cruisers with us predicted we‚Äôd get future cruise credit as thanks. We didn‚Äôt, which is fine and we didn‚Äôt expect.

However, when we checked our stateroom account, we had been billed several hundred dollars for donating blood. We explained to guest services and we were very casual about it - an obvious error. Guest services refused to to reverse it multiple times and told us we were simply confused and we must‚Äôve forgotten that we sought medical care. We insisted and explained, asked to talk to a manager, no luck. It got pretty argumentative. Particularly because we saw other passengers next to us getting drink chargers removed effortlessly and having their gratuity charges removed. Guest services said we couldn‚Äôt ask the medical center because they were closed and would be the remainder of the cruise (this was the last evening).

She told us there was nothing she could do and we‚Äôd just have to pay it, and to leave. We refused.

Finally, she said if we could prove we didn‚Äôt receive medical care she would reverse it. I said ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre charging me, you prove we received it‚Äù and she finally removed it.

I thought it‚Äôd be a funny little moment and a simple reversal; instead it was 30 minutes of arguing.

I explained this in my survey but haven‚Äôt heard back. I don‚Äôt fault the medical team for a simple human error, but I fault guest services for handling it so poorly.

Cruise,"My wife is taking a girl's trip in February and I had the thought to fly down with her to Miami and hop a weekend cruise (likely Carnival) and fly back with her on Monday. I've read a lot of posts about going on solo cruises, but I'm wondering how much I would enjoy it has a somewhat introverted person.

Essentially, I'm not the kind of person that's going to want to sit at a table with a bunch of strangers, I'm not going to hang around the bar and meet people, I'm not going to introduce myself to folks for trivia, that's just not my style. When I try to picture what my experience on the cruise would be like, it would basically be three straight days with my AirPods in if I'm not at the comedy club or a show. So I'd basically be paying for a lot of food and a handful of shows, solo trivia, maybe some time laying on the deck, maybe a massage, but that would be about it.

I'm not the kind of person to get off the boat, the cruise I took last time we did a couple of shore excursions to private beaches and I was miserable most of the time. People are loud, lots of people were smoking, I just put on noise canceling headphones and read on my Kindle.

Cruise,"An extremely honest review:

Onboarding/Off-boarding was pretty good. It was easy to get on and off the ship. Things do move a little quick so be sure to have your passport and IDs ready. We had to walk four floors of ramps and that can be a bit exhausting if you have a heavy bag with you. 

For Food/Drinks, I would recommend bringing your own snacks and sodas/juices (check cruise guidelines to be safe). When it came to dining in the main dining halls ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt too impressed. It was basic food and nothing to write home about. Though the servers were amazing, the food wasn‚Äôt and came in small portions. Everything needed some extra seasoning. But if you‚Äôre not used to three-course dining experiences, at least try it once. Just be prepared. In regards, to the windjammer‚Ä¶ I thought it was a little better than main dining because they had variety of food that you could pick from the bar. Breakfast was standard and same every morning. Each night had a different theme‚Äîfrom Indian to Jamaican. Some of the food was cold and we wish there was a variety of free drinks. They had a very sugar-loaded orange juice that I couldn‚Äôt finish. Also, it‚Äôs recommended to bring gloves because all of the non-washed hands touching the serving utensils was disgusting. Cocktails were extremely weak and watered down! Not worth the price you pay at the bars (with the high gratuity).

Specialty Dining ‚Äî Chef‚Äôs Table was EXQUISITE‚Ä¶all the food and wine had us feeling amazing. Everything was delicious and they took really good care of us ‚Äî pampering us like royalty. It‚Äôs highly recommended‚ÄîI would do this at least once per trip. Food spans from lobster salad to amazing soups to mind-blowing cocktails. The sliced scallops from Chef Eduardo and team was amazing and the filet mignon was perfect. It was also very fun to try different wine pairings with the different plates. And for Chops Grille, the customer service was excellent. The best thing on their menu was the truffle oil-infused mushroom soup and the warm chocolate cake. I would not recommend the red velvet ‚Äî did not taste like grandma‚Äôs‚Ä¶ tasted generic. Wine (Sauvignon Blanc) was good!

In terms of Customer Service, Agus (our cleaner) was amazing, polite, and always left fun towel animals on our bed. He catered to our every need, even providing pillows. Guest services and the attendants around the ship were great!!! But there were a few bad apples in the bunch to include a rude cyclist instructor who also sat in at the front desk at the spa. There was also rude workers at the cafe and ice cream stand who were very short with us. The cupcake decoration facilitator was really nice and warm.

Activities were not catered to people of color‚Ä¶ really focused on older white people and kids. I wish they had a designated lounge or club area that played solely hip-hop, r&amp;b, and soca. We enjoyed the cupcake decorating but could not do rock climbing because someone booked the entire thing. We wished they had more modern movies playing with diverse characters and themes. The flash mob and Zumba was really cheesy though some seemed to be really enjoying themselves. 

Quality of Ship - VERY OLD ship‚Ä¶ probably the oldest in their fleet and about to be sold off. Elevators were slow. Windows were obviously rusted with many maintenance marks, etc.

Cococay, Bahamas ‚Äî you could tell it was not an authentic Bahamanian island. It had NO authentic island food (e.g. conch fritters), the music was mediocre‚Ä¶ except for the pool party at the Oasis Lagoon. The exclusive beach club is worth it if you want to get away from the noise and all of the kids running around. The food was bad‚Ä¶not a surprise since it came straight off the ship. 

Overall, my experience was a 4 out of 5. I think if they remodeled the ship, upgraded the rooms and food/drink ‚Äî then this could definitely be a 5-star ship. Seeing the amazing stars and moon with my beloved was unforgettable. Captain was amazing and was hauling!

Ps. Stay safe ‚Äî only a few people wore masks and we even saw food servers sneezing into their hands and then proceeded to handle the food.

Cruise,"The FTC has started a 3 day period where they are attempting to collect complaints regarding hidden/deceptive fees. I have filed a complaint regarding the hidden fees charged by the cruise lines. The port, fees, taxes, and gratuities add a large amount to the cost of the cruise. Based on a sampling, the true prices were 19% to 106% higher than the advertised pricing.   


I'm not saying the hard-working crew doesn't serve these gratuities, they certainly do, but these fees should either be included in the cruise fare or disclosed more clearly when booking. While seasoned cruisers know and understand these, a first time cruiser will be shocked to see a $406 charge on the last day of the cruise. The only reason they're separate fees is so they can advertise deceptively low rates. 

The same goes for port fees. They're not included in the upfront rate, but account for a huge portion of the cost. Especially now that many cruise lines own the ports and get to set the port fees, they should be forced to include them in the upfront pricing. 

If you feel the same, you can leave your comments on the FTC page.

Cruise,"I booked a cruise on a certain cruiseline, a pretty new ship as well.

But reading the reviews, I started noting something strange. The 'Terrible' ratings (the first ones I want to read, because it might be an indicator I'd rather not have booked) had me wonder.

Here are some samples of complaints (written by couples in their 60s and 70s):

The TV had less channels than previous cruises.  The new televisions had only BBC MSNBC and Fox for news.  No CNN or PBS.  
Fitness center: Treadmills do not have TV's.  
Spa: Steam room has no timer.  Drinking water warm and not infused with lemon/lime.   
Alcohol:  Weak drinks.  
Food:  very small quantities for some items.  
No fruitbasket in the room like usual.   
Not everyday a chocolate in the evening.  
Due to weather the cruise was diverted from the Shetlands.  
Breakfast time ended at 10AM. That is just too early. They need to  extend their hours to 11AM especially with the amount of senior citizens  they have on board. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, might that be the reason? It looks like these elderly cruisers had their fair share of cruising, pre-covid, and have gotten used to how it 'ought to be'. Mind you, the company was known to be more catered for the elderly with a bit more to spend, but due to covid most cruises had to figure out what to do. So most of them, including this company, changed, catering more for a broader audience. 

Do these cruisers have some valid points as well? Well, yes. To be fair,  I left out the founded complaints, but the ones I stated are, in my opinion, pretty unfounded.

So, is this cruise terrible? I do not think so. There are praising reviews as well. We looked at the pictures, watched some videos and yeah, I don't think we will hate this coming trip.

I just hope there will be no moaning/complaining people, having issues with these kinds of rather petty tings.

Then, after waiting for several minutes when our luggage was ready, hundreds of people were funneled into another room with tables and narrow aisles where the luggage was stacked so you could barely get through. And once you finally go your luggage, you had to go back through the funnel and through the room you were just waiting in which has even more people in it now make the process take even longer.

We're thinking of seeing Norway via cruise ship this year, and I've got to be honest I'm bamboozled by the array of options, hidden costs, mealtime slots/dress code, drinks packages, on-spend packages, gratuities, etc, etc, etc. What about parking at port? No-one seems to even talk about that on their websites!

This is all before I made the mistake of reading about the environmental impact and ridiculous working conditions and contracts for the staff. Is it really as bad as I'm making it out, or is there a set formula for what to expect which isn't as bad as my brain is telling me?

For example, ""Pay ¬£X for the initial trip, expect to pay ¬£Y per day in hidden costs/gratuities (how are these even added...? When do you pay for them...?), expect to smash your head, elbows and knees every day in your room (I'm 6""3'), expect to rush off and rush on the boat if you want to see anything when docked and expect to have to dine with willy-waving 'I've been on 69765 cruises!' types every night."".

Sneaky the snail had always dreamed of being a part of something bigger. He lived a quiet life in the garden, but he longed for adventure. So, when he heard about a cruise ship that was setting sail, he knew he had to be a part of it.

The problem was, Sneaky knew that he was just a snail. He wasn't exactly the kind of creature that people wanted to eat. But he was determined to be a part of the cruise, no matter what.

Sneaky hatched a plan. He would sneak aboard the ship and disguise himself as a fancy French snail dish. He spent weeks practicing his French accent and perfecting his recipe. When the day of the cruise finally arrived, Sneaky was ready.

He managed to sneak aboard the ship unnoticed, and he made his way to the kitchen. There, he introduced himself to the chefs as ""Sneaky le Escargot,"" a renowned snail chef from France. The chefs were skeptical at first, but Sneaky's charm and persistence won them over.

Before long, Sneaky's snail dishes were the talk of the ship. Everyone wanted to try a taste of ""le escargot,"" and Sneaky was thrilled to be a part of something so special.

Cruise,"Hello all, just wanted to chime in on my recent experience with Princess.

This was my fourth cruise of the year, and my first ever with Princess.  I had gone with Carnival twice and Royal once prior during the year.  

My main expectation was that the food quality would be much better on Princess to the point that I would not need to even consider ""safety"" choices like I did on Carnival and Royal.  Thankfully on Carnival Guy's Burgers was always a reliable safety...on Royal there were no safety options and it mattered quite a bit.  

On Princess, as expected, the food was such that I did not need to consider a safety even once.  I was generally not hungry at all throughout my time on the ship and ate only to see what the ship had to offer.  Of particular note was the little things...that the chocolate chip cookies they served at every buffet meal had melted chocolate chips and a pitcher of milk right next to them.  Every meal was like this.  All of the other food was well seasoned.  There was a rotating selection of either medallion steaks or similarly sized lamb chops or pork tenderloin at every meal that typically had rosemary seasoning and was cooked to perfection.  

I've come to the conclusion that MDR food is about the same throughout most of the lines, at least up to the premium level.  I've been satisfied with every line save Royal, and the problem with Royal was with their app and chaos come reservation time and not really about the food.  The food between Carnival, Royal, and Princess at the MDR was the same high standard of a medium to upper class dining experience.  I don't expect Michelin star level experiences, nor do I expect a simple mom and pop diner.

This was thankfully the case because they canceled two port calls, one in Jamaica and the other in the Caymans, and so we ended up spending 8 out of 11 days at sea, with port calls during the middle of the cruise at Cartegena, Panama, and Costa Rica.  

Because of the long lengths at sea, I can also say that their movie selection is great, they had all of the top movies that came out in 2022 and some indie movies too like Nomadland (wow that was depressing).  I ended up spending a lot more time watching movies in my cabin than I expected because so much time was spent at sea.  

Generally not that important to me is the ship design, but again with so much time at sea it became noticable...IMHO the designs on mid-tier Carnival and Royal ships was much better than Princess.  The Princess main outer deck had too much plexiglass to the point that it detracted from the look, and the interior did not have the 10+ deck atriums that Carnival and Royal both employ.  Overall a minor detail.

I took advantage of the port expert they have on Princess...I found it quite informative and was looking forward to especially the Caymans only to have the best ports canceled...what a bummer.

Overall I needed a lot of R&amp;R and got exactly that during this cruise.  I felt incredibly well rested and well fed by the end of it.  The lack of ports for nearly a week both at the beginning and the end of the cruise dragged quite a bit, but other than that it was a great cruise and will likely lean more towards Princess in the future, especially if price is comparable.  I lucked out on this one, this was by far the cheapest cruise of the year for me, during Christmas and on a premium line.",Recent Christmas Cruise on Caribbean Princess,,CQME,,0,2023-01-06 03:53:28

Cruise,"&amp;#x200B;

1st time cruiser but was in the company of a few families that are frequent cruisers and NCL loyalists so keep that in mind when you read the below review.

Pros:

1. New ship with an elegant design. Muted colors and materials exuding high quality were used all over

2. Indulge food hall offering multiple cuisines was a great concept though it got a bit repetitive by day #4. Make sure to take advantage of any 'Free At Sea' promos to add premium dining options like Palomar, Onda or Cagney's or else the rest of the food is meh.

3. Entertainment  - Syd Normans band was fun; especially on their Fleetwood Mac tribute night. Noise Boys put on an enthusiastic performance and the Island Sounds group put on a short but nice performance of a few  Bob Marley  and Harry Belafonte covers

4. The Observation Lounge was a beautiful well designed space; one of our favorites to hang around in as a group or to just chill out in at the end of the day

5. The onboard staff was just incredible; very hardworking and yet always cheerful. Every member from housekeeping to the waitstaff at restaurants and the bartenders were working their butts off and yet always had a smile on their face and greeted everyone by name. 

6. Seating areas on the 'Ocean Boulevard' on deck 8 were nicely designed with comfortable loungers, wicker sofas and swing chairs spread out by (tiny) infinity pools.

7. NCL premium drink package was worth the upgrade through the 'Free At Sea' promos. All the bartenders provided excellent service which made the package all the more worthwhile.

8. Balcony cabins were modern and felt larger than equivalent ships.

9. Prima Theater was a good venue that converted to a Vegas style nightclub.

Cons

10. Some of the elevators were not operational leading to long waits

11.Other than Indulge, the free food options were just average. The Main Dining Room menu stayed the same and the buffet at Surfside cafe was pretty small. They really try to get you to spend on the premium dining options.

12. While the cast of Donna Summer was great, that production did not come together for me. Standup comedy could've been better. Shows billed as different shared the same material.

13. Trying to book dining or shows together with friends was extremely frustrating. Could not cancel show or speciality dinner reservations via the app so there was little to no availability to book shows and dinner reservations when many of the speciality had empty seats at the times we attempted to visit.

14. This ship felt crowded everywhere from the Penrose atrium to the (intimate =crowded) Syd Normans and of course all of the swimming pools.

15. The main swimming pool was tiny - surely, they could have carved out more room for the pool and surrounding deck. It got extremely crowded there.

16. The Prima Speedway was a bit underwhelming as a pure go karting experience. They kept throttling the speeds and it just wasn't as enjoyable. Many of the VR machines in Galaxy Pavilion were not working when we attempted to access them.

17. Port Of Call Issues - For our sailing, Cozumel was called on Christmas Day which was also a Sunday. Our local (non NCL) guide told us that Cozumel typically doesn‚Äôt receive ships on Sundays and most of the shops take the day off. Besides, it was Christmas Day which meant further closures. So, we felt that NCL could have planned that stop better. And to top it off, the bad weather we encountered on the island made the day worse but that was Mother Nature doing her thing. 

Also, we skipped 2 of the 4 port of calls (Grand Cayman and GSC). Yes, the weather was bad at those ports of call so tendering was not possible. However, Royal Caribbean‚Äôs Freedom Of The Seas arrived at the Coco Cay  at the same time as the Prima reached GSC and still managed to dock while the Prima was a sea day for us dye to the winds! Yes, RCL paid for dredging and building out the port. If NCL doesn't want to go that route, they should have backup plans to route their ships to an alternate port of call like say Nassau. The windy conditions at GSC were known well in advance. Skipping GSC seems to be a fairly frequent occurrence so NCL ought to have backup plans in place.",NCL Prima Review sailing of 12/23,,swiftaccord,,0,2023-01-05 21:41:37

Cruise,"Hi everyone,

I've been wanting to go on a cruise for many years after hearing stories from my parents when I was younger. My family and I are finally going on one in late February and we're super excited about it (I'm probably the most excited of the bunch). 

We're going on a 7 day cruise on Celebrity Reflection going to the Caribbean that sends us to the Bahamas, Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Mexico. In being a first time cruiser, I did a mistake of booking directly through the cruise line website and don't have a travel agent to help me.

In researching visa requirements to each country, I now find myself in need for someone's help or advice. I'm Canadian, so that's easy but my wife is Chinese so that's not as easy. Since she's a Canadian Permanent Resident (previously Landed immigrant), Bahamas, Jamaica and Mexico are fine; Grand Cayman (or Cayman Islands), I'm not so sure.

Their website is kind of all over the place so I'm not certain so hopefully someone has had my experience before and can confirm what I should do. From what I read, a Canadian (or USA) visa holder does not need a Visa if they are arriving directly from Canada or USA and leaving directly to Canada or USA. We are leaving for Fort Lauderdale but first go to Bahamas and Jamaica before docking in Grand Cayman.

If we have to get a Visa, we have to drive to Ottawa (about 2.5 hours from us) to go to a UK prefered provider and spend about 300$ CAD to get said Visa.

Has anyone had similar experience? If so, did you need to get a visa for a &lt;12 hour visit to Cayman Island?

They are offering reimbursement for the initial 7 days although it is no where close to the value that I think it should be.

Good: 
- buffet food is not bad
- price of the cruise is cheap
- brand new ship. This won‚Äôt last, as 1 month in and I could see a lot of wear and tear.

Bad:
- MSC did a fairly bad job at communicating last minute changes to their cruise terminal. It was supposed to be at terminal F, then changed to terminal D. Didn‚Äôt find out until we got to the port. This information should come through MSC.
- dining room crew seems poorly trained. Throwing utensils down, hitting people‚Äôs heads accidentally when they clean up. Blocking entire corridors in the buffet to have conversations with each other during rush hour.
- too many passengers. Elevators are inefficient. 
- onboard amenities is mediocre versus RCI, Carnival, NC. Other modern cruise ships offer more fun.
- internet package is tied to a single MAC address and can‚Äôt be changed.

The first 9days on the ship were great. Good food on in MDR (lamb chops, duck, lobster bisque, et Al). Elevators and pool were crowded but being a holiday cruise that was expected. However‚Ä¶..
We observed starting day 8 food in buffet tasted rancid. Fruits were not tasting good so we started eating in MDR. My husband had a Caesar salad on 31st in the MDR and came down with food poisoning. We are talking continuous vomiting and diarrhea. He was so weak I had to take him to medical center and they hooked him up to iv for 2hours. They tested and confirmed he got stomach infection. We missed out on going out to DR on 1st Jan and he was miserable.
On 1st Jan lunch my 18mo old had French fries (he ate fries and chicken nugget almost daily for lunch). After nap, he started vomiting 8 times and fainted. We took him to medical center and they tried to find his nerve 3 times for iv but could not. At this point they tested and confirmed he also got food poisoning and gave some pedialyte for him. We spent the last night miserable and worried for my son.
We got a bill for 3.9k for the treatment but I had trip insurance so hopefully it will be covered.

Cruise,"I'm currently aboard MSC Meraviglia, and the food is worse than my last cruise on the Seashore, which was, in turn, worse than my previous cruise on the Meraviglia.

The food -- both choice and quality -- is, to be blunt, terrible. 

For this cruise line to be successful long-term sailing from U.S. ports, it is going to have to adapt its menu more in line with American tastes. 

Foods I've seen on the buffet this week include  pasta salad with frankfurters, salmon pasta sauce that resembled lumpy Pepto-Bismol, shrimp pot pie, mussel pot pie, and many other dishes Americans just find strange at best and completely unappetizing at worst. The MDR dinner menu is, likewise, lacking in food appealing to American passengers. The food has been the talk of the ship this week, and not in a positive manner. 

I'm currently ""enjoying"" an Asian rice salad and trying to figure out whether it's the black olives, the red bell peppers, the white onion, or the sweet vinaigrette that makes it ""Asian."" I've decided it's simply the rice. Rice equals Asian, right?

On my previous MSC cruises, the consolation was that I could find one reliable meal a day at lunch in the MDR. Unfortunately, lunch had not been served in the dining room at all on this cruise. Is this a fluke or a fleet wide change? My cynical side imagines it's an attempt to push passengers toward paid options at lunch, in concert with the new $150+ unlimited specialty dining package. 

For now, this is most certainly my last MSC cruise. But I'm hoping the line can figure out the American palate and I can return someday.

Cruise,"Just got this email regarding our upcoming cruise in April.   I usually let the autopay while on the cruise but will likely prepay before 4/1 this time to save some $.  

I know the daily gratuity is a touchy subject on this forum.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion which I respect.   I am from the school of thought that the daily gratuity is for the hard working crew and should be considered as part of the cost of cruising.  Having the gratuities removed from your portfolio is not a cruise or system hack.  It affects the crew‚Äôs livelihood and also those of us who actually pay what is expected (The more cruisers opt out will lead to more increases to cover the shortfall)

Cruise,"I live in Miami and have been on ~15 cruises.. mostly RCL/Celebrity along with MSC and also tried Norwegian..

Never even considered Carnival with the image that it was the ""Walmart"" of cruises catering to rednecks/ghetto.. that was just my prejudice I've held forever- not sure why but the media reports of brawls and also look of older ships really threw me off..

FAST FORWARD- reviews of the Mardi Gras in 2021 got my interest as it looked modern and something more similar to RCL.. i ended up booking 7 nights on the brand new CELEBRATION for the New Years cruise with my family wife+ 2 small kids

WOW!! that's all I can say.. the best cruise ever.. they completely hit a home run with the design of the ship and overall package..  Food OMG A+ so many options/ included venues.. unbelievable.. everything spanking new.. so many shows/performances.. entire setup with the app makes it all perfect.. 

The real loser here is Royal Carribean because they are now way behind the curve. I was Oasis of the Seas last summer a ""amplified/renovated"" ship and it doesn't compare at all.. RCL Freedom of the Seas /Independence are the real ""Walmart of the Seas""

Carnivals new CELEBRATION/ Mardi Gras is a whole new level. I honestly felt the food including buffet/dining room was the best i had ever been seen- even superior to Celebrity Silhouette/Summit I've experienced .

Cruise,"This post is in case anyone here can benefit from my mistake.


&amp;nbsp;

**Short version**  

- Booked a cruise on the Princess website  
- At the scheduled time, Princess did not take any deposit off the credit card on file.
- Princess then cancelled the booking without any notification.  
- I had to call them and spend hours to get it re-booked.  


&amp;nbsp;

**Long Version**  

- Booked my first Caribbean cruise in late Nov. online using the Princess website.
- Booked flights separately
- Assumed that the mandatory deposits would be taken automatically off the credit card on file (just like airfare, hotels, etc.)  
- Carefully read all Princess confirmations/docs
- Contacted Princess the day after booking to ensure everything was in order.
- Was never advised I had to ""manually"" pay my deposits by calling them or using their website (which crashes a lot)
- During the busy holidays, never noticed the charges were not taken off the card.
- While reconfirming my cruise on the website 2 days ago, found out that my reservation was cancelled.
- No warning or notification was sent by email, text or call.
- Yesterday, called Princess and spoke to seven people.
- Here's how it went...  
&amp;nbsp; 

**Person 1 - Customer Service Agent**  

- I explain my situation.  
- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled but I have to call you back in 5 hours so that the right department can help you.""  
- No call back was ever received.  So after seven hours, I call them back.  

**Person 2 - Customer Service Agent**  

- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc.  Your reservation is cancelled.  Can I book you another cruise?""  
- I said yes, same cruise, same day.   
- Without explanation, they transfer me to to someone else.  

**Person 3 - Customer Service Agent**  

- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled. Can I book you another cruise?""  
- I said yes and finally expressed some frustration with the process. I said I want the same cruise booked and if not I would post about it on social media. I regret saying this because they replied:  
- ""Thank you for the threats.  Have a great day""  and hung up on me.  

**Person 4 - Customer Service Agent**  

- For fear of being hung up on again, I go back to a ""chill"" approach
- I asked to speak to a supervisor.  
- They still ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled. Can I book you another cruise?""  
- They then transfer me to a supervisor.  

**Person 5 - Supervisor**  

- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled. Can I book you another cruise?""  
- They say they can re-book me but they have to transfer me again.  
- Side note: I doubt this was a supervisor.  

**Person 6 - Customer Service Agent**  

- This person was the first person who showed empathy and projected confidence and skill.  
- Again, I had to provide all my information. (why they don't warm transfer, I don't know)
- This person quickly copied my booking and could book the same cruise for an additional $300.  
- I thanked this person for their expertise and tell them how happy I am.   
- I ask if I can get the same rate but they said I would need to speak with ""Guest Services""  
- They transfer me, but they also very kindly share their contact info with me for next time I call.  

**Person 7 - Guest Services/Customer Support**  

- When they answer, I ask if this is ""Guest Services"", but they said ""No this is Customer Support"".  
- This person was very cold but managed in about 2 min to simply re-instate my cancelled reservation and finally process my payment.  
- When I mention the original problem regarding the deposit, they simply said I should have made a deposit on their website.
- Then they ask: ""Anything else?""  
- I say thanks and have a nice day.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusions:**  

- Next time, book with a travel agent.  
- I also had quite a few issues with both their website and medallion app.
- I don't have a super nice feeling about this cruise anymore.","Princess Cancelled Booking Without Warning (Newbie post, lengthy call centre summary)",,ReelDeadOne,,0,2023-01-03 17:11:09

One question I have is what percentage of passengers are Western compared to local cultures? Every culture has slightly different social behavior (as in Americans navigate a crowd very differently from Italians, that kind of thing), so I'm curious if you noticed any differences in how passengers acted. 


Butting up against that question, how different was the cruise itself from a European or Caribbean cruise? I'm perfectly happy being the only Western passenger on the ship, but it's a different story if all the announcements are in local languages and the entertainment and food specifically caters to local tastes.

I only just found out about this but Norwegian, Carnival and Royal Caribbean all offer onboard credits to shareholders.

Certainly worth looking into if you are an existing shareholder, not sure I'd advise buying shares just for the credits unless maybe you're young and plan on sailing with one line in the future.

I‚Äôve done all of the major lines before, a lot of cruising from a kid to a young adult.

But Virgin‚Ä¶is a class of its own. A world of difference that just feels good to be a part of.

Pros:
- no kids, or parents stressed about their kids, or ice cream running down the pool deck all day. It‚Äôs just blissful.

- vibe. They have areas for all people. You want chill? Hammock on your balcony. You want to get day drunk poolside? Shake your phone and champagne is inbound. Live music? Cool head down to on the rocks. House / pop music? Poolside or manor is your vibe.

- the guests. This was by FAR the best part. It‚Äôs literally like cherry picking the best people from other lines. There was almost zero ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù moments. Because it‚Äôs a premium line, most people are well off and worldly. There‚Äôs no judgement.

- the crew. They get paid like 3x the other lines, and are encouraged to be themselves. They swear, they dance, they enjoy each others company. And their tips are included, so they never are scrounging for more.

- the food. The galley is a league of its own for buffets. All the specialty‚Äôs minus test kitchen were absolutely incredible for cruise food. They don‚Äôt really batch much so it‚Äôs much more made to order food.

- the events. Scarlet night. I will leave it at that. BUT pro tip, bring something that you won‚Äôt mind getting wet.

Now to rephrase, ONE CONSIDERATION. First of all I‚Äôm all about people loving people. In whatever form that looks like. But if you are not comfortable with LGBTQ+ folks, stay away. There were men in thongs poolside twerking on each other. If this makes you uncomfortable, don‚Äôt go.

For me, there is no contest.

Pros:

- no kids, and because of that, no parents stressing over kids, the vibe is so incredibly different

- they have vibes for everyone, want to chill on your balcony and read a book? Here‚Äôs a hammock. Want to get day drunk at the pool? Have some champagne and comfiest day beds ever. House music at the pool, jazz music inside. 

- the spaces. Everything just feels ‚Äúgood‚Äù like nothing is cheap. Dinner chairs, lounge chairs, bar stools, glassware, it‚Äôs all just high quality 

- the crew. Because they are allowed to be themselves (can swear, and really just not be ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù), they are so much fun to be around. Also the pay makes them not be scrounging for tips so much.

- the fellow travellers. This is a premium line for progressive folks. People are well off and well travelled. Met some of the best people ever.

Cruise,"I've been on both and have thoughts and questions.  

Thoughts regarding food: Breakfast buffet was superior on NCL. Celebrity had more options, but the overall taste was better on NCL. Lunch was an even wash between the two. Dinner had Celebrity winning hands down. To the extent that if I take another NCL cruise I will make it a point to eat at only the specialty restaurants as the MDR was meh at best.

Shows/entertainment: I found to be equal on both ships. Both had amazing shows and an abundance of trivia/other entertainment. NCL had a much louder DJ by the pool, to its detriment, but had better nightlife.

Service: Here Celebrity wins hands down. The bar at NCL was always packed and there were never enough poolside attendants. The ""anytime"" dining also had the service pretty terrible at dinner as well. Stateroom attendants were both wonderful.

My question: Is the service on NCL that I experienced normal? The NCL cruise I was on was a 3 night fully booked while Celebrity was a 5 night at half capacity. Would I expect similar service had Celebrity been fully booked as well? I'm tempted to book NCL for a longer cruise, pay extra for specialty dining, and see if what I experienced was a one off, but if it's standard I'm going to be pretty ticked off. I like the ship options better on NCL, which is why I'm considering them again. But hubby and I are in our 40's and service is a pretty big deal for us.

Cruise,"So in Oct/Nov time I did a back to back Mexico cruise 12 days total all in Haven on NCL Bliss. I only did it as I scored a significant discount from being a rated player with Casinos at Sea. 

The room I had was a forward penthouse suite which which is in the VERY front of the ship. There in the corners up front. The other set of Haven rooms they have are in the actual Haven area. My room was on the 10th floor. Haven facilities are actually on the 17th floor if I remember correctly. 

So did I like it..yes and no. Room was huge. Separate living room, dining room area (small), full sized king bed and a TON of storage area. Bathroom was enormous. I also go to Vegas often and would equate the feel to a small mini suite if I was in Vegas. 

The room itself had a butler assigned but its not your personal butler she/he is assigned to many rooms but always available. 

So the issue I had was I rarely used the actual Haven area. I would have to walk 1/4 the way down the ship and catch the elevator up. The times I did I did check it out and had several meals there. 

The Haven area itself has its own bar and bartender that. A ton of seating like its a lounge. The pool in it there is a retractable roof and you can also go outside where they have there own deck area. There is a Vape/Smoking area up there as well. 

The dining was superb and faster then most fast food in my opinion. Whatever I ordered it was like instantly served. The part I did not like is 15 people asking me if I needed anything which happened every meal. Ended up not eating their anymore due to that. 

Never used the pool area but I could see how it was nice. Its quite. 

There own part of the observation deck is nice. Very quite. 

I get comped rooms in Vegas and NCL but I am not into being treated frilly wise. Very very easy customer to deal with. When the Haven people saw me they were suprised to see me lol. Thats how infrequently I used their facilities. I'm a low key person. I do not equate the high life being catered on in the least. 

Internet sucked and sucked badly. I would not even ponder paying NCL Bliss if I went on that boat again one cent for internet. The only time I could use my work computer to remote in was when I would hot spot my puck to the local Mexican 4g network. 

So some of the frills of being Haven is check in. They take you right up instantly about with no wait. Disembarking for excursions or what not is a elevator in Haven area that takes you right to the exit and your off first. Making any reservations for spa, food they handle it all.

So I decided to call NCL and ask why it looks like we paid so much more for the cruise, when it's being discounted a lot online.

2) is there anywhere we can get ice to take to our room (like one of the restaurants?) to chill the drinks? Do we have to bring our own wine glasses?

3) How do you settle your bill? I hear everything is in US prices but it's better to be billed in USD instead of letting them convert it to your local currency because the conversion rate sucks. How does it work though? Do I just manually settle the bill on the last day and that's when I tell them to bill me in USD? Or do they just automatically deduct my credit card? 

4) I hear that there are theme nights where we can all dress up - both in costume and formally. How do we find out about these so we know what to dress up as?",A few questions about Royal Caribrean cruise,,your-lost-elephant,,0,2022-12-28 13:14:48

Cruise,"I recently took my first cruise with NCL on the pride of America for the entire island Hawaii cruise over Thanksgiving. This is I believe my 18th cruise, have sailed on carnival and RCCL pretty evenly.

My friend that I traveled with has sailed several times with Norwegian and she did say everything that she read said that this ship was the worst in their fleet.

Long story short, we had some good times but also some very disappointing times such as our stop to Kawai getting canceled because of wind even though every other island was windy as well.

So when I received the follow up email after the cruise I filled the survey out and actually had to attach a document because my comments were so long it would not fit in the comment box. And I received an email today in response and I think this email alone would convince me to give Norwegian another try. Not only did they apologize for several things, they also took the time to acknowledge each and every item that I pointed out from a very disappointing and somewhat misleading shore excursion to the mediocre food and service in the dining room and the overall experience. 

They put a $50 credit on both mine and my friends account so on a future cruise we will get $50 off which is really nothing in the grand scheme of things but still a nice gesture. They also refunded both of us 50% for our disappointing shore excursion which was close to $250 Per person. I think their response and those actions alone would get me to consider them for a future cruise however I wasn‚Äôt really impressed with all the ‚Äúfree‚Äú at Sea when we still had to pay service charges and gratuities etc. However we were able to cancel our beverage package the first day since we hadn‚Äôt used it yet so we got money back there as well because especially in Hawaii when you‚Äôre on an island every day for most of the day unless you were doing quite a bit of drinking in the evening at dinner you‚Äôre really not getting your moneys worth (although this is coming from someone who rarely drinks so multiple beers or glasses of wine or cocktails would wreck me).",Use those feedback/survey emails!,,reb6,,0,2022-12-28 03:50:24

Cruise,"We (47m + 42f) did a week on P&amp;O Azura last week as a (relatively) cheap winter break.

We usually cruise with Royal Caribbean as we like the range of activities and entertainment. We  found that P&amp;O was a lot quieter and more formal. Possibly due to time of year, the majority of guests were senior citizens and quite reserved. The on-board activities were definitely aimed at an older crowd.

The stage shows were of a very high standard and the theatre was really good with some of the best stage sets that we've seen at sea. In addition to the production shows, there was an Adele tribute and a three-man vocal harmony group.

The ship is well designed with some very stylish interior design (a lot less brassy than Royal). We had booked an interior room, but were bumped to an ocean view, mid-ships on deck eight. Although the room was the same size as the interior room, the natural light and abundance of mirrors made it feel bigger. The room layout also maximised the available space.

There were signs of post-covid cost cutting in the lack of choices on the menus and the rooms only been made ip once per day. There were also quite a few stock shortages in the bars (no single malts available), which seems strange when most businesses have returned to normal. 

Overall, it was a nice cruise but we wouldn't be tempted to pick P&amp;O for our main vacation.",Obligatory sunset photos from last week's Canary Islands and Madeira cruise on P&amp;O Azura. Read the comments for a mini review.,,IGSketchUK,,0,2022-12-27 18:28:01
Cruise,"TL;DR version: Is Celebrity always this unfriendly to solos?

On paper, Celebrity is the perfect fit - my age, education level, income, and activity preferences all fit the demographics. After several cancellations due to you-know-what, I finally got onboard a Celebrity ship. And‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not impressed. 

To be fair, I‚Äôm on a Christmas cruise, specifically the Apex one to the western Caribbean. Holiday cruises are not typical and I did expect a certain level of chaos beyond what is normal. However, it‚Äôs not the kids or crowds that are the issue. It‚Äôs the service. 

I‚Äôm sailing solo as I always do. I‚Äôm in a cabin designed for solos, which is comfortable (albeit low on storage). But the cabin hadn‚Äôt been prepped properly - the fridge not been cleaned (ew, cheese cubes and soup?) or restocked, I didn‚Äôt get the famous Celebrity shopping tote, and FFS, the desk chair was missing.

While NCL crew is accustomed to solos, I also felt welcome on RC and Princess. Here on Apex, there is a noticeable difference between how the dining staff around the ship has treated me compared to adjacent tables. I‚Äôm grateful to Ritesh and Raj at Normandie for making me feel visible again last night.

Someone forgot to tell the Eden staff about the (only) scheduled solo gathering there. We eventually found each other without their help (which they didn‚Äôt offer anyway). 

I did submit comments via the guest services form. Someone called a few hours later to apologize for the painfully slow internet (which was just an offhand mention at the end of my survey) and upgrade me to premium. Not a word about my other concerns. So at least now I can watch YouTube to pass the time while being ignored? 

Apex is gorgeous. I‚Äôm chilling out in my usual spot in Eden. The food and live music are fab. Life isn‚Äôt bad - I mean, I‚Äôm on a cruise and these are very much first world problems. I‚Äôm already booked on what should be a more typical experience (on Solstice) because as I said, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to be representative. But good grief. I‚Äôm low maintenance and endlessly polite &amp; patient, but do I need to Karen it up to get service here? That isn‚Äôt an option. 

Since my company shuts down between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Day, it‚Äôs an opportunity to cruise without dipping into vacation time. I‚Äôm doing it again next year, but on NCL where I won‚Äôt be greeted by the waiter with ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ I see.

We were recently on Oasis of the Seas. Last time we‚Äôd been to St Thomas, we‚Äôd docked at the West India Company dock, this time we docked at Crown Bay and totally threw off our plans for the day.

I was watching a YouTube video about people spending a month on a cruise ship and they had complained that if they‚Äôd known where one of their ports actually was, in relation to their intended destination, they‚Äôd probably have stayed on the ship. Which is similar to our experience in St Thomas. Someone on their chat said there was a site that provided all this info, but it was never specified.

Cruise,"I just sailed on the NCL Bliss (7-Day from Miami - Departed 12/17). This was my first time cruising with NCL, and as the title suggested, this will certainly be my last. These are just a few of the reasons why:

- The customer service was abysmal. The guest services line was always 15+ people deep. 
- I attempted to make reservations at some of the specialty dining restaurants on the first day of the cruise and was told that all but 2 of the restaurants were booked solid for the entire trip. The only ones with availability were Food Republic and Los Lobos (Mexican) and neither called my attention. I find it ridiculous that none of the other restaurants could accommodate us during the whole sailing (it‚Äôs not like I waited til the last day to reserve a spot!)
- The food in the main dining venues (Manhattan, Taste, Savor) was awful. I ate at those restaurants every day (since I couldn‚Äôt reserve a spot at the speciality dining spots), and I only recall one memorable dish the whole trip. The food always seemed to be cold (except for the salad - who doesn‚Äôt love warm lettuce?!), the waiters seemed to always mess up the order and the food lacked consistency from one day to the next. Also, the food always took an eternity! One night, dinner was literally 2 hours and 45 minutes long. If I was at any normal restaurant, I would have stormed off. Terrible. 
- I‚Äôve been on half a dozen cruises and I‚Äôve NEVER seen a cruise so crowded! I wasn‚Äôt able to get into the jacuzzis all cruise long because people were practically spilling out of them. The lines at the buffet were utter chaos. Good luck finding a pool chair if you‚Äôre not up by 7am. I wasnt able to secure a single seat at the comedy club venue the WHOLE cruise, and was only able to reserve a viewing of SIX (Jersey Boys was fully booked for all showings).
- The itinerary was changing without anyone being informed of the changes ahead of time. The switched the order of the ports of call and reduced the amount of time we had in each port. 
- Embarkation and disembarkation were both delayed for some reason with no explanation given. I was supposed to embark at 10:30am and didn‚Äôt get on the ship until 4pm.
- This company nickel and dimes you for everything! Everything is an added fee, additional cost, and they upsell you every chance they get. I received a voicemail on my phone every single day trying to get me to pre-book my next cruise with NCL. The audacity (given the circumstances). 
- The crew was clueless. Bless their hearts, some of them were lovely, but I couldn‚Äôt get a straight answer to a single question during my entire cruise. It‚Äôs like NCL doesn‚Äôt train their staff. I had a different waiter for dinner every night (despite going to the same main dining venues every day), no towel animals in the rooms, and I didn‚Äôt even learn the name of a single person on the ship, as no one introduced themselves. I recalled always receiving a warm greeting from my room attendant on both RC and Carnival; but on NCL, I don‚Äôt even think I ever saw the person who cleaned my room once. 

I can go on, but I think you‚Äôve gotten the gist by now. For context, I‚Äôve been on a total of 6 cruises before this one (3 with Royal, 3 with Carnival) and I‚Äôve always had a pleasant experience with both companies.

I will never cruise with NCL again, and I will tell all my friends to run for the hills if they even mention NCL in conversation.

Cruise,"I am a 40yo Canadian female that will be travelling solo. I've been on a few cruises in the past (RCCL x 3, Holland x 1) so know what to expect from a cruise - but have never been on one solo. I am looking at 7 day Caribbean end of Jan 2023 that aren't unreasonable for solo traveller (Holland, Celebrity, Princess don't seem to be good options) and don't go to places I've already been. 

I found 3 options.

1. RCCL - 7 Day Southern: Barbados (been before), Tobago, Trinidad, Grenada, St Vincent, Dominica, St. Lucia (been before), Barbados. I can get an Interior Room for \~ $1200 CAD, with no drink package, wifi, etc. I would need to book ASAP as it's a sale price. I don't know what the RCCL Drink Package and Wifi Pricing is to properly compare apples to apples but I can only assume it'll be closer to NCL pricing.
2. MSC - 7 Day: Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Netherlands Antilles, Antigua (been before) and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis. I can get a Premium Interior with Wifi &amp; drink package for \~ $1300 or a balcony for a bit more w/o Wifi &amp; Drinks.
3. NCL - 7 Day: San Juan Puerto Rico (been before), Oranjestad Aruba, Willemstad Cura√ßao, Kralendijk Bonaire, Castries St. Lucia (been before), Basseterre St Kitts, San Juan Puerto Rico. I can get a Solo Studio w/ access to Studio Lounge, Drink Package, Wifi, Speciality Dining and Excursion Discounts for \~$1500. 

With pricing being roughly comparable, room size, etc and I've read all the pros/cons of each of the lines, I think my decision is more around the ports. As you can see they are pretty different. 

A lot of the RCCL Ports don't have great reviews on cruise review websites. Have you been to any of these ports? What are some things you liked/didn't like?

* I want to feel safe as a solo female traveller
* I don't want to spend too much on excursions (NCL seems to have free? or at least $50 USD credit per excursion).
* I like seeing the parks, view points, hiking around vs walking the same ole cruise ship company owned shops or lying on the beach.

Cruise,"Overall great trip. Last sailed on Harmony out of Port Canaveral in March so most of my opinions compare it to that trip.

Port Miami is a MESS compared to Canaveral, but mostly expected that because it is Miami. 10:30 boarding ti.e so planned to get to port about 10 to allow time for parking etc.  Pulled up to tunnel and it was closed. Had to do a U-turn but between construction, Monday work traffic, and Google maps not letting me pick another route, we ended up back at the closed tunnel for a second U-turn. Third time tunnel was open and we got through extremely slowly. Plan for extra time here as traffic with 6 ships leaving and being downtown Miami made it a loooong wait for lots of folks sailing that day. 

Food was pretty good. Wind jammer was typically good, but very crowded especially for breakfast. We preferred MDR for breakfast  as wind jammer was just super crowded. Never felt crowded on Harmony over spring break, but enjoyed that layout for Windjammer over Freedom. 

Ate at MDR every night. Always good, no real bad dishes. Bread at table was just ok (why can't they have the pumpkin seed bread every night?!?!). Prime rib and tenderloin were excellent. Shrimp app was a bit disappointing with super small size shrimp and lackluster dip. Lentil soup was great. Desserts were always great, although creme brulee was a bit jello rather than smooth creme. Still flavor was great. 

Shows were really good. Ice show is an ice show, probably my least favorite of the trip but still worth a watch. Marquee was good, a bit long in the tooth for the song selection for my kids but it's an ode to classic Broadway so I get it. Once Upon A Time was better than Marquee. We all enjoyed it's more modern selection of songs somewhat related to old fairy tales. 

Highlight of shows was Mo5aic acapella group. They put in a fantastic show that we all enjoyed. They even joined the singer at the pub later that evening for more singing, taking requests, interacting with guests. Was a great night with those guys. 

Coco cay was great, even if wind limited snorkeling over at Chill Island.  We got to South Beach early and it was great. Calm waters a bit chilly, but definitely swimmable. Even as crowd from Chill Island made it's way over, it never felt too crowded. We skipped water park this time to enjoy the island. Kids would prefer the water park, but still thoroughly enjoyed South Beach and the free kids plays areas. Had snack shack for lunch and it was solid. Walked through buffet and kinda regretted not eating there as it looked really good. Ended up trying the Philly steak sandwich and it was pretty solid. 

Pool decks on board were very nice. Splashaway Bay for the kids was awesome compared to the tiny version on Harmony. Slides and flow rider were great, although a bit odd separate from the rest of the pool areas. Felt weird having to walk back and forth, but minor gripe. Really liked the enclosed stairs to the slides versus the open air stairs on Harmony. Can get very windy that high up!

Promenade was nice, but felt a bit cramped versus Harmony. Never really crowded perse, but if anything was going on in promenade, it definitely bottle necked things. Harmony just seemed to provide the extra elbow room with the wider promenade. 

Had an Ultra Spacious Ocean View room that was awesome. Was myself, wife, and 3 kids (14, 12, 9) and we were very comfortable. Had a little room with bunk beds for little 2 and the couch converted to bed for the 14 year olds still never felt cramped or in top of each other. We typically get connected balconies but this was often better and the extra floor space felt more like a normal hotel room. Decor ideas sna bit dated, but didn't hurt anything either. 

Seas were a bit rough most trip. Definitely felt the rocking especially overnight. Not sure if that is ship size or just luck with weather ( very windy everywhere). 

Nassau was Nassau. Headed to Margaritaville and really enjoyed it. Staff there was super friendly. Had access to their pools, water slides, rock climbing, flow rider, cliff jumping pool, and semi-private beach. Was definitely better than fighting crowds over in the public side. Getting there was terrible as always between the construction and the typical bombardment of various hawkers. Never fun for me!

Cruise,"So my wife and I are going on our first cruise coming up in January and we had a few questions.

1) I didn't see any meals listed as Formal Dining in our reservation on the Royal Caribbean app. Is there a certain day/meal that should be formal, or does our cruise NOT have a formal meal? Also, what is appropriate attire for male and female cruisers on Royal Caribbean cruises?

2) I noticed that two of the ports (Haiti and Jamaica) are considered Level 3/4 on the US State Departments website as places not to travel to. Are the Royal Caribbean ships still docking in those locations and if so, are we safe as long as we stay in the group for the excursions? If they DO cancel, I'm assuming they'll issue a refund for all excursions booked through their app. If so, how quickly does the refund process? 

3) For the cruise and excursions, should we take cash, traveller's cheques, or just use our debit and credit cards? Do they accept US currency on the islands or will we need to exchange it? Also, what should we tip for while on the ship and while in port?

4) Last one I can think of right now, if we didn't want to do any of the excursions, are we still able to just hang out at a beach for free or do some sightseeing/shopping in the town around the ship?

If there's any tips you might have for someone's first time, it would also be appreciated.

Cruise,"I just recently booked my 1st ever cruise for March 2023 going to the Caribbean. I was wondering if anyone could answer a few questions regarding this ship / cruise line!

*** I am in my mid 20s and aware this cruise line caters to a much older crowd usually.. I purposely selected this cruise line to try and have the most peaceful trip I could**

1) Can I bring wine on board? If so, how many bottles? Would there be a corkage fee if I were to have it in my cabin?

2) Can I bring sealed snacks on board?

3) How late is the casino open?

4) In the main dining room, is the food unlimited without extra cost?

5) Does housekeeping come to the rooms everyday?

6) Should I bring any cash?

7) Is the thermal spa pass worth it? What does it have to offer?

I noticed that selecting the free at sea open bar option while on the checkout screen for booking a stateroom they charge a $200 dollar gratuity fee.

I ended up booking WITHOUT the drink package, looking in the app it now costs $1177 to add it on. ($109x9days+20%gratuity)

Im having a hard time wrapping my head around this, can someone explain what the bill would look like if I had booked with the open bar in the beginning? Do they bill you for the $109 per day at the end of the cruise? or would you essentially be getting the $1177 package for only $200?

Cruise,"I booked a NCL cruise early October that‚Äôs 10 days out now. The first stop is Ocho Rios Jamaica. Unfortunately, I just saw a news article that came out yesterday about the travel advisory from the US state department warning travelers about the level 4 do not travel status to certain parts of the country. This included the parish Ocho Rios is in, more specifically Steer Town, which is where the majority of the excursions offered through the ship go.
I called the standard reservations desk regarding this yesterday, and the associate and manager couldn‚Äôt give me any reasoning as to why they are still going to this port. All they could say was that they deem it as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and they have supposedly ‚Äúreviewed everything.‚Äù
I was referred to their corporate office, who still wouldn‚Äôt give me any additional information as to how they arrive to the decision, contradicting what the US state department and other independent sources have arrived to.
The only additional preventative measure that they are providing as a safety precaution is potentially having a Norwegian cruise line employee join any excursion. They also brought up the fact that you will be in a group. Ultimately, they did not give any substantial reasoning to make me feel particularly safe.
The lady I was talking to also tried to tell me that they aren‚Äôt going to the area that has the travel advisory. I told her that is untrue, to which she seem to sort of backtrack her statement when I called her out on the lie with evidence. 
I asked if I can cancel my reservation for the entire cruise, as I don‚Äôt see as much value when I‚Äôm losing a port. At the same time, it feels like I‚Äôm taking a gamble with my life to get what I paid for. Unfortunately, they said I would face the cancellation penalty of the full amount, minus gratuities, and excursions.
I am just so surprised that the cruise line not only is ignoring a major governmental body‚Äôs guidelines, but cannot give any meaningful reasoning as to why they have elected to do so. There are surely plenty other ports they could go to‚Äîor perhaps just go to the next port on the route and stay there a couple days instead. Safety doesn‚Äôt seem to be a priority.

My latest cruise was to Nassau on Conquest. 

Here is what we experienced:
- We didn‚Äôt leave the port around 7:30 give or take. The reason why we couldn‚Äôt leave is because someone had a suitcase consisting of guns and drugs. I mean how in the hell does someone get guns past security. And what was this person planning? That is a very scary thought in crowded areas. 
- Our cabin was a few doors down from some rowdy cruisers. Now, I don‚Äôt mind rowdy cruisers generally speaking because I think it‚Äôs good to let loose and have some fun, but there are limits. While sitting in the balcony we started to smell some strong weed. So much so that we had to go inside the cabin and close the door. I called the front desk and told them about it, and they asked ‚Äúdid you see the person smoking?‚Äù  I said ‚Äúno‚Äù, but you should send someone up to the floor to investigate. Nothing was done.
- Same group seem to have brought on board some way to play some loud music from their cabin. 2am in the morning and we heard loud music. No respect for anyone when people are trying to sleep.

These 3 days are great to do a quick getaway , but man‚Ä¶they come with some warnings and buyer beware. Typically we‚Äôre playing Roulette for hours in the Casino and we‚Äôll do an excursion, which kinda shields us from the pool area where you hear about crazy stories.

Ironically enough, it's his absolute reverence and addiction to cruising that has completely soured the concept for my spouse and I, who have never been on one. I've never had anything against it really, but it never looked particularly interesting either. I'm also wary of anything anyone says is ""perfect for everyone"" because people are waaay too variable.

But I think my vague indifference and my husband's outright refusal is just egging him on like it's a challenge. He asks non-stop, tries to convince me to ""work on"" my husband behind his back (which pisses him off), won't take no for an answer. (I'll add that while they're civil, he and my husband haven't had the smoothest relationship and a cruise isn't going to change that). The subject of cruises has even been banned multiple times, but it doesn't last more than 5 minutes before talk about ""Ship X is going to Y"" or ""they have a huge mall"" or whatever.

Cruise," 

Just a few minutes ago there was an announcement of man overboard, port side. Before that were three long blasts of the electronic horn.

People began running to the sides to investigate, although it's night time. We're outside of Cuba heading back to port in Miami.

We have all just been instructed to return to our cabins.

Edit: A crew member came to our cabin and told us we had to close our balcony door and draw the blinds. I'm not sure why.

Edit 2: They just allowed us to leave our cabins.

Thanks to another redditor in the comments, we were more reliable informed that a passenger fell from his balcony and landed on deck 8 on the port side. They did not survive. Police will board tomorrow when we return to port to investigate.

From the post: ""We just had 3 emergency blasts at dinner, then the captain came on ‚ÄúMan overboard starboard side‚Äù. Many went to help look for him and saw something awful. Looked like a body on Deck 8. Unclear what happened but pray for his/her family. We were all sent to our cabins.¬†""

Edit 3: *FINAL UPDATE*

It is with a great deal of sadness that reliable updates have revealed what happened. It would appear as though a 15-year-old passenger was part of a disagreement with his family. He climbed the ledge of the first class deck, 16th level, called ""yacht club"", and fell to the 8th level deck, landing on his back. He did not survive.

Within seconds, a great deal of crew responded. The crew placed a tent over the individual in order to shield them from view of onlookers. Passengers were also instructed to return to their cabin, and close the balcony doors and blinds. After a short time, the majority of the attending crew left the body and placed it under guard until the morning. The medical examiner arrived around 10:00 a.m. once at the port of Miami. The ship was instructed to leave the body undisturbed until the medical examiner arrived.

At last report, the Miami Police were said to be investigating the event as a suicide and reports from alleged family members and acquaintances have confirmed the same.

I only offer my deepest condolence to the family, And hope that I have remained sensitive while also trying to inform the community, mostly those who are on the ship at the time.

Cruise,"Hi there,

So I'm 15 years old and about to go on my third cruise, which will be with MSC for the first time. This is the first time which we're cruising on any line other than Royal. On the two cruises which I have been on with Royal so far, thanks to the teen club I enjoyed my holidays much more than I would've without it, and made some friends who I still keep in contact with today. Anyway, on Royal's website, before I went on my first cruise, I read that the teen club was split into ages 12-14 and 15-17, and I was worried about meeting people younger than me, as I was afraid that I basically wouldn't get along with people younger than me. Despite this, when I turned up, it wasn't split up at all, and all my worries were for nothing. Now I'm worried about the opposite happening. I'm worried that the teen club on MSC is split up (12-14 &amp; 15-17), and I'm worried that I won't be able to get along with people who are older than me, and that there won't be many or any other people my age. This is as on my most recent cruise (Wonder OTS), I was lucky enough to make some friends, who were my age, but since then, I've turned 15. This worries me because the friend group of older kids which seemed to have been made just seemed like they were jerks, and I'm worried that because the teen club on MSC is split up, and I'll be put into the older group, the people who are there will also be jerks, and I'll basically end up having no friends, which I don't want. Also, me and my cousins are thinking about going on their first cruise next year, and despite the fact that we're in the same year for school, they would be 14 and I would be 15 at the time, and we're worried about being split up. 

So if anyone here has been to the teen club onboard any MSC ship, was it separated between ages, is it very different to Royal (do they have daily activities and an icebreaker session and stuff), and were there many people there who were the same age as you?

1. Hit: The seasonal decor! Halls were decked out nice and jolly on the Liberty, with cute touches like garlands everywhere you looked and a giant Christmas tree in the main atrium, complete with a mailbox to leave letters to Santa. It was beginning to look a lot like Christmas for sure.  


2. Miss: Festive Foods. Basically, there weren't any. I have heard of MDR menus offering special meals on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day sailings, so maybe we just weren't close enough to the actual holidays -- but there was nothing at all being offered on ours. MDR menu was business as usual. No big deal, but it would've been nice to see a holiday-specific entree or two, or maybe a dessert.  


3. Miss: Holiday Drinks. So, like the food, there basically weren't any. At least not that I could see, even though I did NOT try every single bar (so someone please correct me if I missed them). To me, this is a huge missed opportunity. I was on a Carnival Halloween sailing last year offering beverages like Patch's Punch and the Monster Mash - so it seems like it would be pretty easy to extend this into the Winter holiday season. I mean... Dr. Seus's Green Eggnog? Cranberry Island Spritzers? Hot Buttered Caribbean Rum... the drink menus write themselves, Carnival.¬†  


4. Big Hit: The Holiday Show.¬† I wasn't expecting very much from this, and in fact, hadn't even known it would be offered at all.¬† Much to my wondering eyes, though, Carnival put on a great little holiday show featuring the truly AWESOME Adam, our cruise director, and many of the kids from Club Ocean actually IN the show and performing!¬† I couldn't help but think how cool an experience that must've been for them. Someone special makes an appearance -- I'll give you a hint, he's big and green, and his heart grows three sizes when he gets on a boat.¬† Yes, it was meeeeee! I kid...  


5. Hit: The other passengers!¬† They were festive AF, y'all.¬† I saw many doors decorated and many people dressed in Christmas-y outfits.¬† Santa hats and sparkles galore, these were some jolly little cruise elves.¬† It really did feel like something special was afoot.¬†¬†  


6. Hit: The music!¬† While it wasn't constant, and that's probably a good thing, there was a nice selection of holiday music being played throughout the ship.¬† You had your typical versions of Christmas songs, plus some rock-ish stuff playing all over the place, even on pool decks.¬† ¬†¬†  


7. Miss: Representation, or lack thereof.¬† Ok, to be fair, there WAS a giant menorah in the atrium, so that's something.¬† But, other than that, Christmas was pretty much the only winter holiday you're going to see represented at all on the Carnival Liberty.¬†¬†

Cruise,"Hello!  I'm booking an Alaskan cruise as a present for my parents (58/60) + sister (13) next summer and want to get some feedback from the experts.

Background: my and my family's only past experience cruising has been going to the Bahamas on Carnival more than ten years back. It was fun and all but for this trip I'm hoping for a more subdued experience focusing on experiencing the destination and scenary and avoid the rowdiness esp with my sister at an impressionable age. My parents have wanted to go to Alaska for a while and this would be my big treat for their bucket list. 

What I found: HAL Volendam round trip from Vancouver, BC first week of June with destinations in Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Icy Strait, and Glacier Bay.

From researching it seems like people all highly recommend glacier bay and getting a balcony room. I'm looking at the Vista Suite with a Balcony for around $4K for all three including fees. I do like that it seems a good amount bigger than standard rooms at almost 300ft.

Overall does this seem like a decently priced booking?

Add-ons: I have the option for paying $800ish more for the ""have it all"" package that includes besides the normal stuff I think $200 OBC. 

My parents aren't big drinkers - maybe a beer/glass of wine at dinner and some fancy coffee here and there. My sister will probably love the mocktails. They wouldn't care much about specialty dining. Only thing they probably care about is the wifi probably.

So all in all the ""have it all"" is $400 after accounting for the $200 OBC + 2x $100/person excursion credit. The difference is $400 but I don't see the math working out. Anything I'm not considering here?

Excursions:

I'm thinking the following:

Juneau: combo whale watching / glacier boat tour

Skagway: Scenic railroad tour to Yukon + stops (looks to be a full 8hr day)

Icy strait: this is listed as a 1/2 hour service stop? Would they actually get to get off the boat? I figure they can walk around and explore nearby area on port.

Ketchikan: Lumberjack show maybe (or should they just do this in Vancouver area?) + Tram up the mountain and some easy hiking trail.

Would love to hear feedbacks and thoughts on the general plan, thanks!",Evaluare this HAL Alaskan Cruise Booking,,xombie-love,,0,2022-12-17 23:01:30

Cruise,"I will embark on a 14 day MSC cruise from Guadeloupe on Sunday. At the time of booking, the best category available was the fantastica experience. So we booked this and bid on upgrade for an Aurea and yacht club room. 

We had already lost hope that our bid would get accepted, until I got charged 2630 USD on my card yesterday. I compared the amount with the upgrades I bid on and it must be a balcony cabin with a hot tub. The only issue now is that I didn't receive a mail nor does MSC know what happened.

When I first saw the charge from MSC, but no mail I assumed it would just take some time to process the upgrade (remember this is 72 hours before the cruise). So I waited until today (48 hours before the start of the cruise) until I called MSC. Here the fun begins.


1. Call ended by the line getting disconnected after I told the customer respresentative that I bid on and upgrade. Technical error? - call duration 5 minutes

2. Call ended with the customer support asking me to reply to the original mail from bid upgrade. Did that and the mail came back with user not found - call duration 15 minutes

3. Call customer representative understands me and says she will give me the correct phone number (which I think does not exist). I call that number and they tell me they do not deal with end users at all and that I have to call the hotline. - call duration 20 minutes (and some 20+ with the wrong phone number I was given)

4. Call... This time I will not give up. The poor guy on the other side talks to his (useless?) Supervisor for about 45 minutes back and forth, but they still can't figure out what is going on. He asks me to send mails again (did that same result, user not found), call my credit card company (not sure how amex will help me, but ok) and finally gave up and said I just have to hope that I get the upgrade or my money back. - call duration 65 minutes


So as of now, MSC has charged me for an upgrade I didn't get, but they also have no idea why or where the money went. Sounds like they have a lot of operational issues!

3. Interior on Celebrity Reflection to Bahamas 

Need to decide fast while offers are valid so can anyone provide insight on the following questions: 

1. What‚Äôs it like having a Havana Cabanas and did you think it was worth the extra cost? 

2. What is the vibe of Celebrity cruises like compared to Carnival? What activities does Celebrity have compared to Carnival? 

3. Has anyone tried the Cloud 9 Spa at Carnival and do you think it is worth the up charge to get a Spa cabin particularly in cold climate itineraries? 

4. f I choose Carnival Venezia, what is there to do or see without doing excursions? Excursions for that cruise are more expensive so I want to know if it‚Äôs feasible to do all self excursions for that itinerary. 

Some things to consider:

-I did do the Panorama already and have considered doing that cruise again but with a Havana Cabana. Or I can hold off on that and do it for my 30th birthday because of the hefty premium. On the other hand I also live an hour away from Long Beach so it costs the cost of flights and hotels before the trip. 

-I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and am the extroverted type which is why I enjoy Carnival and it‚Äôs games and activities but have heard that Celebrity is for a older crowd and may not have an upbeat atmosphere. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit immature for Celebrity cruises but I could step out of my Carnival comfort zone‚Ä¶.",Picking another future cruise,,Life-Satisfaction644,,0,2022-12-15 06:04:49

On Disney‚Äôs oldest Cruise ship, the Disney Magic, how do things stack up in 2022? We got the opportunity to go on the Disney Magic out of Galveston for their 7 Day Very Merrytime Cruise. With this being my 2nd Disney cruise, and our 21st since Cruising restarted in 2021, we have had a lot of great experiences on all kinds of ships, including Disney's newest ship the Disney Wish, part of their Triton Class of new ships, Carnival's Mardi Gras, RCC'S Wonder of the Seas and both of Virgin Voyages ships.

Food- If you haven‚Äôt been on a Disney Cruise yet, then expect some of the best food you will ever have. Unlike most cruise lines there is no main dining room, each night you rotate between 3 different restaurants. Lumiere‚Äôs, Animators Palate and Rapunzel‚Äôs Royal hall, with an early and late seating available, one at 6:15 and one at 8:15. On a 7 day cruise that means you will eat at each place twice, and once in the middle of the cruise you will go to your first restaurant for pirate night and a pirate themed menu that is the same across all 3 restaurants. Every other day will have a completely different menu with no repeats. The buffet is available for breakfast and lunch and not available for dinner, unlike most cruise lines, however there are other things available on the Lido(top deck), the times for the buffet and restaurants during the day will vary slightly, but usually breakfast is around 8 and lunch around Noon. There are several quick eat types of places available when the buffet is closed, there‚Äôs pizza, soft serve ice cream, chicken strips, a sandwich and soup/salad place as well as shawarma and burgers at Donald‚Äôs Duck-in. All of which we found ourselves eating at least once a day at those quick eats places because we missed breakfast or lunch at the buffet/restaurants. There is also free room service available 24 hours a day by calling on the phone in your stateroom which we did order on a couple of occasions. Breakfast and Lunch hours in the buffet, Cabanas, usually runs 2 hours a day for each meal, for lunch you also have food at Rapunzels table and breakfast at Lumieres. On the final day of the cruise you have the option of having breakfast at your last dining room, which is also your first on a 7 day cruise. I found all of the food to be top notch, although there were some items I didn‚Äôt particularly love in the dining room, and a few items in the buffet I didn‚Äôt care for. At the quick eats places on the Lido deck I pretty much enjoyed everything including the burger of the day except for the pizza which was probably some of the lowest quality I have experienced on a cruise ship, the crust was more like pre-made cafeteria pizza, where every other cruise I have been on made the dough from scratch. We did share our dining table with two other new friends, and they did have a dietary restriction, which they pre-ordered all of their meals the day before, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so each of their meals were prepared specifically for them each day.

Shows- There are 3 different Broadway style shows on this 7 day cruise, there‚Äôs a retelling of Cinderella‚Äôs story, with a twist. There‚Äôs also A Rapunzel show and a Disney original that recaps a bunch of different Disney stories called Disney Dreams. They were all really great shows, Twice charmed was great for its original spin. Disney Dreams is full of nostalgia from some of their greatest hits of the 90s and 2000s, Like Aladdin, Lion King and Frozen. Rapunzel was the least original, being mostly a carbon copy of Disney‚Äôs Tangled, but still interesting how they tackle the live action horse Maximus. All together they are shows worth checking out, whether you are kids, have kids, or just Disney Adults enjoying a cruise, I would recommend everyone check out these shows, and if you don‚Äôt like them just come back later and tell me all about it. On top of the shows they do have live entertainment on 3 of the other nights. Our entertainers were a ventriloquist, Lynn Trefzger, a comedic percussionists duo, Bucket‚Äôs and Boards and a magician Jon Armstrong. Each one had a unique family oriented show that runs twice a night, opposite of the dinner schedules. So if you have the early dinner seating at 6:15, your show was at 8:15, and if you had the late dinner schedule, your show was at 6:15. There is also an adults only show every other night by each one of the performers, and they were worth showing up for each time. One night they did have a showing of Strange Worlds, a new Disney movie still out at the theater. At first I was recluctant to go to the ventriloquist show, Lynn Trefzger, but she was hilarious and delightful. The comedic percussion group Buckets and Boards was also a great duo, both funny and good musicians, they will entertain you during the entire run of their family and adult only shows. The magician was an equally good show, featuring the tiny plunger that defied all logic and I have yet to figure out how exactly the plunger knows which card is which. We didn‚Äôt manage to see his adult only show, but I‚Äôm confident it was just as good as the rest of the entertainers.

Entertainment- There is so much to do on a Disney cruise, if you have kids, no kids, or are kids, there is stuff to do pretty much round the clock besides the main shows that run twice a night, there is also a bunch of other types of entertainment. There is adult only entertainment happening in the club, Fathoms, each night, so don‚Äôt think that if you aren‚Äôt a kid or you don‚Äôt have kids you won‚Äôt have a good time. There is a dedicated theater running free movies, most of which are still out in the theaters themselves, running almost all the time. There are occasional free movies out on the open deck as well, usually family oriented showings. Being the Merrytime Cruise, there was also a bunch of holiday themed fun, including Santa and Mrs‚Äô Claus meet and great / photo opportunities. One of the things we have gotten on our Disney Cruises is the unlimited picture package, which is well worth it if you plan on buying any of their pictures. Along with the meet and greats, there are also nightly backdrops that change out each night and run during the evenings with their professional photographers. Shout out to Tommy, my favorite photographer who I just had to say ‚ÄúHi Tommy‚Äù every time I saw him, and without missing a beat he replied ‚ÄúHi Tommy‚Äù back. We took over 200 photos during the 7 day cruise, and about 139 on our 3 day Disney Wish cruise, which goes to show how much more in photo opportunities they have on the Wish vs their oldest ship, the Magic. That would be one of my complaints, after having been on the Wish, which is huge by comparison and has the benefit of Disney learning from every other ship they have built, is that there were far less photo opportunities on the older Disney Magic. There are kids clubs running all throughout the cruise, with lots and lots of activities to keep those kids busy. There were also some impromptu meet and greats throughout the cruise, with Disney Princesses and Marvel heros roaming the halls giving you opportunities to meet them outside of the designated times on the apps. We ran into Spider-Man, Thor, Captain America and Captain Marvel roaming the halls, as well as Donald, Chip and Dale, Cinderella, Belle and Daisy randomly roaming the halls of the main 3 lower decks. Each one of those meet and great is an experience itself, not just a quick photo but an interaction with the actual character themselves. Spider-man was always a delight to talk to, as if talking to Peter Parker himself. There‚Äôs plenty of adult oriented audience participation shows as well, including the risqu√© Quest scavenger hunt, which included presenting things such as a tattoo in a hidden location, and a man wearing lipstick, be sure to bring cloths and shoes that easily come on and off. Even if you don‚Äôt see the main shows every night, there‚Äôs usually quality musicians playing throughout the ship, Karoke in the main lounge and still lots and lots to do for kids.

Layout- You can tell that Disney has learned a lot since they built the oldest ship in her fleet. The Disney magic is much smaller than the Disney Wish, and the layout is like most cruise ships. With an atrium in the middle of the ship, and a few top decks that contain the rest of the entertainment elements, there‚Äôs still a lot to do on this 24 year old ship. You can tell that they learned to make the Atrium a much bigger area on the Disney Wish, one of my few complaints is that the Atrium is tightly packed during two of the busiest nights, Pirate and Formal night, and with it being the Merrytime cruise, it was usually packed for the holiday themed events as well. Speaking with other passengers, I am certain that it‚Äôs an issue with the Magic and Wonder that was fixed with the later cruise ships.

Service- One of the highlights of any cruise will be the amazing crew, and disneys crew is particularly amazing. We had several members of the crew, and cast members, who provided not just exceptional service but sometimes truly magical experiences. Including our wait staff in the dining room, particularly our server Keeley, who was a delight the entire cruise, despite running around busy all the time, she gave us some tips and insights that only the crew can offer you, like standing on the starboard side of the ship for the pirate night fireworks. Our cabin host, Geo, was also amazing, giving us a different towel animal each night, which Chrisy lives for, including a towel birthday cake for Chrisys birthday. There was also Tommy the Photographer, who I mentioned earlier, who even found some of our missing photos and moved them to our account so we didn‚Äôt miss them.

Room- On average the rooms on a Disney ship are bigger than most cruise ships. There‚Äôs more room to walk, and move around but this is definitely a dated ship, there was a flat screen TV, it is only about 15 inches or so, I think my monitor on my computer is bigger. There are some useful things to use your TV for, like checking your account, or watching information videos, but the system needs an update as it is very slow to navigate. There‚Äôs tons of Disney movies and a handful of shows, as well as a few TV channels, including news and sports, but aside from sleeping, and getting ready you will find yourself so busy you probably won‚Äôt spend enough time in the room to tell the difference. The bed and bedding was amazing, we both slept pretty well on them, both perfectly soft but firm enough for our bad backs. The room does divide into two sleeping areas with a curtain, with the couch being transformable into an additional sleeping space. There are no USB outlets like modern ships, but they do have US and EU based plugs on both sides of the Bed and a few plugs at the desk/vanity area, plenty of room to plug in all of your electronics to charge each day, however the plugs were a bit loose so we found ourselves pulling them out or accidently knocking them off the wall without realizing it. We were able to hear some noise from the hallways and from the room we connected to, but for the most part no unusual noises every awoke or bothered us in our room. There‚Äôs plenty of drawer space, closet space and space under the bed, we found ourselves with more space than we needed and we always pack way more than we will ever need. The room was a bit warm at times, which it wasn‚Äôt a problem at night, but we did wish we could have made it cooler. The ship overall was very warm, another sign that the ship is a bit dated, my wife who freezes every where she goes was frequently warm, which means that I am probably drenched in sweat.

Bathroom- the commode area of our bathroom was tiny, I had to close the door every time I wanted to use the toilet and have enough room to sit down or stay standing. If we didn‚Äôt have a Deluxe verandah, which includes a split bathroom on Disney ships, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have had the issue with the small toilet area. One of the improvements they have made on Wish is having a door instead of a shower curtain, our shower curtain had a mildew smell and I think I got taller during the cruise because my head gradually began to scrape the top of the room every time I took a shower.

Embarking and disembarking- This ship went out of Galveston for the Merrytime cruise, it will be absent next year as it going in to dry dock for an overhaul but we expect it back the following Thanksgiving for Merrytime all over again in 2024 with a facelift. Embarking was easy, we arrived around 12:30 and by that time they were allowing all passengers on board. You load from terminal two in Galveston, we used the convenient express parking provided by the port that is directly next to the terminal and inside the protected port area. After dropping chrisy and our bags off with a porter, I parked, took two minutes to walk to the terminal and we were immediately in queue for security screening and check in. Total process took about 30 minutes and we were on the ship. We had no hangups at security, we brought on two bottles of wine and no soda, but they didn‚Äôt even blink an eye at our two bottles of wine when it went through security. For disembarking, we went to breakfast and waited for them to call our disembarking group, but by the time we finished breakfast, everyone was allowed to disembark, so we then waited in a very long line to disembark, probably about an hour in line on the ship, and then another 10-15 minutes in the terminal to clear customs and leave the terminal. The wait on ship was pretty long, but you can probably either leave earlier or wait longer until the lines die down. Our disembarking on the Disney Wish was the complete opposite. It took very little time to get off the ship and a long long time to clear customs.

Mustering- Disney appears to be back to the older style of mustering, instead of utilizing the more digital way that most ships are doing, where you arrive anytime after embarking, check in to your muster station and they show you in small groups how to put on your life jackets and safety briefing. Instead, you have to gather at your muster stations at the designated time, shipwide, and wait for every single person on the ship to arrive at their muster station before proceeding with the brief.

Conclusion- Overall still a very good cruise, although still an expensive cruise. The price of our cruise was comparable to the price we paid on a 7 day on Carnivals new Mardi Gras, or Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, both of their new flagships on similar itineraries. I always expect to pay more for a Disney cruise, but you will get an amazing experience. I will probably cruise on the Magic again, more than likely after it‚Äôs next overhaul and hopefully some of the issues like the Air Conditioning get addressed. The entertainment, shows, crew, service and food are all still top notch, despite the age of the ship, which has been well kept for being nearly a quarter of a century old.",Disney Magic 7 Day Very Merrytime cruise review out of Galveston,,shamelessgeek,,0,2022-12-14 15:22:35

Cruise," 

I couldn't get french fries at 2am (so go to sleep). They canceled a stop because an engine broke (you're on a floating paradise; I'm sure you can find something to do). The doctors on board potentially saved my husband's life and we had to pay them for their experience and service (you gotta be shitting me).

I can't believe the attitudes some people have. And the worst thing is, they're ruining their own vacations. Instead of enjoying a wonderful experience with a multitude of amazing activities, they get hung up on anything that goes wrong. What a horrible way to go through life. Do some yoga, smoke some weed, read a book on reframing your outlook; whatever it takes to manage your expectations. There are babies in Africa who won't live past 1 year old because they were born with HIV + malaria + tuberculosis and you're crying because your cruise butler brought you the wrong type of candy bar???

Cruise,"Hi fellow cruisers I need help and advice!

My family went on the Sailing from Nov. 27-Dec. 4. We had 2 junior suites and one inside room. The 2 junior suites next to each other both had bedbugs which we have pictures of the molted shells from in the couch. We found this immediately after we were able to go into our cabins, then went right to guest services and waited an hour and a half for someone to speak to. They sent housekeeping to the rooms who told us we were lying and there was nothing in the rooms. We just wanted clean rooms. We weren't trying to get any upgrades or anything. We even told them if they had no free rooms available we wanted to get off the ship. They sent in another specialist into the rooms and we waited 2 more hours and by this time the ship already sailed so there was no way to get off the ship. They finally found us a obstructed jr suite and 2 balconies. They were clean so we agreed to stay in them. The rest of the cruise was fine, but I was hit with a 300.00 port collection fee which noone could tell me what it was for. Also I was double charged for the cococay excursion and the refreshment package from Black Friday Sale. At this point Royal owed me 904.00 . 

 Update Today: Still havent received the rest of my refunds totally $604.00 and now we were told we were lying about the bed bugs and they will do nothing futher for us.",Bed Bugs on Anthem of the Seas - Sailing Nov.27-Dec 4. Help!!,,littlemscarla,,0,2022-12-14 01:29:40

I‚Äôm on the new MS Rotterdam right now. I was on the MS Zaandam back in May/June. I‚Äôm a 4 Star Mariner. Loved the line for years. The service was always great. Food is outstanding. And it‚Äôs such a relaxing vibe compared to the more ‚Äúparty‚Äù ships. 

But my last two cruises have been significantly worse than how I remembered it. I sit in my dining room table for 30 minutes before I get to order, almost every day. My stewards recently don‚Äôt feel like they do anything more than clean the room and disappear. We meet on the first day and basically never see eachother again. I‚Äôve had guest services hang up on me when I call for anything. Multiple things I used to enjoy feel like former shells of themselves, like Tea Time and a lot of the shows and events. Even the specialty restaurants have worse service but it‚Äôs still a huge step up compared to the dining room. I watch as a lot of the crew stand around talking to eachother doing nothing. I speak up, nothing changes. 

Now I still like Holland. I had worse experiences on Carnival and MSC. But I‚Äôve seen better recently. I had an amazing experience on NCL recently. And Disney is always great. But Holland is starting to dry out in quality for me and I really hope something is done about it.

I'm sailing Norwegian Gem in January and this is our first time we're dealing with the option to put a bid in for an upgrade. We're currently in a balcony but are curious about the upgrades. I'm curious that if you put in a bid and it's rejected, do you have a chance to try again and up your price? Or is this just a one time shot and if it's rejected you're SOL? 

Also, if anyone's done Norwegian, I'm curious if the difference between Balcony and Club Balcony is a big deal in regards to bigger room, bigger sofa bed etc where upgrading is worth it?  We have a few kids and I'm a bit nervous at the idea of the whole bunk bed thing. We've never done Norwegian and never been in a balcony room so small where that was an option.

Hi! 

I‚Äôm hoping someone can please give me some tips/advice for a cruise I‚Äôve reserved, because after reading reviews online I‚Äôm a little wary and apprehensive this cruise might not be what I was hoping.

We‚Äôve booked the 12 night Tokyo-Singapore cruise with stops in Shimizu, Osaka, Kagoshima, Manila, Nha Trang, Ho Chi Minh. Some of the reviews say that there are very few, if any guided excursions available for English speakers, with some reviews stating they were basically left to their own devices and struggled with the language barrier (which is my main concern, as I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll get much from the trip without being guided). 

The second query I have is about the ship- Spectrum of the Seas. I have read very mixed reviews about this ship. I‚Äôm not concerned about it being tailored to the Asian market (this would be expected), but many reviews speak about the quality of the food. 

Does anyone have any comments or tips about either of these things? Have any of you been to any of these ports and know which excursions we offered?

Broken down numerically and sorted at the end of my cruise to organize it a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

   


Things no one should be ok with:  
1. No one on the boat can speak English properly or give you directions. When you order food you have to repeat yourself 3x and point to the menu and wait for them to confer with a co worker before they realize what you want.  


Random thoughts of things the ship / staff did wrong:  
1. The room is very spacious but for some reason they gave us a handicapped room and then the sliding door fell off of its track when an eight-year-old pushed it.  
2.  Service staff is overwhelmed, poorly trained or not skilled... you ask for sweet and low three times before they bring you something that's not sweet and low.    
3.   Touch screen interfaces on various systems are failing, glitching, resetting .. it's difficult to do anything with those wall mounted touchscreens.  
4. During the performances volume was too loud and the performers were okay but not impressive; the descriptions of the shows could have been better highlighting the actual music that would be played at the rock suggesting the actual plays that would be shown during the best of.  This is high school quality or barely community theater level at best.  
5.  The Mariviglia was supposed to be one of the largest ships.. yet it moves a lot almost constantly like turbulence in an airplane!  Very noticeable people are almost falling over once in a while and the weather's beautiful there's no reason for it apparently Disney cruises don't do this but the staff on the boat says its normal.  
6. They took us to their private island .. day one everything was closed, I mean EVERYTHING.... Day 2 everything was closed until mid day when a few overpriced stores selling junk opened up, the Bar was open... there was nothing to do on the beach, no slide, no buckets or shovesl - nothing for kids to do, nothing for adults to do.. outside of drink and sit on a chair... All the available excursions were canceled due to some unknown reason.. wind I think?   The restaurants don't open until later in the day; and guess what? The awful garbage food from the ship is what is served at those places... so you can't even buy good food on the island!   Oh and yes there is a general store -- hidden there - for the employees only.. but none of us passengers were allowed into that area to buy anything...    
7. While we were at the island; all the stores on the ship closed. including most restaurants.    
8. There was no entertainment happening on the ship most of the time... then occasionally at 7pm on the dot there would be 4 things to do.. but alas!! Day care didnt re open until 7.. so you can't get to it until 7:15 and now you've missed a good bit of your entertainment!  
9. They had a store with 60 kinds of alcohol for sale, including bottles that cost THOUSANDS OF Dollars... they had 40 kinds of cigarettes available.. but if you wanted FOOD? (you know cause the island is closed.. the ships stuff is closed.. your starving...) Well they have 2 chocolate bars, a couple bags of odd candy and thats it.  Shameful...   
10. Our 'minibar' was locked when we arrived and we had to call and request that it be unlocked.  We found pringles in there we could have paid 5.00 for.. exciting.. what a bargain! thats only about 40 cents per chip as it was a tiny container...  
11. On ship communications is ineffective through the app and communicating with your children is nearly impossible unless you sit at the cabin.  You are supposed to be able to message each other via the app but it did not work... messages appear to send but not receive...  
12.There were no trash cans around ship?  I guess you just leave your garbage randomly anywhere as you walk around and hope someone picks it up.  
13. TV is in the wrong side of the room and doesn't even rotate or move.  
14. The app schedule is hidden from past events on the app; the entertainment was lousy.  
15. Final call to port is not listed on the app!  
16. The cleaners will say hi, everyone who gets tips might be polite but anyone who doesnt get tipped will walk right into you and not apologize as they continue to do their job... you are in their way.. how dare you exist on their ship!  This includes people wearing suits that look like managers.  
17. No one in the ship knew their own jobs; nor did they know anything about the ship, where things were, what was happening, almost everyone outside of the guest relations people were incompetant uneducated people who should be forced to go through a basic training and ship orientation.  
18. There was some type of 'medical emergency' that made them turn around and head back to port... this ruined the cruise for everyone else as now we arrived at the island so late that nothing could be done that day.  Why didn't they call the coast guard and have that passenger life flighted away on a helicopter?  


About the food:  Some of this is personal preference, other things are FDA violations.  


1.  The iced tea has lemon in it and fake sugar.  
2. The tomato soup as no crackers they will give you a giant spoon that won't fit in your mouth and it is really watered down and tastes a little bit like ketchup I'd say 10% ketchup 90% water   
3.You get unsalted butter at the table  
4. All of the delicious looking desserts are sugar-free with fake aspertane or sucralose.   
5. The kids menu is only for babies; literally 6 months and under or 12 months and under!  
6. The pizza crust is burnt on pita bread with no flavor sauce not enough cheese and its just lousy.  
7. The ice cream is delicious; but they took away the Vanilla after day 1 and the child we had would not eat the odd flavors they replaced it with.  They should have all flavors every day!  
8.  The food is poor quality, cooked in a non sterile way, burnt or undercooked and made my girlfriend sick every time she ate it.  I brought crackers and ate them instead so I didnt get sick.   Example; the first round of bacon was not fully cooked The second time I asked them for crispy and it came back completely devoid of moisture and had no flavor at all.  The orange juice cups  had black debris floating in the top, the fish sticks were unedible, the condimints were in a bowl with a ladel for you to scoop out your ketchup or whatever... the burgers were bunt, dried up with unmelted cheese on top as they were cold, the buns were dried up and stale.. I could go on for an hour.  
9. The cups are ridiculously small they should be three times bigger or you just have to ask for three cups  
10. They don't have cream they might offer you low fat milk for your coffee.  
11. They dont have NORMAL whole milk; only FAT free or questionable milk in a giant jug that may or may not be at the proper temperature..   
12. They only have strawberry jelly and it's not good quality and it's only in part and no grape or other flavors  
13. The hash browns on the buffet are not cooked all the way, the liquid egg they poured out of the bottle wasnt cooked all the way through, the bacon is either burnt or not raw, the sausage is dried out and nasty. the chocolate cake is dried out and nasty The grapefruit juices ridiculously salty and there's nothing else on that station The next station has orange juice but it's not really orange juice It's water There's no apple juice anywhere one station has hot milk but no creamer you can find creamer at another station...  
14. They have six different kinds of cereal all of them are sugar-free so they taste absolutely lousy especially when you add fat-free milk that has no flavor from MacArthur dairy... ( they should have whole milk)  
15. They should offer a toaster or a microwave or something for us to cook our own food because their chefs are lousy or maybe they could keep stuff warm the bread is all cold dried out poor flavored bagels have no cream cheese.  
16. Hadi buffet manager was polite when I complained, he feigned interest in my issues and we received chocolate covered strawberries as an apology.. but the next day the food and service was just as bad everywhere we went so nothing changed.","MSC Meraviglia?

Cruise,"It seems like there is a lot of misinformation/confusion in regards to what form of ID is acceptable to travel with so I thought it would be wise to make this post. 

The REAL ID is what will be required to board any domestic flight after May 7, 2025. Once you provide the necessary documentation, you will have a little gold star on the right hand corner of your license. Some states are referring to this as an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù license but it is not. You cannot board a cruise ship with this form of identification without another form (ex. birth certificate).

TLDR: you cannot enter the US by land or sea with a REAL ID but it is acceptable for domestic flights. 

An Enhanced Drivers License (EDL) is a form of identification that is ONLY ISSUED IN FIVE STATES - Michigan, Vermont, New York, Washington, and Minnesota. Once you provide the proper documentation, your license will have the words ‚Äúenhanced drivers license‚Äù or ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù on it as well as an American flag. You can use this on any domestic flights as well as for land and sea crossings to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. A passport is still required to fly internationally. They provide proof of US citizenship and identity and thus are allowed for domestic, closed loop cruising (i.e. you start and end in a U.S. port). 

TLDR: the EDL can be used to fly domestically and for land and sea crossings to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. You still need a passport to fly internationally. 

As always, if you have any questions, it is wise to contact the cruise line or the proper government entity.",REAL ID v EDL,,CrzPart,,0,2022-12-12 15:44:28

Cruise," **-Planning your travel**

There are a few things to consider when planning a trip. The first is deciding where to go. Do some research and decide on a destination. Once you have a destination in mind, start researching what there is to do and see in the area. Once you have a general idea of what you want to do and see, start planning your trip. Figure out how you will get to your destination and what hotels or other accommodations you will need. Make sure to purchase travel insurance in case of an emergency. Once you have everything planned out, it's time to start packing! Make a list of what you will need and pack accordingly. Have a great trip!

**-Finding the best deals on flights**

There are a few things to keep in mind when looking for the best deal on a flight. First, be flexible with your travel dates and times. Sometimes, leaving a day earlier or later can save you a lot of money. Also, consider flying on a less popular day to fly. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday are usually the cheapest days to fly. Finally, compare prices between different airlines and websites. Sometimes, the difference in price can be quite significant.

**-Tips for reducing your travel costs**

**There are many ways to reduce your travel costs. Here are a few tips:**

1. Plan your trip well in advance. Often, the earlier you book, the cheaper the tickets will be.

2. Compare prices between different airlines and travel websites.

3. Fly during off-peak hours.

4. Book a seat in the economy section rather than the business or first class.

5. Consider travelling by bus or train rather than flying.

6. Stay in hostels or budget hotels rather than luxury hotels.

7. Eat at local restaurants rather than in expensive tourist traps.

8. Avoid buying souvenirs.

9. Use public transportation rather than renting a car.

10. Shop around for the best deals on flights, hotels, and car rentals.

**-How to save money on your trip**

Saving money on your trip doesn‚Äôt have to be hard. In fact, there are plenty of ways to do it without making too many sacrifices. Here are a few tips to help you out:

‚Ä¢ Stay in budget accommodation. There are plenty of great options out there that won‚Äôt break the bank.

‚Ä¢ Eat at local restaurants. Not only will you save money, but you‚Äôll also get to experience the local cuisine.

‚Ä¢ Travel during the off-season. Prices are usually much cheaper during the offseason.

‚Ä¢ Avoid tourist traps. There‚Äôs no need to spend more money than you have to.

‚Ä¢ Bring your own snacks and drinks. This can help you save a lot of money, especially if you‚Äôre travelling with kids.

‚Ä¢ Use public transportation.

This is a great way to save money while also getting to see the local sights.

Cruise,"Hey guys,

I booked my cruise through cruises.com about two months ago. We depart next week and when I was checking in I noticed that NCL is looking to collect for the gratuities. 

When we booked our cruise, we really only did it because of this promotion. Anyways, we paid and we got the invoice from cruises.com and it mentions the type of cabin, it mentions free at sea and it even mentions the prepaid gratuities.

However, when I log into NCL they are asking for the gratuities up front.

Does anyone know what‚Äôs going on here?
Will the credit be added once on board, or will I get screwed over paying the extra 250? The last thing I want is for the workers to get screwed. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

My big hangup, though, is I hate summer. I don't like the sun. I don't like the beach. Mostly, it stems from the fact that I have very sensitive skin and burn so easily. My other issue is that I'm very heat intolerant. Summers for me are just miserable and it's my least favorite season. Summer is just sweating, sunburning, rash guards, constant reapplication of sunscreen, wet and sweaty clothes. Yuck.

Yet, cruising always seems like it's beaches, oceans, summer and sand. Are there other options? Not necessarily winter or ice, but maybe more activities indoors away from the sun? Or climates that are under 80 degrees? We love travel and adventure, just not in the hot sun. Some of our favorites have been indoor water parks, overnight Amtrak trips, tours up into the mountains (Pike's Peak was amazing), horseback riding trails, interactive museums, landmarks and architecture, an underground cave river boat tour, cultural lessons and sightseeing, learning and doing-types of experiences.

Have been cruising for almost 13 years, this is the most unbearable, uncomfortable dizzying total bullshit cruise I've ever been on.

They are nickel and diming every single thing in little time and the ship has been rocking non-stop almost every hour at sea. The water is as calm as could be, you can feel the counterweights moving throughout the entire ship and you never get a SINGLE minute of peace if you're even remotely sensitive to motion sickness. Drink package?? Forget it, I don't think I need to explain how it'd be a colossal waste of money to be drinking Veuve Clicquot while trying to hold your lunch down for 18 hours on end. Let alone a fucking light beer that's free. Slipped and fell outside of a bathroom and now get to walk around on a bruised knee painful to walk and didn't even bother to mention to guest services other than the nearest staff to the slippery floor, because I know the outcome will be a load of shit.

The entire trip has been a bi-polar disappointment of back and forth rocking enough to give you a headache and send you back to the cabin to miss out on every single activity on board, only to lay in bed and listen to creaking walls, and everything shaking. The only relaxation you get is in port and when you're already on the island.

Manhattan room was so nauseating from the movement, myself and another couldn't make it through the appetizers, I remember loads of fond, COMFORTABLE memories with family in the Manhattan room over the last decade.

Cagney's was top 5 one of the WORST meals I have ever had in my life, steak was terrible, mashed potatoes disgusting, onion soup tasted like flavorless sink water, sauteed mushrooms tasted like they were boiled and completely tasteless (HOW do you fuck up mushrooms for a $200 bill??????)

I understand inflation and that these are some of the earliest post-pandemic vacations to happen and every cruise line is in full blown survival mode, but the illusion has cracked, lots of people look miserable, passive aggressive attitudes in the elevators from a bunch of ass hats trying to get 1 floor down with their fucking Jack and Cokes. Disgusting. St. Thomas was a complete shit show of a tourist trap (Yes, like most of the destinations on any cruise line), with nothing but handicaps on rascals scooting around and blowing their retirement checks on cheap junk sold by non-native investors.

I could go on for hours, beyond disappointed and will never be going on another cruise as long as I live.

Nothing in this world could have made me feel more like a shitty American slob who's only purpose in life is to fund the rich lifestyles and end up 60 years down the road hobbling around on a culturally appropriated island like a lobotomized sheep looked down upon by everyone with disgust.

Cruise,"Because the subject is so confusing, I see questions about identification and visas posted here pretty frequently. I hope to use this post to clarify some of it.

## THE JIST

All documents used for entry into the United States must meet [Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI)](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative) compliance, in which the traveler must present proof of identity and citizenship. Requirements to travel by air are more strict than doing so by land and sea. It is from this that all US-based cruise lines derive their documentation requirements from.

While it was once true that presenting a state ID and birth certificate was sufficient to gain entry into the US (even just an ID once upon a time), identification requirements have gotten more strict over the years. Closed-loop cruising is one of the few modes of travel remaining where adults can still use them as a form of identification.

**HERE'S THE TL;DR:** If you have enough documentation to go on a cruise, you have enough to get a Passport. Just go get one, for crying out loud. The process is not complicated or expensive, and they are good for 10 years (5 for kids). They solve almost any identification requirement, not just those related to travel. You can even pay extra to expedite delivery if time is short.

If you plan to travel outside of the US, at all ever, [do it](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).

## CLOSED LOOP CRUISING FROM THE UNITED STATES

A ""closed loop"" cruise is one that begins and ends in the same port. To board a cruise from the United States, you will need one of the following documents or (set of documents) with more than 6 months left until expiration, where applicable:

* Passport
* Passport Card
* Trusted Traveler Card (NEXUS, SENTRI or Global Entry)
* Federally recognized Tribal Identification card
* State issued Enhanced ID or Enhanced Drivers License
* Government issued identification and state issued birth certificate. This is ONLY ALLOWED for closed loop cruises.

Note that a ""certificate of live birth"" (with the little footprints) is not a valid birth certificate. If a state issues both ""long form"" and ""short form"" birth certificates, only the ""long form"" complies with identification requirements.

## TRAVELING DOMESTICALLY BY AIR

When traveling within the US by air, the [TSA requires a valid form of identification](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification) that is more strict than the ""government issued"" ID required for traveling by cruise.

To cross the security checkpoint, you will need to provide one of the following, recognized as identification at the Federal level:

* Passport
* Passport Card
* Trusted Traveler Card (NEXUS, SENTRI or Global Entry)
* Federally recognized Tribal Identification card (Canada or US)
* State/Province/Tribal issued Enhanced ID or Enhanced Drivers License (Canada or US)
* State issued ""REAL-ID"" compliant ID or Drivers License (this depends by state, so check yours)
* Canadian provincial ID or Drivers License
* Various naturalization, permanent resident and other documents issued for immigration purposes.

## OPEN LOOP AND INTERNATIONAL CRUISES

All other cruise itineraries require the same identification as any other travel by sea. This includes cruises that begin and end in different US ports, such as one-way Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico itineraries, and repositioning itineraries.

For itineraries that begin and end in another country, treat these cruises like any other form of international travel. If you are flying into a country to start a cruise, you need to meet their arrival requirements. If you are flying back to the US after ending abroad, you need to meet the WHTI air travel requirements.

## THE PASSPORT BOOK IS BULKY AND A PAIN TO DEAL WITH

I agree, and there are many convenient credit-card sized ID alternatives for cruising. I still recommend bringing a Passport, but a secondary WHTI-compliant ID is not only convenient to carry, it serves as a backup in case the Passport gets lost.

* Passport Card. When ordering a Passport, you have the option to tack on a Passport Card for a small fee. This document is not as useful as the Passport itself, but it serves just fine for domestic air travel and reentry by land or sea.
* Enhanced ID / Drivers License. 5 states, 4 provinces and certain native tribes offer Enhanced IDs, which act as a Passport Card combined with a local ID. To obtain one, you must provide the same documentation you would for a Passport, or a Passport itself. If this is an option, I recommend ""upgrading"" when you next renew your license. Hint: the DMV person will love you if you present a Passport when applying rather than a slew of other documents; mine issued a verbal sigh of relief.
* Trusted Traveler Card. The Trusted Traveler Program is targeted for those who travel frequently and are willing to sacrifice some privacy for the convenience of skipping lines. These require a lot of footwork to obtain, and are discussed further below.

## DO I NEED A VISA?

One's eligibility to enter a country depends heavily on citizenship and background. Canada, for example, will not allow those convicted of DUI entry regardless of circumstance. So take everything here with a grain of salt, and do your own research.

**Generally speaking** though, as long as one can legally board the cruise and disembark at the destination, it is highly unlikely a visa is required before entry.

For a traveler in good standing with a valid passport, most countries will automatically grant a visitor visa upon entry. Furthermore, cruising is a special beast when it comes to international travel. Cruise travelers move as one big group, and they generally only stay one or two days in each port, so their arrival and departure is handled as a batch. Such travelers are low-risk and cash rich, which means big business, so there is some leniency to visa requirements where they might otherwise be complicated. Turkey, for example, usually requires any traveler to have a visa issued in advance, but for cruisers they issue a temporary pass upon arrival.

Cruise lines require documentation details prior to boarding, and they forward a passenger manifest to local authorities, so any issue with admission *should* be identified before you board. If a specific port denied a traveler entry while on the cruise, I believe the worst case scenario is that the traveler would have to stay on the ship while in port. But that's just my belief; the best advice is not to be in that position in the first place and know if you are *persona non grata* in Belize.

## WHAT IDENTIFICATION DO I NEED IN PORT?

This is one of those ""in practice"" versus ""in reality"" situations.

You will see a lot of recommendations about taking photocopies of your ID, taking your passport, etc. There really aren't many wrong answers. Rather, it's about risk tolerance of taking documents with you. You are simply more likely to lose critical documents while in port than you are of needing them to get home.

My stance: if you are just hanging in port, bring your ship card and any old photo ID or picture of one. If you are leaving the port, bring the ship card and a WHTI-compliant ID (Passport or other) for the extremely unlikely event of getting left behind.

What you can expect from any port security is to be challenged when you attempt to approach the vessel. The main thing they want to see is a ship card that shows name, cruise line and date of voyage, which keeps out anyone who doesn't have a reason to be there. By itself, this card is usually enough because the ship security will further match you with the picture they have on file as you board. Bringing a Photo ID is also a very good idea, both for if the port guards want to challenge you further and if you plan on using a credit card on shore.

## WHAT IF I LOSE MY ID / KEY CARD?

I've had the unfortunate experience of leaving a wallet at an excursion with insufficient time to retrieve it; straight no ID or ship key when approaching the port. This was a headache, but it's not an unusual scenario. My experience was that when you approach the port guard and explain the situation, they will summon ship security. Ship security will then match the details you provide with the information they have; the photo you took at the start of the cruise goes a long way.

In this scenario, it was a *good* thing my Passport was still in my stateroom safe. The real drag was having to immediately cancel all the credit cards, etc., that I left behind and going about getting a new ID when I returned.

At the end of the day, security is ultimately about confidence, and tourists usually look and act like tourists. You want to get on the ship, and they want a full passenger list before they leave port. Almost every passenger is traveling with someone who can confirm their identity, but even if you are traveling solo mentioning that is a qualifying detail. As long as you can confirm the details they ask for - because you are legit, of course - they are almost certain not to leave you behind.

Try not to let it happen, but if it does don't stress.

## WHAT IF THE SHIP LEAVES ME BEHIND, OR I NEED TO STAY FOR EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES?

When you are getting close to departure time and you hear the loudspeaker calling for certain passengers to report to guest services, the crew is almost certainly looking for someone who hasn't returned. They are hoping the guest somehow slipped past security or their card didn't register, but the most likely scenario is that they are still over at Senior Frog's or stuck in traffic.

Despite the aggressive posturing, cruise ships don't want to leave anyone behind in a foreign port. Quite the opposite - they want you back on the ship with plenty of time to spare. Make no mistake, **THE SHIP WILL LEAVE WITHOUT YOU,** and if they do you are responsible for dealing with that, but they would rather you be on the ship if at all possible. Imagine the paperwork of leaving home with 2000 guests and returning with 1990 and having to tell the authorities it's because those passengers weren't back promptly by 4:00.

That said, leaving a harbor involves a lot more than taking a car out of a parking lot, and all those folks have lives to return to. Eventually the call will be made to get out of harbor rather than be stuck in port all night waiting for stragglers.

If you are on a ship-sanctioned excursion, cruise line policy is that they will not leave port until those guests return, if at all possible. If for some reason the excursion cannot return to the ship, the line takes on the burden of getting you back to it as soon as possible. Not ideal, but at least it's not on you.

That peace of mind is the main reason I book through the line despite the up charge. I've been on one excursion where we were over an hour late, and while the crew and harbormaster were chomping at the bit to hustle us onboard, there was no real danger that they would leave without us because they knew we were on our way and the costs of sending all of ahead was prohibitive.

SO.

If you are shopping in port or drinking bad tequila at Sammy Hagar's bar and things suddenly get quiet, that's a good sign you need to get back to the ship proto.

If you are having difficulty returning to the ship and not with someone associated with the cruise line, there is a number on the back of your ship card to call to let them know what is going on. This is where signing up for that ""international day pass"" for your cell phone comes in handy. Obviously you are in much more jeopardy of truly being left behind, but they will still try to accommodate until the logistics of the voyage outweigh the complications of your absence.

Lastly, in the circumstance where you have to stay ashore due to an emergency, the ship will accommodate that to the best of their ability. Let them know as soon as you can, and get what you need off the ship as soon as possible.

If you do get left behind, the ship will most likely leave your critical items - ID, phones, medicines - with the Port Agent, a representative for the line. In that unfortunate circumstance, this agent will help you take the next step.

## IS THE [TRUSTED TRAVELER PROGRAM](https://ttp.dhs.gov/) RIGHT FOR ME?

Passports and related documents are issued by the State Department. Trusted Traveler is the provenance of the Department of Homeland Security, so while closely tied with documentation from State it is a separate beast altogether. A Passport is required to apply to any of the Trusted Traveler Programs.

With the exception of PreCheck, all Trusted Traveler Programs are ways to enter participating countries through a special, expedited line by having done an extensive background check and submitting bio-metrics. These programs supply an ID card that can be used at special lanes when traveling by vehicle, and serves as a WHTI-compliant document. PreCheck specifically applies to security lines at airports and does not provide a card, but is included as a perk of most of the other programs. All require an interview with Border Patrol agents.

* Global Entry is for expedited entry to the US from any location. This has the most flexible interview locations, including most major airports.
* NEXUS is for expedited entry to the US or Canada from any location. A bit cheaper than Global Entry, but interviews are with both Canadian and US officials and can only be done in locations that host both. This is mostly appropriate for those who travel to Canada frequently, or who frequently use Canadian airports as hubs for air travel. Canadian and Mexican citizens are also eligible.
* SENTRI is for expedited entry to the US or Mexico from any location, and includes special registration for a vehicle. It is more expensive than Global Entry, interviews are with both Mexican and US officials and can only be done in locations that host both. This is mostly appropriate for travelers who frequently drive across the US/Mexico border.

If you are ever considering PreCheck you may as well apply for Global Entry if you are eligible because it is basically the same process. Scheduling an interview in a reasonable time frame is the hardest part, especially after COVID, so the earlier you apply the sooner you can get it done.

Not everyone who applies is granted Trusted Traveler status, and for obvious reasons DHS doesn't list the criteria. I *can* say that my wife, who is from the US territory of Guam and traveled to the Middle East as a small child, was scrutinized far more heavily than I was coming from the continental US and never having gone beyond Canada before I was in my 20s.

There are also understandable privacy concerns regarding the program, as there is a lot of information to submit and the terms allow for cross-agency sharing of your information, including to those friendly folks at the FBI. That said, this isn't really much of a concern for those of us who choose to live on the grid and understand that even without this program, the ubiquitous ""They"" already know enough about us to piece it together.

The primary benefit of PreCheck is skipping the longer lines at the airport and usually means avoiding the backscatter machines that freak me out. On reentry to the US (as well as Canada and Mexico for the appropriate programs), Customs has a special Trusted Traveler lane where you do not have to sign a declaration. In many places you don't even need to interview with an agent - you just get a ticket from a machine that confirms your identity and present it to the guard on the way out. While these programs are of minor benefit at a cruise port, at the airport these things make life a thousand times better.

## CONCLUSION

As I mentioned before, if you don't have a Passport, save yourself the headache and just go get one. If you have the wherewithal, get another WHTI document that fits in your wallet/purse and use it as your primary means of identification while on the cruise itself.

All in all, it was a decent time, but I wasn't in the right headspace: had just lost a very close family member a few weeks earlier and was traveling with someone who had never cruised before (even though we were in separate cabins, I felt I needed to be ""on and ready"" at all times). I was ready to get off the ship on day two, but did my best to make the most of it. 

Now I have an opportunity to take the same ship and itinerary in Feb, but this time go completely solo. Princess solo fairs are priced well compared to other lines, but I think other lines may do a better job catering to the solo traveler. However, there is comfort in getting back on a ship that I'm already familiar with and leaving from the port of LA is super convenient. In fact, I've reserved the cabin directly next door to the one I had in Nov. All that said, there's something keeping me from making final payment (which is due this Tuesday). 

I lean more introverted and enjoy my alone time, which I feel I'm overdue after this past year (there's a lot more to the backstory than what I shared above). I'm not big on activities or excursions, which I feel like is necessary on a solo cruise, along with being more outgoing. 

Anyway, looking to hear from like-minded folks who have done solo on Princess in the past. Was it awkward at times? Did you book specialty dining? Or favorite parts of going alone?","One More ""Should I Go Alone?"" Thread...",,Educational_Joke1754,,0,2022-12-05 14:15:11
Cruise,"Hi! Back in October my boyfriend contacted our travel agent after seeing that the price of the cruise went down. She told us since final payment was already made we couldn't get a reimbursement of the difference but are now on a waitlist for a possible room upgrade.  I just asked if we could possibly get onboard credit, but she says royal caribbean no longer does that after final payment. 

We would have to check if there still is a price difference at this point, but are there any benefits after final payment has been made?

Thank you.",Any benefits after final payment? Royal Caribbean Cruise,,StaB26,,0,2022-12-05 14:02:27

I'm trying to find a solution so when I'm in the room I can share my internet with other things. Also when I am on board the ship and throughout the ship to share my phone with my wife's device.

Cruise,"I‚Äôve always been so loyal to Princess because I‚Äôve always had a great experience with them and built some status. So when a family member suggested a Celebrity cruise down to Mexico, I thought it would be fun to try a different cruise line. Well, it‚Äôs been a cluster F since I slapped my deposit down. First they swapped our scheduled, almost new ship out on us for the much smaller and older Solstice (it‚Äôs about to be dry docked for renos). 

Once we got on board, they tried to tell us we don‚Äôt have the free classic drinks package, basic Wi-Fi and gratuities that were offered with booking.  I had to fight hard to get them restored to my account but they finally did.

The ship is nice but very old, worn out, and small with few amenities. But the most disappointing thing is definitely the food. Everything is beautifully presented but just‚Ä¶very ok. We‚Äôre a party of 6 and everyone agrees that the food quality has gone way downhill (4 of our cruisers have been on Celebrity before). We even overheard a conversation on the elevator by a couple who didn‚Äôt enjoy their dinner (they said sucked).

The gelato, which you have to pay extra for, was downright awful. The salad dressings are bottled and taste strongly of preservatives. Everything tastes like Sysco food with some sprigs of garnishment on the side. Even the burger bar was something like what you‚Äôd get at a high school baseball game. Just very, very basic and nothing at all really tasty or special.

The band is frequently off-key and pretty cringy. Then today (day 2 of the cruise), my benefits have disappeared off our account again. I get the feeling this is going to be a daily battle and my credit card will *still* be charged for the things that were supposed to be included. &lt;sigh&gt;

I know these are first world problems but the only reason I‚Äôm sharing my feedback is to warn others to consider cruising with someone other than Celebrity if you have a choice. 

The one thing that is absolutely tip top is the service. Every employee I‚Äôve met has been so warm, welcoming and exceptional. So that part has been very nice to be fair and balanced.",On Celebrity Solstice now and we‚Äôre not impressed.,,JennieFairplay,,0,2022-12-05 08:20:09

Cruise,"Hello! I‚Äôve been Googling / Browsing cruise line sites but Looking to narrow my search down and tips on where to start with planning a cruise for my family in 2023. 

I‚Äôm more interested in the ship / on board experience than anything but looking for some insight on: cruise line / specific ship, destination, month of travel. 

A little more info: 
-must be a US departure port 
- It would be me (33f), my sister + brother in law (both 30), my mom and her boyfriend (both 65). We are a fun, tight knit family that have similar interests. This would be their first cruise and my second, but first one I‚Äôm actually planning. 
- we love live music, spa treatments, social drinking and sunbathing 

Best Cruise line / ship for: 
- adult only
- amazing food 
- premium drink packages
- variety of high quality entertainment options (live music, comedy shows, interactive games, casino, etc.) 
- large pools and pool deck 
- not over crowded but still lively 
- good mix of chill and fun 
- leisurely upscale- think laid back but classy (if that makes sense lol) 
- good vibes / friendly and fun (but not wild) passengers 

Best destination / time of year for:
- warm / comfortably hot temperatures for laying out by the pool and swimming weather
- sunny skies and calm waters 

That being said any/ all tips on what might be a good fit and/ or general cruise advice for beginners is much appreciated!

I‚Äôm in no way complaining and maybe I‚Äôm asking for too much but I‚Äôm pretty easy going and I had hoped for more out out the trip. the waters were extremely rough (unusually so per crew and guests), lots of kids and elderly ppl on board, food was mediocre at best, weather was warm but too cold / breezy to lay out by the pool, ports were too manufactured and pop-up tourist townish for me and while we still had a great time and I‚Äôm glad I went, I‚Äôm looking for something quite different this time around.

This will not be my first time cruising (have been 5 times previously but it's been several years) but it will be his first cruise and our first cruise as a couple. We are looking go for 7 nights somewhere warm (either Mexico out of LA or any option out of Florida). We've done a lot of research but are finding it somewhat overwhelming to narrow down options. We like good food, and lead a decently actively lifestyle. We also love seeing new places so a more port-intensive route would probably be best and are on the younger side (late twenties). While we enjoy a good cocktail we aren't party-people by any means. We would also like to choose a line that is more environmentally friendly if at all possible (we realize no line is perfect but would like to give our money towards a company that actively and authentically thinking about the environment).  We will also probably be booking for late Feb in early Jan so pretty last minute and are open to being flexible as a result. With all this in mind, I've narrowed down our options to Royal, Virgin, Princess and Celebrity.

As a major in Tourism and Hospitality, I'd imagine it'd be natural to see a drop in quality that'd come with the introduction of dozens of brand new hires in a lot of front-of-the-house positions (Reception, Housekeeping, Accounting etc.), so I wondered if that has been the case or has the drop been seemless from a guest's point of view?",Changes in Quality on NCL?,,Gorilla-Samurai,,0,2022-12-02 22:53:06

This was of course hit and miss, but seemed cheaper if a little sketchy on a few. We had enough leeway and flexibility that had things gone totally sideways somewhere, mised the ship or whatever, we could make our way home.

we have planned out a 7 day royal caribbean cruise to the T which departs may 13th and visits roatan, belize city, cozumel, and cococay. out of curiosity i looked around to see if any other lines had longer cruises in may with destinations we would enjoy and came across a 9 night norwegian trip. it‚Äôs itinerary is great stirrup cay, st thomas, antigua, st maarten, san juan, and puerto plata. we have not cruised with norwegian before and would like any and all opinions regarding which we should choose!

norwegian‚Äôs trip on the getaway would be around $2700. this includes their advertised open bar (i have read that this can be misleading so feel free to share your experiences!) it also includes the advertised BOGO flights and we would get to fly out of our local airport less than 15 min from our house which is a plus. 

the RC trip plus flights, 1 night in a FLL hotel, and transportation to/from the cruise terminal would be around $2100. the only difference is we would be flying out of an airport 1.5 hours from our house for this trip to save on flights. both trips are priced with an interior room (:

a little bit about us that may help when determining which is better!

- we bought drinks a la carte on our RC trip this year but were planning on buying packages this time
- we dont really bother trying to get in the pool on the ship; both enjoy laying out on the upper deck‚Äôs loungers during days at sea
- weren‚Äôt overly impressed or dissapointed with RC‚Äôs food - were just happy to not have to cook or clean for a week and have plenty of options
- ship entertainment does not matter much to us - we did enjoy listening to karaoke a couple of nights but didn‚Äôt attend any shows
- love getting in the hot tub in the evenings
- did not purchase internet on RC and do not want internet access on our trip even if it‚Äôs free lol

some things we loved about royal caribbean: 
- their app was really helpful especially while still finding our way around the ship
- we frequented the frozen yogurt machine at the pool each day haha
- going to the casino after dinner
- complimentary room service breakfast for early days at port
- our bed on mariner of the seas was extremely comfortable
- super friendly staff! 
- pizza, cookies, tea, etc. available 24 hours a day at the promenade
- poolside servers
- we go through a LOT of towels so RC‚Äôs beach towel rental system was convenient

overall, we enjoy the simple things on the ship and make the most of our days at port. all of the videos i‚Äôve watched of the norwegian getaway look great but the forums i‚Äôve read comparing norwegian to RC scare me a little lol. however, i know some people are MUCH harder to please than we are so i try to take those reviews with a grain of salt. 

i would greatly appreciate any and all insight!! thanks in advance (:",experienced cruisers! i need help comparing 2 cruises for may 2023!!,,morgxn427,,0,2022-11-30 03:04:30

Some details‚Ä¶We have paid in full for our 7 night NCL Caribbean cruise (departs Puerto Rico-stops in Aruba, Bonaire, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, and Cura√ßao) with free at sea packages, $150 in onboard credit, all our prepaid gratuities and excursions are paid for. 3 of our 6 ports have excursions booked and we have the ‚ÄúLovers Delight‚Äù package which includes lots of little extras like massages, champagne and snacks in our suite already. We also have a two day deviation to explore Puerto Rico before our the cruise leaves, where we have a air bnb booked. 

We don‚Äôt have typical touristy habits‚Ä¶like you won‚Äôt see us trying to buy t shirts and key chains, or whatever souvenirs I would imagine are readily available. mostly just try to eat and explore locally where we can, and try not to venture out too far from the cruise ports.

Cruise,"I previously posted ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/ywenya/cruising\_with\_invisalign/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/ywenya/cruising_with_invisalign/)) with questions on cruising with Invisalign trays.  I sailed last week, so here's the update on how I fared along with suggestions for future cruisers.

Background info:  My ""week"" starts on Wednesday.  When I sailed (on a Sunday), I was in week 2 (of 21).  Also, I'm not a dentist/orthodontist, so none of this is intended as medical advice.

Overall:

1. I ate far less than I normally do on a cruise.  Mostly because I was too ""lazy"" to want to brush and floss again just to eat one more cookie/ice cream/etc.  
2. I'm supposed to wear my trays for 22+ hours per day.  I probably was only at 19-20 hours per day onboard (45 minutes for breakfast + 60 minutes for lunch + 120 minutes for dinner + time for a snack).  
3. I found the buffet to be easier than the MDR - no need to spend extra time with my trays out while I wait for food.  (Note:  you can ask your MDR server to bring your food all at once, but given that most ships are short-staffed, I wasn't comfortable asking my server to do even more work.)

Tips:

1. For a one-week cruise, bring 4 weeks' of trays:  last week, current week (when you board), next week (to start while on the cruise), and the following week (in case you lose the ""next week"" trays).
2. Bring a colorful case (I went with yellow) so that it stands out.
3. Bring an extra travel toothpaste just in case you run out.
4. Carry a small bag/purse/fannypack with your case, toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss.  I'd also suggest having a toothbrush case (that covers the entire toothbrush) so you can set it down on a sink without it getting extra gross.
5. If you're going ashore in a country where you wouldn't drink the water, make sure to bring/buy a bottle of water to at least rinse your mouth out (if you can't brush/floss).
6. Carry hand sanitizer with you off the ship in case you can't find soap/water to wash your hands.  
7. If you have the chance to talk to your dentist/orthodontist beforehand, he or she might have additional recommendations (wearing a tray for an extra week, etc.).
8. If you're going to try to drink non-water while you have trays in, bring a disposable straw (or two).  Again, I'm not advocating for this.
9. If you feel the need to soak your trays, bring retainer cleaner with you.

What I would do differently next time:

1. I would check where my table is in the main dining room and move closer to the entrance, if possible.  Naturally I was seated in the very back Portside (entrance was Starboard) and ladies' room was Portside outside the restaurant.  To walk in the dining room (with trays in), then order, then get up 10 minutes later to go to the ladies' room to take the trays out, walk back, it legitimately took 10-15 minutes.  Halfway through the cruise I started taking them out at the table (as discreetly as possible) because it was a chore.
2. I would brush/floss in the ladies' room outside the restaurant/buffet/MDR just after I ate.  It didn't really bother me, but right after dinner the sinks would get pretty busy, so there were a few times where I'd have my trays/floss/toothpaste on the sink area (while I stood brushing) and someone would walk up and wash their hands across me.  It might've been just as easy to head back to my room to brush/floss to avoid the cramped sinks post-dinner.  
3. I would have carried hand sanitizer everywhere with me to minimize any hand germs from entering my mouth when I took my trays out.  
4. I would have given myself permission from the start to wear my trays ""only"" 20 hours a day.  The first few days I was fretting about it and it negatively impacted the first couple of days of my vacation.

We are thinking of going on a cruise beginning of January, from florida to the caribean,  towards st-marteen, Puerto Rico etc.  
Never been on those islands and we really like to visit that part. 
We have only been on 4 cruises but nothing that way and always summer times. 
For our dates I find a cruise from the above 2 lines. 
Celebrity is about 6700.00 CAN (celebrity beyond )vs 4700.00 CAN (regal princess)for balcony with full package. (Drinks, tips etc)

We are ages 48 and 49 with my wife traveling with no kids, so parks and rides do not interest us really 
Any advice between the two cruise lines ? 
Price difference is significant. 
Is paying an extra 2k worth it between them ?

And what about weather around those parts in that time of the year ?

Cruise,"Sorry for the long post!

Bit of background: we were excited to take our first cruise with my in-laws in 2020, booked through Costco Travel. Cruise was cancelled, we opted for the future credits, and re-booked for this last August (3 rooms paid mostly with FCCs). 

Well, the worst happened and my SO tested positive for COVID a few days before cruising and the rest of the family was in close contact just the day before. I called Costco and they got on the line with HAL's escalation team. HAL said we should cancel all three rooms ""for the safety of guests and crew"" due to the close contact and they would refund the credits. I was advised an email might come asking for the positive result, and due to staffing the credits could take weeks to a couple months. It seemed pretty straight forward so I didn't question anything.

Fast forward 12 wks+ and I reach out wondering where our credits are. Costco confirms with HAL everything is coded as COVID cancellation and HAL asks me to send the positive test. I do, and the response is that cancellation only applies to the one room, they won't refund the other $6k for the other rooms.

I reply they are the ones that told me to, and it wouldn't make sense for us to cancel without refund since they would have just taken the cruise instead of throwing away $6k. No response.

I get if we did something wrong or misunderstood it's on us, but to have them tell us to cancel and we'd get credit, then say ""ha ha, nevermind"" is just blowing my mind. Outside of asking Costco for call notes and doing a BBB complaint, any ideas on next steps? Would Costco have more sway with them?

Thanks for any advice, outside of ""should have gotten it in writing."" If there would have been any indication of trouble I would have, and of course hindsight....",HAL Cancellation Issues - Help!,,Yad19,,0,2022-11-23 21:26:27

Same applies to the shows; I could buy a couple shows for 12.00 each on my upgrade page; but aren't some included free?  if so when? where? what?  how many?

Cruise,"We are looking to sail in March or April. We've been on one cruise previously, on the Grandeur to Nassau/Bermuda/Coco Cay. We liked the fantastic service we got, but the ship didn't have many options for entertainment. We'd really like to go on something with more ""wow"" factor for our honeymoon.   
Destination: Either Aruba or St Kitts   
About us: Late 20s, casual people. Like both sports bars and fancy steaks, along with arcades, punk music, and broadway.   
     

   
Ideal budget: Under 8k after drink packages and gratuity and whatnot  

 
The three I'm considering right now:  

Option 1:  

*  Celebrity Edge, 11 days. Probably concierge room or infinite veranda.    
* Ports: George Town, Grand Cayman. Cartagena, Colombia. Oranjestad, Aruba (overnight stay). Willemstad, Curacao. Nassau, Bahamas.     

* This looks like a really pretty ship but I'm worried there won't be enough to keep us occupied for such a long cruise. I like all of the ports except for Nassau. I love how it stays overnight in Aruba so I could see the glowy plankton- it seems really rare for a cruise to do that. 
     

Option 2:  

* Wonder of the Sea, 7 days. Ocean view balcony.  
* Ports: Basseterre, St. Kitts. Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas. Coco Cay.   
* This ship looks like an absolute blast and a ton of fun.. It looks like it'd blow our minds after only having been on the Grandeur. But the ports aren't as neat as Option 1, and we've already been to Coco Cay (although we loved it, even though it was still under construction when we went and is probably even better now). We also really liked the service we had on Royal Caribbean, they went above and beyond to accommodate for our allergies. Best price of the three. 

Option 3:

* Norwegian Epic, 7 days. Fancy suite of some sort.   
* Ports:  Oranjestad, Aruba.   Willemstad, Netherland Antilles. Kralendijik, Netherland Antilles. St. Lucia. Basseterre, St. Kitts.  
* Interesting for the ports and luxuries we could get. I like how this ship has both St Kitts and Aruba. We'd be able to be fancy and get a Haven room. But the ship has really meh reviews and seems a bit janky, with not much to do. Would being Haven make it worth it?  I honestly don't know much about Norwegian so I'd like to hear what people think about this.


Currently leaning towards Option 1 but Option 2 looks really cool and is extremely tempting. I would really appreciate hearing any experiences/thoughts on these ships or ports, or if you have any other suggestions for cruises that might suit us.

Since I was about 25, I'm 36 now, I have wanted to go on a cruise. The draw for me is being taken from country to county and different places to explore. That's what I want to do, explore. And I prefer to do it by myself so even the cheapest option is pretty expansive for me.

Finally a few years ago I had the stability and the financial means to book a cruise. That was early 2020 for a sailing date of August that year. Do I need to explain what happened to that cruise?

I can't begin to describe my disappointent of not getting to go. I had longed for this for so long.

A lot of stuff has happened since and yesterday it just hit me that I should try again. 

So... I have a new booking! Sure, it's almost 2 years out but it's there. My second try to go on my very first cruise.

Cruise,"What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts on main dining room vs specialty restaurants vs the virgin style where there isn‚Äôt a main dining room.

One of the things I look forward to most on cruises is sitting down every night, same time, same wait staff.  They get to know you, have your choice of beverage waiting for you, and the really good ones get to know your taste and help you decide on meals.  Because of this I rarely do specialty dining.

The food and service on Virgin was so good that I didn‚Äôt mind not having the same table and waiters but I still prefer the main dining room style.

2. Norwegian Getaway, great stirrup cay and nassau 3/18-&gt;26. Comes to a little under $2400 with free at sea. 

We do plan on drinking but nothing ridiculous. The fine dining will also be enjoyed. If we get unlimited drinks on RC then I believe the price difference will be much closer.

My partner and I booked our very first cruise this December! We‚Äôre leaving NYC and heading to Bermuda for 5 nights on 12/13 on NCL's Getaway.

We booked our stateroom without thinking it through‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre at the very front of the ship on a high deck. Now I‚Äôm reading that if you suffer from motion sickness (which I *really* do) you should try to book a stateroom in the middle of the ship. I‚Äôm ALSO reading that there have been some pretty rough seas out of NYC in the winter. Wasn‚Äôt even aware of that people cruised through that bomb cyclone the other year until after I booked. The thought of cruising out of a NE port in the winter now terrifies me because I‚Äôm not sure if cruise lines really care to steer clear of choppy seas.

As a first-time cruiser, should we cancel our trip (we‚Äôll get a 75% credit for another cruise) and go sometime next Spring or Summer instead when the oceans tend to be calmer? I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúruin‚Äù cruising for us ‚Äì and if we have sea sickness throughout the entire trip I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll ever want to cruise again.

Cruise,"Apologies if this is just me being stupid...

I'm due to go on a cruise next month with MSC Cruises to Northern Europe, and I'm a little confused by the wording of their policy regarding Covid testing before embarkation. I'm fully vaccinated (though that seems to be advised, rather than required), but for the testing it states:

 **For vaccinated Guests it‚Äôs not required (but strongly recommended) to present a negative test.** 

Which means, happy days, I should all be good. But then it goes on to say...

 **Unvaccinated guests, guests without a vaccine certificate, or guests who have recovered from COVID-19, ages 5 and older are required to present a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR or Antigen test taken 48 hours prior to embarkation.** 

The part I'm confused by is ""guests who have recovered from Covid-19""... because while some have got away with it so far (including myself until last week!), most people will have surely recovered from Covid 19 at some point now over the last few years. So surely this means the majority of people are required to present a test?

Obviously I'd rather avoid this PCR test if I can, due to costs/the fact that I've got a fair bit of travel arrangements already to undertake and could do without this added complexity.

I have been unable to speak with my original travel agent as she received a promotion, and now when I call in I get random people of varied experience and helpfulness. So, after about 3 hours of call time, they are telling me that they will not even honor the price at the time of booking because they can't find record of my purchase.

Cruise,"Hello, I have talked to 5 different people, and read the requirements on Royal Caribbean's website and they say simply that I can travel on the cruise I just need a Birth certificate, Drivers License and Green card as I am a US resident.

Well, one of the representatives told me to call my embassy, but they were closed. I emailed them, and they said I could not travel internationally without a passport.

We are going to the Bahamas (Passport not needed) and Cozumel Mexico. Well, I would like to get a passport but my country has a shortage and this cruise is for my friend's birthday, we booked it based on Royal Caribbean's information saying it was okay without a passport.

What is confusing is my homeland embassy saying I need a passport, well I call the royal Caribbean back to tell them that and they say I can go on the boat I may just not be able to get off in Mexico. 

He also said to call the US Embassy (I could not find their number) so I called a number associated with them, they gave me a number to the passport dept, and he said to call them and see if I can re-enter the USA when I leave. I explained I am on a closed-loop cruise too. I explained it the same but they said I would not be able to re-enter and that I need a passport card. 

But the thing is I am not sure if I can get a passport/passport card cause it has to go through my country's embassy. 

So what is the deal? If I go to the port with the documents on their own website and 5 sources via the Royal Caribbean say, could I be turned away, does it depend on the country I am from? ( I explained where I was from just in case this only applied to Canada).  If I am allowed on is it up to Mexico to let me off, I heard by Cruise, I can show them the green card, birth certificate and Drivers license as well. I will call their embassy tomorrow to verify too.

Then I need to know if I can re-enter the US, some lawyer sources say that's only if you have a criminal record that you can't re-enter. I am clean. I have lived in the US for a while too, getting my citizenship in a couple of years. I have a US license. So someone who is able can you please explain (preferably from personal experience)

Cruise,"My wife and I and our two kids just did a transatlantic. Our kids are 1 year and just under 3 years old. Here are some thoughts.

We. Loved. It. 

We were on the Celebrity Edge, new ship, great food, great staff. I've only cruised with Celebrity so can't speak to comparisons. But I loved the Edge. We had two connecting infinite veranda staterooms, highly recommend it for cruiser parents of young kids...

With toddlers cons:

1) dining was tricky at restaurants, pace is slow. We would order their main out with our starters, that worked, but the kids would be losing it by end of our main... So not great for enjoying the meal. We don't do ipads, if you do might be a bob issue.

2) the camp at sea... Must be 3 or older to drop kids there. We would use it as a playroom with us chaperoning which was great, the kids loved it. The staff was so so so great with kids. Can't wait to cruise with the kids when they're over 3 years old... Then it can be a literal camp at sea.

Pros...

Our kids freaking loved it. 9 days at sea, lots of ship movement because it's the ocean. The kids loved being on the boat, slept pretty well, ate well, lots of food, lots to see and explore, loads of live music, the playroom, the stateroom itself... So much to love. I was very surprised how much they loved it.

We brought my wife's parents along. It was amazing. They enjoy cruising and it was nice because they got a ton of time with the kids, which they normally don't get. It was a win for us because they could watch our baby monitor if we went to a late dinner or late sauna. Our VTech baby monitor worked to their stateroom on the same deck. If you can, bring the grandparents. The kids grandparents on the ship with all those sea days meant lots of bonding time, which was so special.

Eating: Lots of variety at the buffet which was good for the kids. We ended up doing a ""children's tea"" dinner for them, then we would eat later as a couple. We also did a couple nights of hiring the camp at sea staff as babysitters (i think it was $30 for two staff up to 3 kids). This was great too as they would feed and put our kids to bed. Highly qualified and our kids LOVED them.

There were only 5 total kids on board the ship, one other 1yo and two teens. This was nice because the kids were a hit with just about anyone who saw them, so they felt like superstars and the centers of attention. This is bad because everyone on the ship will know you... No fading into the background :)

Jet lag was definitely easier. We travel a lot with kids and slowly adjusting an hour a day is far better than losing a week due to jet lag at the next location. Yes, you will be confused about time and wake up early (Europe to FL), but it didn't really matter as there was nothing else we had to do. We travel a lot (14 countries this year with our toddlers) and doing the transatlantic was like a decompression time to R&amp;R. Was great and I prefer it to flying with toddlers... If you have the time! 

I personally loved the sea days. If you don't like them on normal cruises, a transatlantic will be boring. I wasn't bored once and barely read my books. The kids always were doing something, an activity, walking around, eating, playing, napping. Was great for relaxation even with two toddlers.

People joke about the infinite veranda rooms, yes the bar at eye level is funny, but it was so great to have a big stateroom space and huge ocean views. Kids loved the space.

Our almost three year old slept in the bed and our 1yo slept in the crib Celebrity provided. It was a small pack &amp; play (not a standard one), but it worked.l fine.

We bought the spa pass (thermal suite), it was so great to relax there while the kids were with the grandparents. If you're into saunas and steam rooms this was fantastic. They have heated chaise lounges looking over the bow of the ship. Truly great space day or night.
 
Just wanted to write and share as we arrived in Port Everglades before the hurricane almost a week ago, and are still thinking about it.

We got a ridiculous rate on the staterooms, we bid on the upgrade and got it, the ship was 55% full, we were one of the few families on board, and had the grandparents with us... All of this made it special... However I would definitely consider a crossing in the future even if the ship was fuller, price was higher, and more kids were on board. Maybe not without the grandparents!! :)

If you're a grandparent, get your kids and their families to go. If you have kids, do it with your cruising parents. Just wanted to share!",Transatlantic with Toddlers,,cuycuy,,0,2022-11-14 01:16:25

Will he be able to get on the cruise ship at all? If he‚Äôs able to board ship, will he be able to get off at ports?

Cruise,"Our first cruise :-) Need help with picking the right one for us. We will be flying in from Toronto to one of the ports in Florida and taking a Royal Caribbean for 7/8 days- that's how much we have figured so far. Here are the options i have.

1.  **7 nights**\- Dec 10 - Western Caribbean - **Symphony of the Seas** \- Miami, Costa Maya, Roatan, Cozumel, perfect day, Miami - I can pick a balcony room myself - **$2560 with 120 OBC**
2. Same as above on Dec 17 - - $**3300 with $200 OBC**
3. **8 nights -** FLL - Dec 10  -**Harmony of the seas** \- FLL, Oranjestad, Willemstad, Labatee, FLL - No perfect day but most affordable - **$2375** 
4. **7 Nights -** Recommended by the agent -Dec 11 - 7 days from Port Canaveral,  **Wonder of the seas**\- Perfect day (at the start of the trip), Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, PHILIPSBURG, PORT CANAVERAL - Agent said its better to get ""perfect day"" at the beginning and then relax, and these ports are better spots? - **$3100 - $200 OBC**

My priorities - being the first cruise - want the best cruising experience better ship from kids' activities pov; we like excursions, but its not a priority; we like clean beaches and a kid-friendly environment. My flights to FLL are slightly cheaper than MIA. Orlando- we could spend another day at the kennedy space center, if we go with that option- not planning to do any theme parks.  
 Questions:

1. Is it better to do perfect day at the beginning / Is perfect day a must do for kids (9&amp;4)?
2. Which is a better itinerary for us(kid friendly) ?
3. What is the best option here overall for my situation?

* due to the late departure (by probably 8 hours) they cancelled our next port of call, which was one of only 3 ports I have not been to.
* they have also switched another port at the end of the ceuise, but the has been zero communication about this. Its yet another switch to a place I have been to from one I never visited. It seems the reason is also to return half a day early to Hamburg, because the ship is due to take part in a performance for the Hamburg cruise festival. 

I'd like to try and see the places I now miss sometime in future and and if it's realistic I'd like to get some form of compensation as I was not planning to return back to Norway after this trip. All MSC have communicated is that we can get the missed excursion refunded. 


For context, there are other minor issues:

* we have an all you can use package to use the thermal spa at all times and were not advised we need to make a reservation until we wanted to use it. The first available reservation slot was for a date 7 days later for a maximum of 1 hour. Despite having sold and the limited availability they still sell slots and we cannot make more than one booking.

Cruise,"I'm planning (so far just in my mind) for a Caribbean cruise in May or June of 2023. I had in my mind to take one with multiple ports (possibly on the MSC Seaside). But then I came across a thread about a Bermuda cruise. A single port never occurred to me, so now I'm stumped. I've never been to the Caribbean before and I'm not sure if it's better to see more places on a single cruise - one day each - or spend two or three days in a single place. And I  don't know if I'd ever go to the Caribbean again. So maybe it's better to see more islands than less, if I might not be back to the Caribbean? (I've been on one cruise before; the Hawaiian islands on NCL about 9 years ago. I liked it, but looking back at it now, within the context of multiple ports vs. a single port, it **was** kind of repetitive. But it was almost a year ago, so my memory might be blurring the islands together.)

So my questions are:

1. Are the Caribbean islands different enough that you'd really need to go to different ones in a single itinerary to get different ""experiences"" or see different things? St. Thomas isn't the same as Tortola (for example)?
2. If you've taken a cruise to Bermuda AND taken a multiple-port Caribbean cruise, was one better than the other?  Why? (I'm sure that answer will be - ""They were just different."" :) )

The whole thing was fantastic, but I noticed that whenever I would turn down an appetizer or dessert or danish in the morning at breakfast, the waiters/waitresses would always act shocked like I had done the unthinkable. This happened at 3 different specialty restaurants and the main dining room. Even when my wife and I wanted to share dessert or an appetizer instead of getting 2 individual ones it happened. I would get that they might be kind of offended if it was some kind of ethnic personal thing where their mother makes the food, but this is a big company.

I am finally going on my first cruise with my fianc√© this September with NCL, Norwegian escape, around Italy and the Greek Isles. 

We have lots booked already but one place I have not planned for is Santorini. It is one of the main places I wanted to visit but because we booked the cruise so late, most excursions to Oia were sold out.. 

I need some advice!

We are docked from 1pm until 10pm at the tenderport in Fira. I hear the cable car waits can take up to an hour and walking takes about the same amount of time (but is smelliest from the donkey poop). 
Which method would you recommend?

We were considering doing the hike either to Oia or from Oia back to Fira and booking a taxi/private transfer from Fira to Oia.. 
What time should we be booking the car for? Would 2:30 be safe? Or should we book even later in case of delays? Or are the busses easy to navigate?

I checked and it looks like there are two other ships docked with us, they arrive at different times (one much earlier at 8am, the other at 4pm)

Any advice would be so helpful!

We just want to see the beauty of the place, eat some food and enjoy it with as little stress as possible. It's also our first stop on the cruise so it's been really hyped in my head!

Cruise,"I‚Äôll just share a quick list of pros and cons as I‚Äôm quite tired after waking up so early today for the disembarkation. This was my second cruise ever, I was on RC‚Äôs SoS in Dec.
Pros:
* Gorgeus new ship, I actually really like Kelly Hoppen‚Äôs design, it‚Äôs really chic and very boutique hotelish. Loved all the art around the ship, so many beautiful pieces!
* Only 50% capacity, so no queues anywhere really. Apparently the next cruise is fully booked.
* The crew was wonderful and very approachable 
* Our bid was accepted so we had Sky Suite which we loved (real balcony with a lounger and huge bathroom)
* Entertainment was of high quality with various options, all the performers were really good 
* Generally loved the food, we mostly ate at the Luminae (suite exclusive restaurant)
* Housekeeping staff was awesome, the lady provided anything we asked in a hot minute! 
* Loved the Retreat Lounge, exceptional service

Cons:
* Too many kids! It was excepted due to the holiday season but still kinda ruined our suite experience. The Retreat pool was constantly occupied by kids jumping in and screaming. If Celebrity wants to attract families, they really need to consider adding a pool for kids! Same issue with  The Luminae, screaming kids around. 
* Service was sometimes very slow and a bit confused, could be due to staff shortages. This problem was surprisingly most visible at The Luminae. 
* There was only one actual show at the theatre, other nights were filled with solo acts. Eden shows were great and they were happening almost every night.
* Eden is beautiful but they need more chairs for the shows, plus you can‚Äôt really see the stage from half of the venue. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt manage to try out the restaurant as it was sold out.
* Butler was a bit useless, the lady we had was very friendly but we rarely saw her around. She told me that her contract ended after our cruise so perhaps she was just not into it anymore. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* In the last days kinda got sick  some of the snooty and snobby fellow passengers. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there were some great people on board but overall I felt the vibe was not relaxed.
* Chair hogging was quite bad over at the suite area but funnily enough not in anywhere else

Cruise,"Wife and I are taking a cruise out of Ft. Lauderdale. It's all booked, paid for and whatnot. 

Right after booking the cruise I started looking for flights. Since we're well north of 25 years old we look for non-stop flights first then flights with reasonable layovers second. This time around we found flights with 2 hour layovers in Atlanta. We figured even one of the flights is a little late we should be fine. We're both in reasonable shape for our age but definitely won't be running the Boston Marathon anytime.

So I just found out Delta moved us to a different flight from Atlanta to Ft. Lauderdale. Now we have a 30 minute layover in Atlanta; not the 2 hour one we booked. Knowing Atlanta is pretty big this has us very nervous.

The Delta agent on their chat interface said everything will be fine. However my spidey sense is tingling; and not in a good way.

Have any of you dealt with a situation like this? Is Delta known for holding a plane for passengers on connecting flights? Delta does have one flight later from Atlanta to Ft. Lauderdale but their website is showing that flight is sold out. Otherwise we'd be looking at a 7:20 flight the next morning (which would land in FLL at 9:09) so that may be an option but would really be pushing the envelop on getting to our boat on time.

**Edit to add: Thank you everybody!** Since we booked main cabin but not the refundable main cabin *I thought we were stuck*. However, Delta allowed me to change flights due to a significant change in flights. We're now leaving Seattle at 9:40a.m., arrive in Atlanta at 5:00p.m. Leave Atlanta at 8:00p.m. and arrive in FLL at 10:00p.m. I'm betting we'll be at our hotel around 11:00p.m. which will give us a good night rest before the cruise. A 3 hour layover suits us just fine. We don't have our gate assignments yet but today it looks like SEA-ATL is coming into A2. ATL-FLL is leaving A24.

1. They canceled our trip to Stirrup Cay. This was the main reason why we wanted to cruise with NCL,  the captain claims that due to ‚Äúwaves‚Äù and weather we couldn‚Äôt go. Not buying it and other guest that have been before said that the day wasn‚Äôt any different than other days. 

2. Food. I was told that the free food options was way better than Carnival. I vehemently disagree. The options to pay for food was better than Carnival 

3. AirConditioner. Their dining area was always warm. It was like the ac was going in and out all day. Also the Casino was hot a balmy. Sitting down at the roulette table,we asked why was it so hot? The pit boss said that it was central air and they can‚Äôt adjust the air. So we‚Äôre sitting there in a low ventilated hot-area.

4. Drink packages. I was going to purchase the package for Starbucks and we were told that i was going to be charged for two since there was two people in the cabin. My wife doesn‚Äôt drink Starbucks, so I only needed one package. So I went down to guest services and they confirmed that I had to pay $80 for the package.

I‚Äôm a total worrier and the biggest concern I have is getting the COVID test taken and getting results.

Cruise,"Just got back from a 7-day Princess cruise to Alaska. I was traveling solo and ended up spending a LOT of time in the casino. I was curious going in what kind of comps I‚Äôd get, so I thought I‚Äôd post about my experience in case others are curious. 

As a rough estimate, I spent 3-4 hours in the casino on port days and 8-10 hours there on sea days. I‚Äôm embarrassed to say all the dealers knew me by name at the end. I mainly played table games (blackjack, ultimate hold ‚Äòem, poker). Was usually buying in for about $200/day. Ended up with a small profit of $200 for the cruise, but probably just as easily could‚Äôve lost my rough bankroll of $1000 or so. 

I introduced myself to the host on the first day, and he said they‚Äôd reach out if I was there often. 

The first sea day, he approached me mid-afternoon offering a drink. I had the drinks package already so didn‚Äôt need that. He came up to me an hour later offering a free specialty meal, which I gladly accepted! 

The fourth day, he came up and handed me a mug with with a photo I had taken on the boat earlier in the trip. I saw him hand a few of these out to the regulars. 

The fifth day, I had chocolate covered strawberries delivered to my room. Later that day, I was offered another specialty meal. Disclaimer on this one: they had offered me dinner for two the first time but I‚Äôm traveling solo so I‚Äôm not sure if the second comp dinner was just cuz was alone the first time. 

Finally, the morning of the last sea day I received a promo offer for a free cruise with a balcony up to 12 days including princess plus (drinks package, gratuities, internet) and $500 OBC. A super pleasant surprise!

I realize this might be a bit of an outlier case as most people won‚Äôt spend so much time in the casino. And in the long run I‚Äôd probably be giving the casino back all the money they‚Äôre offering given my rate of play (the casino always wins).

I would really appreciate any tips you all could give me- when to book, what to look for as far as deals, should I be talking to a travel agent, are there any credit cards I should sign up for that might get me points or discounts?

So far it looks like the Princess cruises are the most affordable and have the excursions we would like best. I have a booking ""on hold"" while I do more research and one of my biggest questions is how far in advance do I need to book? Are there advantages to booking early? Booking late?

I had a few standing questions and what to typically expect.

1. Does Royal Carribean provide baby monitors? If not, are we able to bring a wifi one, pay for the on board wifi and use that?
2. Related to question one. Would this be generally frowned upon? We typically give him 10 mins or so to fall back asleep on the rare chance he does wake up though.

Cruise,"We booked our flights with NCL as a package. Today we are supposed to fly out to get on a cruise for tomorrow (no deviation). Our flight is already 4 hours delayed and there is a very high chance we will miss our connection and therefore not make it on the boat. What can we do now to try and help the situation? I've read from other threads NCL won't help at all and ask you to deal with the carrier directly but we can already tell the carrier won't be able to help us because there are literally no other flight options it offers to get to our destination.


Edit (more info):  We did not purchase travel insurance. This is international (Air Canada). We depart from EWR to YYZ then then YYZ to CPH (boat leaves tomorrow at 4pm). YYZ to CPH is on time. The issue is EWR to YYZ which means we will likely miss the connection. 

Update: Our flights were completely canceled by NCL while we were working with Air Canada and now they cannot help us. They were really trying too. They first tried to get us to leave from another airport (JFK) but the tickets had restrictions that wouldn‚Äôt allow that. They then found another option from EWR but the tickets were yanked while they were in the middle of making the changes. As of now we have been on hold over 2 hours trying to reach NCL. We can‚Äôt even access our NCL reservation anymore in the app (it‚Äôs in ‚Äúcruise‚Äù mode even though the cruise is over 24 hours away).

Update 2: 2.5 hours later we reached someone. They put us back on hold as they look into things. We can see the that the flight was removed from the reservation on NCL‚Äôs website on a desktop. It says we owe another $3,300. My theory is the flight team went to make a change and are locked out because we won a bid upgrade. This is just a theory; no idea if anyone had something like this happen with a bid upgrade award.

Update 3: air department said there is nothing they can do to help and transferred me to the resolutions department. On hold for 40 min so far.

Final Update 4:  NCL offered to rebook us on a direct flight from JFK; however there was no way we could have realistically made it in time through security as it took over 4 hours on the phone with NCL to reach this point. The risk would have been 100% on us. We asked for a full refund instead and were granted it. We are taking an Uber back home nearly 8 hours later.

Cruise,"Anyone else feel like cruise prices are advertised ‚Äúartificially‚Äù low in the sense that I‚Äôm looking at a 4 day on the Carnival Radiance in Aug 15.

It‚Äôs marketed at $154 per person on double occupancy. But once I add in the port fees, taxes, gratuities, drink package (who is getting on a carnival ship sober), Wi-Fi (who is not going to use the internet), it becomes an eye popping $600-700 per person!!! And that is not including the excursions and extras - which will land this near $800-1000 per person. 

Not saying that I‚Äôm not willing to pay that, as it is still good value for money but the $154 ‚Äúad‚Äù figure is so completely off from the final price.

Not sure if this is to get people committed with the initial price and start piling on the extras? 

Anyways when you see cruise fares do you just assume it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfake artificially‚Äù low price and you just have to double or triple it?",Artificially low advertised cruise price,,New-Friendship3326,,74,2022-08-05 18:49:21

I really want to try murano, however i don't understand if there is an entry fee while also having to pay for the items on the menu. it says 60$ starters on the app, is every item worth like 60$?? do speciality dining packages show up closer to sail or does it just not apply on this ship. the menus just look so good! i also remembet some people saying a steak was wonderful at a certain place so i'd love to know what you ordered.

Cruise,"My family and I recently sailed on a Carnival closed loop from NYC down to the Caribbean and back.  On the second to last day, several of my family members came down with Covid and we stayed in our rooms.  When we docked back in New York, Carnival took all the Covid positive guests and had us gather in a separate area of the ship where we'd be taken off separate from everyone else.

While we were waiting there, my kid needed to go to the bathroom, so my wife had to take him all the way back to the cabin which took a while.  During that time, the staff went ahead and took all the other Covid passengers off while I stayed back waiting on my wife &amp; kid.  After a while they finally returned and the staff told us just down walk down the gangway and make a left for the ground transportation area and that was all.  So that's what we did.  We were never met by anyone from customs or anything like that, we simply walked to the street and left.

I didn't think much of it, but now on this other thread where the OP is asking if he can sneak beer off the ship when he returns, and everyone is saying it won't work because you've got to clear customs when you return and they may find it.

But we literally just walked off the ship and to the street.  I haven't gotten a call or anything from the cruise line or customs, so I'm guessing I didn't do anything wrong?",Was I supposed to have gone through customs when I got back?,,LiterallyAHippo,,37,2022-08-05 12:07:00

im 22F and i have never been on a cruise. my ideal vacation would be renting a cabin in the middle of nowhere, not interacting with strangers, and swimming/reading by a lake all day. a cruise sounds like the opposite of that, and i've never had any desire to go on one. but my boyfriend's parents were kind enough to surprise me and buy a ticket for me to join their big extended family trip.

it's 5 days away, and im trying to be positive about it but it seems so stressful. already dealt with getting a passport and booster shot, now trying to figure out covid test. there's supposed to be rain and thunder the entire week. im scared about what that will be like in the middle of the ocean and worried it will make things feel more crowded if things get closed for weather. im very worried about food. i have celiac disease and even one crumb of gluten can make me sick. im very introverted so im nervous about the idea of being around so many people. i am chronically ill and get sick easily, so im also worried about germs spreading. and lastly, i have barely any money and it seems like all they do on these things is try to encourage you to spend more.

Cruise,"We were locked out on deck the first day during strong winds with my toddler. I got vertigo and throw up ready and almost passed out trying to hold toddler up and knock on all the locked doors. 

My toddler got burnt by the whole shower water fluctuating every few seconds and refused to get in the shower for the rest the trip. 

The AC in our room didn‚Äôt work so getting out of the shower after being scolded was extremely upsetting since it was so cold. 

The shower drain didn‚Äôt work and took from 7am till we got back on the ship it was still holding water and we used all of our towels every night on the floor to soak up all the water from leaking into the bedroom. 

The toilet only flushed at random so that was interesting. 

We called maintenance day two and they only came to look at the toilet, it still happened. 

They changed us rooms on the very last night after calling when my screaming toddler had an accident and refused yo get in the shower of fear getting scalded and that sucked. 

It was a summer cruise leaving July 21st to Alaska and everyone we spoke to said the kids pool would be open before we left. The kids pool they told us would be open the entire time never opened even during hot weather and they didn‚Äôt tell us till the night before the last day that it wasn‚Äôt actually going to open at all. 

That wouldn‚Äôt be so bad except we were locked out on deck the first night and it seems little but it actually scared the shit out of me and my toddler so we were stuck in the inside room the whole time or walking around inside with nothing to do but normal eat/sleep/walk around inside until the ship docked. 


Also my partner and I are in the service industry and tip often and well; we saved up for the this trip and this purpose. Then we get slapped with a 16$ per day per person gratuity charge that was an unexpected 550$ bill for people who saved a year and a half to do this.

First time posting here and this will be my first cruise.

We will be cruising Princess, as that was our original cruise line for Alaska. 

We are deporting and arriving from Ft Lauderdale. We booked a balcony room with the beverage package. I will be 24 when we cruise and my girlfriend will be 22. 

Our cruise will hit the following ports:

Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands

Is there anything we absolutely have to do in any of these ports? I would like to snorkel if possible and she would like to just find a nice beach, which I think both are possible.

How is the princess cruise line down there?

Cruise,"Hi!

I am not highly sure on what direction to look into with cruises. I have a lot of questions.

First of all, what exactly is a cruise line?

 I know there is no best cruise line, and depends on your needs. I am torn between the contemporary cruise line (which I heard is suppose to be energetic and for everyone) vs Premium (relaxed and focuses on vacation experience). This trip is actually for my dad who has been drained in work, and just tired all around. So I am leaning towards Premium since all of us are adults and it seems more focused our relaxing part. However, premium sounds expensive, and we heard the food is good on the contemporary lines, and there is more stuff to do there. Would be disappointed if we go on premium and realized its only about sitting down.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my requirements:

1. 1 week or less.
2. Depart within US (preferably in Texas)
3. Budget friendly (Also what is the norm rate which would be considered budget friendly)

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys recommend? If you notice I am not asking the right questions, please point me towards what I should research before I ask questions. Thanks in advance!",First time planning for a cruise for me (25 male) and my parents (in their 50s). Please read text. Any help would be appreciated.,,GetStuffTogether,,15,2022-08-03 19:44:13

Cruise,"I'm seeing some stupid cheap prices on NCL's cruise aboard the Joy out of NYC on October 29th for 7 days.  If I go, it'd be me, my mother in law, my one year old kid, and my six year old kid.

For roughly the same price we could either get two balcony staterooms, or one family suite, which is a bit over 500 sq ft and has two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a living area.  The family suite is an interior room, but it has some goofy ""virtual balcony"" where one wall is an image of the outside or something.  I'm not really knowledgeable about NCL's terminology, but I don't believe this is considered part of the the haven.  Either way it'd be my mother in law and the baby in one room, and me and the six year old in the other.

I'm kind of leaning towards the suite, but would like any input.  We just got off a Carnival cruise a couple weeks ago where we had two balconies and rarely used them.  They weren't really in a great location, though.  

Also, how's sailing down to Bermuda in late October/November?  The fares are so cheap it makes me think there's something wrong, but from my brief Googling I don't see any red flags.  Looks like hurricane season should be mostly over.

Recently, I went on a Celebrity Cruise and played blackjack for about an hour. In the end I was down $100, but I thought I'd be out a lot sooner lol.

I had them scan my Ship ID Card before I started playing and asked to be rated, however, they did not know what ""being rated"" meant.

Cruise,"We are about to book for Alaska in July 2023. As we are travelling from the UK, it's not going to be cheap so we want to get it right. We have narrowed it down to Majestic Princess and Norwegian Encore. 

Majestic 16 nights (including flights) vs 10 Encore

Majestic has more ports, but some of them are repeats (it's a round trip from Vancouver which is also sold as 2 separate trips)

Both cruises visit the following;
Ketchikan (twice on Majestic)
Jeneau (twice on Majestic)
Skagway
Glacier Bay (twice on Majestic)

If we book with Majestic we get the following ""extra"" places compared with Encore;

College Fjord
Whittier (Anchorage)
Hubbard Glacier
Icy Straight point

On Encore we would also visit Victoria and would look at adding a couple of nights in Vancouver at the end.

My questions are , are any of the ""extra"" places unmissable (ie shore excursions you can't do elsewhere)? Are the places that Majestic visits twice worth repeating in the same cruise?

For a bit of background, we have done 12 cruises with a few different lines. We have sailed with Princess in the Far East, but have never used NCL. We like the idea of trying a new line, but want to make sure we get the best out of our trip.

Cruise,"We just got back from a family trip aboard the NCL Encore and I wanted to share my thoughts - this subreddit has been so helpful I wanted to give back a bit. Our trip left Seattle, hit Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, and Victoria.

**tl;dr** \- Great ship (size, layout, amenities, rooms), awesome itinerary, really poor kids club and below age 10 kid experience, mediocre food.

**Pros:**

* Lots of amenities on the ship. It's new; you can feel it.
* Bars and lounges were great. Really enjoyed the whisky bar and the vibe at Mojito was great every night.
* Entertainment and shows were solid (if you're lucky enough to get in)
* Some of the best service and staff we've experienced on a cruise, with the exception of the kid's club and basically all staff facing the younger kids. Your room steward was amazing.
* The itinerary was great.
* Ship was only at 2/3 capacity, which made it feel busy, but not crowded.
* The Deck 15 Observation Lounge is a great place to hang out.

**Cons:**

* Kids Club. Limited hours (some days only open Noon-2pm). Limited capacity (20-60 kids). It's the hunger games of parents to get their children in. We sadly were only able to get our kids in one afternoon during the whole cruise. Plan on arriving 30 minutes before it opens and hope you get in line. As a result, we couldn't go to the 18+ comedy or other shows. Also, they don't have care for kids under 5, and they don't serve them food or drinks. As such, you need to feed your kids first before sending them.
* Pool Hours. Limited as well. It's too cold in Alaska to enjoy, but in Victoria and Seattle, you can really enjoy it if they are open. Sadly, hot tub hours mimic the pool hours, so you can't enjoy them either.
* Food was mediocre. The buffet was better than most restaurants, including specialty dining. The steakhouse (Cagneys) was hyped as great, but the steak was overcooked, and the desserts were inedible. We literally spit them out and left to get something better elsewhere. The American Grill never opened the entire cruise for some reason.

**Other Notes:**

* Embarkation was easy, as long as you do all the ArriveCAN and Covid stuff ahead of time. A little stressful, but it was pretty smooth at the terminal. Honestly, don't feel like you need to get on the ship right away. Getting on at 2pm is a breeze.
* We stayed at the Marriott Waterfront the night before, and it's a great spot because you can walk to the ship the next day - it's right across the street!
* Go-Karts are fun, but pricy. $15/ride is a little excessive IMO
* Lazer Tag is also fun - but again, $10/pop is a lot.
* Our kids enjoyed the VR game room, but you have to do it in hour blocks, and you can knock out about everything in 30 minutes.
* Internet service was terrible (but it usually is on ships anyway). I clocked it at 0.30 Mbps download and 0.10 Mbps upload. Barely able to send emails at sea. Plan on switching back to your cell phone in every port.
* Casino was great, BJ tables had $10/min every night. Also some fun BJ and Poker tournaments throughout the cruise.
* It's a Pepsi ship, but they have Sprite and Dr. Pepper. Very odd combo.

**Ports**

* Juneau: We arrived at 3pm, which we thought would be bad, but it was great. We went panning for gold, then a salmon bake, and then took the tram up the mountain right before sunset. Highly recommend the tram (but it's expensive). We heard from others that every whale-watching trip was canceled FYI.
* Skagway: Great little town. We did the sled dogs - highly recommend with kids. The best seafood in town is also the closest to the port, which can make it crowded. It was cloudy, helicopter tours were getting canceled here.
* Ketchikan: One of my favorite Alaskan towns, but realize that NCL docks in Ward Cove, which is a 20-minute bus ride from town. Also, the limited hours here made it sucky for those without excursions planned. We booked a private fishing charter - it was 25% the cost of booking through NCL, and it picked us up right at the dock. Plan ahead here.
* Victoria: Again, another late and short stop. Arrived at 8pm, left at 11pm. Cute town, but not much you can really do here due to the itinerary.  


**Final Thought**

If we had known about the limited kids club and childcare services in advance, we likely would not have booked NCL. We enjoyed the rest of our cruise, but had much better experiences on RC. Also heard from other cruisers that Carnival, RC, and Disney all have full kid's club hours and experiences. ",Norwegian Encore - Alaska - 7/24-7/31 Review,,investor100,,2,2022-08-03 06:00:27

Cruise,"Went on a 4 day trip last month on the Carnival Magic. It was our 4th cruise, 2nd with Carnival. For this cruise , I joined this subreddit and the Carnival one, and came across the posts about the perks you may get if you use the casino.  Based on this, and the fact that we were walking across the casino going to the theater when a lady hit a $10k jackpot, we decided to throw some money into the slots.  


We are not gamblers by any means. We threw in about $100 and didn't win anything.  I've seen the posts saying that people usually need to spend 200, 500 and even 1000 to see casino promos in their email.  Well  2 weeks ago I got an Players Club email with heavily discounted rates for certain dates, starting at $40pp.  


Tonight I got the Free rooms email. There are $50 dollar pp rates with equal onboard credits, making the room ""free"", with the exception of taxes and fees.  I can actually book a 6 nighter for the wife's birthday in February for $519 minus a $200 OBC and free drinks at the casino which is pretty freaking good!

Cruise,"Sorry for the extremely long post!

This is from a point of view of a late 20s/early 30s Canadian couple from Vancouver who is riding cruises for the first time. Please do not make negative comments on our choices. Since we are of lower average income, we did not have the leisure to afford the fancier cruise rooms, many of the popular excursions or restaurants. We decided that most excursions were not really worth it for us as we are not much of nature people, but more animal people. $600 USD to helicopter to a glacier to walk for 10 min did not appeal to us. Instead we opted to do the musher camps. We also decided not to eat at any of the ports to save money, and come back to Lido to eat ‚Äì except at Ketchikan where we tried the King Red Crab legs. This is merely a guide for all first time cruises looking to cruise to Alaska, especially under Holland America. The cruise website doesn‚Äôt tell you a whole lot and it took a lot of effort to get information from all sources.

We booked the Koningsdam with Holland America because we wanted a cruise that comes back to Vancouver, and one that passes by Glacier bay which so many people have recommended. Holland America is one of the cheaper cruises compared to others because it is smaller and it caters more to older people so the cruise does not have a lot of amenities like a rock climbing wall or pool slides etc. We weren‚Äôt going to do any of that so this was perfect for us. If you love partying and drinking then I suggest not Holland. We also heard that the lineups are long on bigger boats because the ratio of people to amenities isn‚Äôt linear. The upside is also there are less children on the Holland compared to others from what I‚Äôve heard. We booked the cheapest option which is the inner stateroom which was around $800 CAD per person. It seemed fairly reasonable since this included all meals. If you want a window, it would be \~$1000 CAD, balcony $1300, suite (with living room) $2100. We can always go to Lido buffet or the pools to look out windows if we wanted ‚Äì there are lounge seats there. We also didn‚Äôt get the ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù package which was $600 CAD for all you can drink, a shore excursion credit of $100 USD, 1 night dining at their paid fine dining restaurants, and Wi-Fi. I am very intolerant to alcohol (so much vomitting &gt;&lt;) so it wasn‚Äôt worth it for us to get that package. I also heard Wi-Fi is terrible on board since they have 3 tiers. The lowest tier is you can only go on social media ‚Äì like texting but no videos. 2nd tier - email, news. premium tier - streaming (not sure if you can stream youtube). We found out that without buying the Wi-Fi, you can still get updates on the navigator app, and access to google and google only (you can‚Äôt click on your searches but you can read the summary of searches haha).

Book when there is a $50 USD credit per person, and this deal is often. Some advertisements may try to lure you and say ‚Äúup to $300 credit‚Äù but that is for the luxury rooms. This will offset one of the hidden fees, which is gratuity. This is $15.50 USD per person per day that they automatically charge you and they don‚Äôt tell you that unless you really read into it. Some cruises have the fees built into their pricing so you don‚Äôt get hit by this afterwards. I really rather have it part of the cruise price in the beginning because I did not account for this in my budget. $15.50 for 7 days is $108.5 USD per person which is a lot of money (17% of my cruise price). I‚Äôve read forums and forums about how it might be split evenly among all crew members, or how Holland America takes a chunk out of it. I don‚Äôt know the truth. We were going to pay for all of it but due to poor service, we decided to lower it ‚Äì more on this later. Other extra costs I‚Äôve heard is docking fees, which I think most cruises already have it in their original prices. These are just things to be aware of.

We booked on deck 7 as our TA advised that deck 8 is right below the pools and you will hear them dragging the chairs early in the morning. The TA said it‚Äôs best to have rooms surrounding you to muffle the noise. The TA also advised that if you are prone to seasickness, the front rooms would move the most, followed by the back, and then the middle. Lower decks will also have less movement. The middle rooms were all booked when we planned this so we booked on in the back. This said, the days at sea, you can really feel the boat move a lot ‚Äì the water sloshes while you shower and it was difficult to sleep because of the rocking which also caused creaking in the ceiling. Maybe this is less so on deck 1 or 4 but you have to consider that all the amenities are above/below you. You can also go for the ‚Äúguaranteed cabin‚Äù which is slightly cheaper than picking your own room but you can be assigned to an upgrade suite, or a suite you didn‚Äôt want. We didn‚Äôt choose this because we didn‚Äôt want to have rooms in the front since the TA warned us of seasickness, but after experiencing the back, I didn‚Äôt feel sea sick at all so maybe I‚Äôll go for this option in the future.

Koningsdam is a fairly new cruise and is one of the bigger fleets from Holland America. Everything was modern looking and it had 3 small stages for live music, a big theater, a photo studio, a casino, several shops, more paid fine dining restaurants than the smaller ships, and pools on both ends. They play new movies at the front pool almost everynight. We watched ""death on the nile"" ""dog"" and ""uncharted"" while swimming. The shops sells some souvenirs you can already find at the port, except the ones at the ports are much cheaper. There are some Holland America specific souvenirs if you‚Äôd like to purchase them. The classical music shows were little lackluster ‚Äì very simple pieces. B.B. King however was fantastic. The events were also lackluster. They had a ‚Äúpolar bear plunge‚Äù at the pool and we thought they would throw ice in the pool but they just made people jump into the pool and back out to say a polar bear oath. Their ‚Äúpermission do dance‚Äù were obviously catered to old people with very simple moves. Take note of all the raffles happening. We won $100 USD at the Greenhouse Spa raffle! The EFFY jewelry store does raffles every day but obviously for cheap jewelry and they never start on time. They say raffle in 5 min but it may be 30 min later ‚Äì to make people come in and look at jewelry. They also keep having deals where if you buy something they would throw in ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù jewelry which I think are probably very low grade diamonds or else they wouldn‚Äôt be giving it away. They do have mimosas every day if you‚Äôre into that. The day before we arrived at Juneau there was a ‚Äúshopping expert‚Äù talk and you guessed it, it was all about jewelry. Please do your research if there are some specific souvenirs you would like to buy. However, I did learn that you can collect free charms, pendants, or coins from jewelry stores at each port. The downside is that the charms were so cheaply made that it either came broken or it falls off while wearing. You can tell that some were a different batch by the clasps. The ones with the lobster claw clasps were more stable. The ones with the spring ring clasps breaks easily. Port specific coins can be collected at Milano stores although Juneau didn‚Äôt have them when I went so I am missing one „Öú.„Öú . Monarch is where you collect the Alaskan state flower pendant which is a different color at each port.

On dressy days, you only need to dress up for dinner time at formal restaurants and the Dining Room is considered formal. If you don‚Äôt care about this, then you can just go to Lido for the buffet and dress however you like. We only went to the Dining Room during formal days because it had a more special menu. Honestly, the Dining Room food is 80% from Lido. We just get the specials like the shrimp cocktail and lamb rack from the Dining Room and then go to Lido after to eat the rest of the things we want to try. Lido is awesome. It has many stalls offering different foods each day. The salad bar is always the same I think. The breakfast is also always the same for all stalls. They have a distant lands stall which serves different country cuisines each night but I have no idea what kind of fusion it is because it did not taste like any of the dishes they say they were. I am coming from Vancouver so food diversity and authenticity is great here. Nevertheless, some were still delicious though, whatever it is. The line ups aren‚Äôt bad, except on days where only Lido is open (first/last day). We never had to make a reservation at the Dining Room either ‚Äì they said that they portion out some seats for reservation and some for walk-ins.

Most of the staff is friendly. However, we can clearly see some discrimination against us and it could be because we didn‚Äôt order the drink package, or buy individual drinks. Or maybe we weren‚Äôt a white old couple that is likely to splurge on things on the boat. I couldn‚Äôt put a finger on it because the majority of the guests on the boat were white old couples so the data is skewed. The waiters would always pay more attention to those people and refill their drinks often. They would also say much more appreciative languages like ‚Äúit is such a pleasure to be serving you‚Äù instead of the nothingness that we keep getting. Most of the time, our waters won't get refilled, and even sometimes, we didn‚Äôt even get water. This happened not only one time but for all meals since day 1. We waited until day 6 to see if things would change and since it didn't, we decided to lower the daily gratuity. It was fairly easy to do at the Guest Services desk. They just ask you to fill a form and then write the reason. We decided to give $7/day instead of $15.50 because we do understand that the money is probably split with the cleaners that also work very hard every day. This works out well because we have a $50 USD credit, so this covers the whole 7 day gratuity. We used the difference and gave the extra money directly to our room steward who was really awesome, and some of the servers behind the food at Lido ‚Äì they were all wonderful accommodating people.

Note ‚Äì everything on the ship is paid by your room card which is linked to your credit card. When you check in for your cruise, they will ask you to link your credit card to navigator account so that they can start having a charge hold each day on your card for gratuities and whatever you buy. The actual charge does not come in until after you disembark. And alternate way is to give $600 USD cash to the Guest Services at the start of cruise instead of linking your credit card. They hold it for you and see if you spend on things, and at the end you pick up the money you didn‚Äôt spend. It is a weird system. Make sure to take a picture of yourself on the navigator app. Right now Holland America still requires fully vaccinated travelers and a negative antigen test within 2 days before boarding. We recommend you to pick up a free pack of tests at your local pharmacy and book and appointment on lifecenters.ca - it is $20 for the first person and $5 for additonal people who will be doing the session with you at the same time. It is the cheapest option I found. You must also fill in the ArriveCan before you embark. If you want to speed up boarding process, download Verifly and upload all your vaccination documents there. 

The first day you embark on the boat, you will have to watch the safety video in your stateroom TV, and find your muster station (name of muster station is on your room key card and the map is on the room door). Go there at whatever time they listed and a staff will be there to scan your card. There is also a form to fill your ArriveCan confirmation code where you either hand it to the Guest Service desk or to your stateroom attendant. Everything is free to watch on your stateroom TV. The TV is glitchy at times. Mostly older movies with some sprinkle of newer movies. They also have ‚Äúchannels‚Äù which I don‚Äôt think are linked to the actual channels on land because some of the food shows are cut into small portions. The stateroom has its own temperature controller so you can be comfortable. There is a safe, a mini fridge (drinks cost money), 2 robes, an umbrella, and 2 bigger towels for beaches. You don‚Äôt need to bring a towel to the swimming pool as there are towels provided there already. The front of the boat is has a closed pool with 3 hot tubs (the roof can open a bit on sunny days). This is also where the Dive-In Burger Cafe and the New York Pizza (both included in your ticket) are. The burgers are fantastic, and the pizza I would recommend doing the ‚Äòcreate your own‚Äô. There is a bar and also a gelato place here too (not free). Also here, is the fountain pop machine! The only 2 on the boat is located here. If you order pop from the servers, you will have to pay, but instead you can come here to get the fountain version of it. The back of the boat has an open pool with 2 hot tubs. This is also where the party is when the boat first starts to move. They served free hors d'oeuvre there.

I think this is all I can think of. On to the stops!

Juneau is a nice city but we couldn‚Äôt explore much of it because we disembarked at 1pm, our excursion was 3pm, and we got back at 5:30pm. Most stores are closed then. It has a little park with food trucks ‚Äì I think two of them were Filipino cuisine and one was a hotdog stand. The downtown is very close to the dock. Once you disembark, there are many excursion stalls trying to sell you things for a discount. If you were on the fence about an excursion, I advise you do come see the discounts. Some are 2 for 1. There are free bathrooms inside city hall. Somewhere there (online forums said the library but we couldn‚Äôt get any at the library), there is free wifi, but not strong enough to send bigger files. Pictures may or may not be sent. 80% of Juneau are jewelry stores. The other 20% are souvenir stores. The Alaskan shirt company is the most popular one and you can get a lot of trinkets there for fair prices. Don‚Äôt worry if you didn‚Äôt have enough time here, the same store exists in Skagway and more or less has the same things. We booked the ‚ÄúJuneau Musher's Camp &amp; Sled Dog Discovery‚Äù excursion through Alaska Shore Excursions. It was great! They take you on the bus directly to the camp. We sledded across a muddy forest for about 5 min with a stop in between. The guide helped take pictures of the dogs for you on your phones. After the sledding, they gave us wet wipes to wipe our hands and clothing. There was a little suspension bridge near the place where they talk about sledding history and they give you time to check that out. The same musher gave the sledding history talk and was very interesting. The musher knew a lot about what they were talking about. Afterwards, we were taken to two pens where there were ‚Äúteenager‚Äù dogs, which we can only pet through the fence, and then the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù dogs, which we were allowed to hold and take pictures. Absolutely adorable. There is a little station nearby with places to wash your hands and to make tea/coffee/hot chocolate. This was $133 USD per person for 2.25 hours. Tracy‚Äôs Crab Shack is popular here with $75 for a king crab leg. Deckhand Dave's taco is a popular food truck. Coppa is a popular ice cream shop. They didn't have the fireweed honey ice cream I wanted to try that day.

Skagway was the smallest city. It is also about a 10 min walk to downtown from the dock. There is a free bathroom on your way to downtown that has native carving on it. We originally wanted to book the White Pass train but due to Covid, it wouldn‚Äôt go to Yukon. There was also maintenance on the tracks so it wasn‚Äôt going to go too far. We decided to do the ‚ÄúWhite Pass Summit &amp; City Tour‚Äù with Frontier Excursions. The guide drove us around downtown and up to the Gold Rush Cemetery, and walked up to the Lower Reid waterfalls there. Then we drove on the side of the mountains all the way up as they spoke about some of the history of the town. We passed by several scenic spots to take pictures and went all the way up to the Canadian/USA border where you can stop on both sides at the same time. What‚Äôs interesting about this border is that they decided that the border stations were not going to be at the actual border, but way before and way after the border, so there is some unknown territory in between. Very cool. We passed by the Welcome to Alaska sign and also the Bridal Veil Falls. The tour was average to us since we‚Äôre not very scenic people but we did want to go to the border and the sign and this was the cheapest option at $52 per person for 3 hours. Since we had a lot of time in Skagway, we decided to look for another tour. We only saw 2 booths ‚Äì M&amp;M tours and Frontier Excursions. We decided to do the Musher camp again since we loved it so much. Frontier was offering for $133 USD per person and told us all other tours would be the same price, but M&amp;M was $139. We went with Frontier, and guess what, both Frontier and M&amp;M guests were picked up by the Alaskan Shore Excursion bus (same company as the one in Juneau). This tour was longer at 3.25 hours. That‚Äôs because you need bus to a site first, and then ride a very very slow tractor up the mountain where the camp actually is. They made us sit at the front with the driver and we could not hear a thing the tour guide was saying in the back. Very unfortunate‚Ä¶ When we were there, they immediately put us on a sled and it just seemed very rushed. The ride was a lot shorter than Juneau and the time spent taking pictures and petting the sled dogs was also very rushed. No wet wipes here. They also had a sledding history talk but not by our musher, but another person who just told jokes most of the time rather than the actual history. We felt it was not very professional compared to the Juneau one, although they are the same company. Also no free drinks. They had very little ‚Äúteenage‚Äù pups but a lot more ‚Äúbaby pups‚Äù so I could hold at least 3 different ones. Then we tractor back down to the first site where there was a bathroom to wash your hands, and some souvenir shops. This Skagway one was definitely a letdown and I would advise you to choose the Juneau one. Not much to do in Skagway since it is so small. It really would have been nice to arrive earlier at Juneau rather than Skagway. The giant donuts at Klondike Doughboy is popular here (they also sell jams and honeys).

On the way to Glacier Bay they boat picks up some park rangers who will tell you about the history. You will pass by several smaller glaciers. The boat stops for 1 hour at Margerie Glacier and we spent the whole 1 hour to finally see a small calving event. Once in a lifetime kinda thing.

Ketchikan was the biggest city out of our stops. Nobody is selling excursions near the dock. There is one tourist center if you walk a little into downtown but I think Ketchikan is the stop where people say has the least fun excursions because it‚Äôs no glacier nor train lol. There are bathrooms there. This city has the least amount of jewelry stores and more local stores selling seafood and other things. Pass by Creek Street where all stores are built above the water. I chatted with some local kid who was fishing for Coho there. We went to Sam McGee‚Äôs to pick up some fireweed honey which was on my list. There are totem poles scattered throughout the city. We also went to eat at the Alaskan King Crab Co. which for some reason has the same menu as Annabelle's Famous Keg &amp; Chowder House; however, Annabelle‚Äôs King Crab leg was $59.99 USD and King Crab Co was $49.99. We ordered one leg, clam chowder, and crab wontons. The leg was very meh, and I never went to Tracy‚Äôs King Crab Shack in Juneau so I can‚Äôt compare, but Tracy‚Äôs is $75 for a leg, and judging from the pictures, our leg was about the same size. The clam chowder was thick and the soup base was yummy but not a lot of clams. The crab wontons were like crab rangoon ‚Äì crab + cream cheese except I thought there would be real crab but I don‚Äôt see any. Disappointing =(.  There are lots of different ethnic restaurants here compared to Juneau and Skagway. We spent about 4-5 hours walking around, checking out the stores and eating.

Cruise,"Hi all, 

I'm a beginner Cruiser (have only been to 1 RC LA to Ensenada cruise) - absolutely had a blast. Now thinking of taking my parents too, for a longer on in Europe. There are 2 that we like: 

Option 1: Norwegian - Northern Europe - 10 days, 9 cities, 6 countries - Sept 16 to Sept 26

Option 2: Royal Caribbean - Mediterranean - 7 days, 3 countries, 5 cities - Oct 16 to Oct 23 

I like the itinerary of the NCL but it's a v old ship (Norwegian Dawn) whereas the Royal Caribbean is offering the Symphony of the Seas which is supposed to be a really nice ship. 

Assuming that this is the only chance I get to take my parents on a cruise, which should that be? They would prefer seeing a lot of places but I don't want us to be stuck in an sad old ship.. 

Cost wise, the interior option of NCL = Balcony for the RCL

Cruise,"I own an extreme phobia of flying. If I don't have a panic attack the very moment I step foot on the plane, prompting the crew to escort me‚Äç off, I'll have one as soon as we take off, and will endure several hours of pure Hell in which I feel like I am serially made to live out my own death. The anticipatory anxiety is also terrible: the last time I geared up to fly (a meager two hour domestic flight), I spent over a *week* with horrible stomach issues and frequent episodes of nausea and vomiting. I even vomited up blood at one point and had to go to the ER. Extended testing confirmed that I was completely fine; lo and behold, my issues resolved instantly when I got off the plane. All of this is simply backstory to illustrate the gravity of my fear. In the fall, however, I will be relocating to Europe for a year, and I need to get there somehow. I figured I would be forced to take a plane, but I've been looking into other options, and it seems a boat trip would be financially feasible.

Cruise,"Many cruise lines are pushing their games (literally) to put a ton of high-tech entertainment options on board. I mean things such as freely accessible video game consoles.  
The innovation, however remains confined to the ""oldest kids"" subdivision of the onboard kids clubs. It is not accessible to those who have gone past their 18th birthday.

Even if I am past my thirties, I would enjoy being able to socialize on board around multiplayer video games &amp; other geeky/nerdy entertainment.

I have seen quite similar questions asked in other places, and answers were judgments about why to play video games on a cruise, or mentions about alcoholic drinks being accessible past 21. Drinking alcohol is definitely not something I enjoy; I always remain sober.  
In general, I prefer active entertainment where I do stuff, rather that sitting down to watch something.

Sure, there is an arcade onboard. Which is quite scarce on MSC ships (mostly prize machines but very few real games on Grandiosa, only one single working cabinet working on Seaview), and the other entertainment options are quite expensive &amp; short-lived (F1 simulator, XD theatre, VR maze) or reservations fill up too fast such as for the bowling alley. It is frustrating to see nice PS4 or Nintendo consoles on big TVs loaded with games ready to be played further down the deck, with no one on them... and a ""sorry, teens only"" tensabarrier in the middle next to the Attic Club.

I also thought about bring a Nintendo Switch and plug it into the stateroom TV. Depending on the ship, it may or may not work; sometimes the TVs are locked in a way that does not allow selecting the HDMI input. Was the case on MSC Grandiosa. Even if working, the fact that it is in the stateroom defeats the socializing factor.

Searching around this theme gives results named like ""Best cruises for teens"". It means, the industry strongly things that video games are a teenager-only form of entertainment.  
Are there any lines that have better offerings on video games available to adult geeks? Perhaps themed cruises?",Geek cruiser here.

Cruise,"This is just my experience so far, but would not recommend Princess for Alaska cruisetours. For reference, I booked ""Denali Explorer C"" on the Royal Princess.

Reasons I chose Princess over HAL:

\-They also go to Glacier Bay

\-I liked their itinerary better (before they changed it)

\-Newer ships (but I know bigger is not necessarily better in Alaska)

\-They seemingly had a more diverse age group than HAL

\-I thought I would be able to upgrade to the Tundra Wilderness Tour in Denali (this is included in the HAL cruisetour)

&amp;#x200B;

I had this cruise booked months and months ago. I understand we're in the middle of a pandemic but Princess just changed my itinerary without notifying me and without refunding my excursions. I was supposed to spend two nights in Denali but they've changed it so that I am now spending one night in Denali and two nights in Fairbanks, which our party has no interest in seeing. I am upset because I specifically chose this itinerary for those 2 nights in Denali.

I booked excursions on my credit card for our party but Princess cancelled them because of this itinerary change. However, Princess is also telling me that each individual person has to call to ask for it to be refunded. What on earth?? This refund should be automatic.

What kills me the most is that I spent 7 hours on the phone and Princess lied to me on multiple occasions. I spoke to three different Princess reps who all told me that this excursion was ""cancelled."" I spoke to the Denali Tundra Tour Operator - their tours are NOT cancelled, they are modified because of the rockslide. In fact, the tour operator told me that the seats were oversold. Yet the ""higher-ups"" for these Princess reps are telling them to insist that the tours have been cancelled for 2022.

When I was finally redirected to Customer Solutions, I was placed on hold for 5 hours. When rep picked up, I specifically asked for my number to be written down in the event we were disconnected. The rep took my phone number, repeated it back to me, then hung up on me when she was putting me on hold to ""look into the matter."" Never gave me a call back. I know this was on purpose because when I called the number back, another rep commented, ""That's odd, this person put a note down for your case but never put down her own name and just said that the customer disconnected."" Sure, we might have disconnected, but did I ever get a call back? No.

Mind you, I have been incredibly polite and patient with the reps when I am on the phone. I understand we are in a pandemic and these reps are not at fault for itinerary changes but I do not tolerate being lied to or hung up on. I also do not tolerate having my itinerary changed without notification, then not being able to receive a refund unless every individual person in my 8 person party calls to ask for a refund (most of whom do not speak English). I've been on a cruise before, and I have never had go to through this. I am now waiting on hold again so that I can at least receive a refund. I am never going to recommend Princess cruises simply because of the treatment I've received as a new customer. I would have much more appreciated honesty from their end. If they told me, ""Sorry, we oversold those seats,"" or ""Your itinerary was changed because of X,Y,Z"" I would have much more respect for Princess.

Cruise,"My dad (77) really wants to go on an Alaska cruise with my sister‚Äôs family and my own next summer before he gets too old. The issue is that my sister‚Äôs family‚Äôs needs/desires tastes are very different from my own‚Ä¶.

My sister‚Äôs kids are 9 and 12 years old. Her husband and her idea of a great vacation is getting served drinks and food by a pool while her kids are entertained by water slides or a camp or something. 

Next summer my kids will be around 1 and 3.5 years old. My husband and I are excited about traveling to Alaska for the nature. We are adventurous but understand that we are currently hindered by our young children‚Ä¶ 

Everyone in our families love good food so that‚Äôs a priority.

What cruise line has the best food? With local Alaska seafood would be amazing?

Are the pools on the Alaska cruises super heated and usable? My sister lives in LA and we‚Äôre all from Hawaii so we aren‚Äôt the best at handling cold water‚Ä¶

When is the best summer month to go?

Is Disney the only cruise that would make sense for my sister? I personally am repulsed by the idea as I just don‚Äôt like Disney and don‚Äôt want my toddler to be entranced by all that. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd love it but I‚Äôm trying to keep things screen free anti-consumerist crunchy as long as possible lol

Also how do you sleep in a cruise ship room with a toddler and baby? Will a travel crib fit?! Do the balconies have blackout curtains as the babies will need to nap so I was hoping I could hang on the balcony but I could keep the room dark.

Cruise,"I just got back from an absolutely fabulous vacation on the Norwegian Pearl from Boston to Bermuda (lucky me that I got off the boat before it struck that fishing boat!). I wanted to create a quick little review with some pros, cons, and other notes. I'll start with the pros!

**Pros**

* The boat is beautiful and there's always something to do!! We hit a rough day at sea and there was SO much to do to keep us occupied
* The staff was *so* friendly! We had a leak in our room that kept making our floor a mini swimming pool, and they really tried to accommodate us
* Honestly... I was on vacation. And that's a huge pro in of itself. Bermuda was lovely! Bar Harbor was lovely too, but I have so much more to say about Bar Harbor
* The drinks were great and always flowing! Shout out to the drink package
* I got to be a part of the Battle of the Sexes show and it was the most fun I've ever had on a boat! Again, the staff for this show was so upbeat and lively and friendly

**Cons**

* The food was honestly not that impressive, and the service was absolutely slow. Dinner took 2+ hours every night, thus making us late to the shows. I do want to say, though, that I don't think this is the fault of the staff. The staff was HUSTLING. I just think they're wildly understaffed
* The shows were also not impressive (I'm sorry)
* The port in Bar Harbor was the most annoying waste of my time. We had to tender into port, which is fine, but my GOD did it take hours. We were given tender ticket #1 (yay!) but we had to go through immigration, and our immigration group was called last (boo). Oh my god it took forever and it was so disorganized and genuinely no one knew what was going on. We docked at 10:00am but we didn't get to land until about 2:00pm!!! Ridiculous.

**Notes**

* Bonine knocks me OUT. I don't know if I was just tired, if the boat was rocking me to sleep, or if it was the bonine... but I'm assuming it was the bonine. I had to take like 2-3 naps a DAY just to stay awake (lol)
* The North Atlantic sea is uh... rough. Very rough. And windy!!! My sister got attacked by a deck chair on our first day at sea

I know some people on this sub have been on this boat/will be going on this boat. If you've been on this boat, do you have any additional notes? If you're going on the boat, do you have any additional questions??

Cruise,"It's my first cruise and I have a few questions if anyone could help. I called the customer service line and got some conflicting data from what's on their website, youtube review, etc.

I booked a 7 day Mexico cruise complimentary through venetian/palazzo in vegas which comes with a $400 on board credit if that changes or affects anything. For example, under preferences on the website I'm able to request a complimentary robe for myself but not additional passengers. The CS rep said robes cost $70 and aren't complimentary but may be a bonus/promotion through the casino.

1. Cash is recommended for casino, onboard credit can be used in casino or charged to room/account. If I charge it to my account which is linked to my credit card are there any fees through credit card (is it considered a cash advance or purchase?
2. CS rep said I can bring 5 (750ml) bottles of wine/person but everywhere else says 1 bottle per person?
3. $15 corkage fee for wine outside of room, is there any additional charge if we took it to a restaurant?
4. Can't use on board credit for specialty restaurant reservations until I board the ship. I wanted to try the steakhouse so paid with my credit card to gurantee my spot. Anyone have issues with getting a table for specialty restaurant once boarding the ship instead of doing a reservation beforehand?
5. Was told can't bring water or hard liquor onto ship, so should I just purchase the water package to be delivered to room?

Appreciate any advice or tips!

Cruise,"I thought I had made a decision, but I‚Äôm back to the drawing board and debating between the Celebrity Beyond (11 day) and the Norwegian Viva (9 day) for a Greece, Italy, Turkey cruise next year. 

The ports are almost identical with the Beyond beginning and ending in Civitavecchia, Italy and the Viva beginning in Athens and ending in Civitavecchia (the Beyond is 2 days longer). 

I‚Äôll be traveling with my husband and 13 year old. The Viva seems to have tons to do, but there are 0 sea days to take advantage, and it will only be the second cruise for the ship, so some kinks may need to be worked out. I‚Äôm also worried that it may have additional delays, since the June cruises were already cancelled. The Beyond is more established and seems lovely with 2 sea days for more relaxation. 

I managed to get a great deal on the Viva through a travel agent a few months ago, so the room we have booked (family concierge) is about $4500 cheaper than the comparable room on Beyond (infinity balcony). 

I‚Äôve booked both cruises while I decide (snagged the Elevate package with $1200 OBC from Celebrity during the 4th of July sale, which brings the price difference down a bit).

I guess I'm going to select I was ""exposed"" so I'm not charged??   How the hell do they even monitor this.....what's to stop all people from just selecting ""possible exposure"" to avoid getting charged for a Covid test??

When you do get your results, does it show on the results page the reason why you got the test? Or does it only show your result and the pharmacy name, etc.?   Any experience with getting tested pre-cruise at a pharmacy would be helpful.  Like I said, this is my first time doing this at all.

Cruise,"Just got off Rhapsody of the Seas a couple of days ago and thought I'd do a mini review.   


The Itinerary was as follows:  


* Rome (2 nights hotel stay) + boarding the ship
* Salerno (Amalfi Coast)
* Siracusa (Sicily)
* Santorini
* Kusadasi (Ephesus)
* Mykonos
* Athens 

Apart from the disaster of the airline losing our bags, we had an amazing time. 

The ship is on the small end of the scale, but has recently been amplified (refurbished) so all areas of the ship looked nice. It was sailing at close to full capacity, but didn't seem too crowded.

This was our first cruise sine RCI have introduced the eMuster drill and this is such a big improvement over the old style where you were always left waiting for that one family to turn up before you could be dismissed. We also found the app useful to check the events, MDR menus and to keep an eye on our spending.  

The guests were predominantly from USA and Canada, but there were also a lot from Latin America, and a few from the UK and Scandinavia. All announcements were made in English and Spanish. Much of the entertainment was aimed as North American guests, which made some of the quizzes a bit harder for us. The demographic on this cruise meant that most people didn't bother dressing up for formal nights (which was handy as we didn't have our luggage). 

The Cruise Director's staff was fantastic and really got the guests involved. Each event was lively and there was such a good atmosphere throughout the cruise. By the end of the cruise, it really was quite hard to say goodbye to them. 

The food in the MDR was okay, but I think there has been a slight drop in quality compared to previous cruises that we have taken. The service in the MDR was quick and friendly, but some of the other areas were very short staffed. There was rarely any floor staff taking orders in the venues and this made the bars very busy. There were no waiters taking drink orders in the Buffet or by the pool. 

We did independent trips in all ports, but usually had at least one family from the ship with us on each tour. In Salerno we did a boat trip with stops for swimming and visiting some of the towns. The rest of the trips were visiting historical sites.",Rhapsody of The Seas - Rome to Athens July 2022: Review,,IGSketchUK,,3,2022-07-28 19:21:55

I've seen a lot of people online recommend just booking it, then canceling and rebooking if the price drops later, but I believe NCL's cancellation policy changed recently, so you have you to cancel six months or greater in advance to receive a full refund.

Cruise,"Hello fellow cruisers, I recently disembarked Anthem after a cruise from Southampton through Spain and France. I was a little shocked by my experience and I wanted to check in with the group to see if this was a fluke or more normal. 

A couple things shocked me compared to previous cruises on Carnival and RC.

* MDR dining took nearly two hours each night, and the quality of the food was really really bad compared to prior RC cruises. We never had to wait since we had reservations but the actual process of eating took forever as courses came out very very slowly. 
   * This made us late to shows and with the full capacity ship, you need to arrive at least 30 mins ahead of the show to get a seat. 
* I'm not a neat freak, but this ship was a wreck. I'd go to the gym in the mornings and walk along the track and see old plates and cups from the night/day before on the deck. As well as spilled food and even vomit one time. 
   * There were never any clean tables in the Windjammer and even tables at Sorrentos or other quick dining spots were never refreshed after use. 
* Everyone, like a huge number of people, was sick. It was like a chorus of coughing and sneezing in the theaters. Unsurprisingly, I am still recovering from Covid I contracted while on the ship... (I am not upset about this, I knew the risk, just including for transparency).
* Capacity: Things are back to pre-Covid levels and this sailing was at 100% capacity. I don't mind the crowds but the ship was not staffed to keep up with this many people... it was hectic and I felt badly for the overworked staff.

Have other's sailing on RC or other cruise lines experienced this recently? My main concerns were the cleanliness and crew/guest ratio. I always book my next cruise shortly after I get off the last one, I love having one to look forward to, but I'm considering a different kind of vacation since this trip was a little disappointing.",Anthem of the Seas - Jul 15,,catdogs52,,30,2022-07-27 13:17:48
Cruise,"Hi all. 

I‚Äôll be going on my first 5-day cruise with Virgin Voyages this December to the Riviera Maya with two friends on the Scarlet Lady. I‚Äôm happy that they have solo rooms. 

The Solo Insider (no windows) is 105 sqft and $808.50 and the Solo Sea View (with porthole) is 130 sqft at $1,001 before taxes. The rate includes $600 credit for Wi-Fi, essential drinks, tips, food, and workouts. If my friend books today while on his current cruise, we get another $600 towards shopping and alcohol. 

My question is, which do you think is worth it?  For a room that small, having a window might make it feel a little bigger. For reference, I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô, 200 pound male. 

I would upgrade to the regular insider or the regular Seaview that fits two people (or the Sea Terrace that‚Äôs 225 sqft and $1,732.50 with a balcony, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth spending several hundred more on. 

I can afford any of the options (I just like being frugal where I can) and I like the idea of more space, but for a 5 day cruise for my first time, I feel like one of the solo cabins would be sufficient no?

Cruise,"My first cruise was with NCL, coincidentally to the Norwegian Fjords. No idea what to expect, or the differences between cruise lines; just the dates worked and it was a good price. 

Since then, I‚Äôve cruised the Caribbean with MSC, the Middle East with (now defunct) Pullmatur, and done a Rhine river cruise. 

However, I keep coming back to NCL. I like their offering, the laid back atmosphere, the drinks package included for ‚Ç¨99, etc. I‚Äôve never been disappointed. I‚Äôm three points away from platinum. 

This summer, however, I‚Äôm torn. I can do a 9 night cruise in the Baltic with NCL (Dawn), or an 11 night with RCL (Voyager) - I think by the time I include the price of the drinks package with Royal, the prices work out about the same, which is unusual. I rarely see RCL that cheap, especially as a solo cruiser. 

Anyone have any thoughts? Stay with what you know, and you know you will be satisfied; or try an unknown?

Realistically, I know I‚Äôll probably also be happy with RCL.

It says that ALL guests have to compete an entry form via ArriveCan. But I‚Äôm Canadian and already in Canada. I shouldn‚Äôt have to fill this out, right? Have they just worded it weirdly?

Speaking of wording it weirdly.  It says I need to be ‚ÄúFully Vaccinated‚Äù **or** ‚Äúup to date vaccinated‚Äù. 

Their definition of ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù is ‚Äúvaccinated with a full dose of a primary series vaccine‚Äù. Ok, check. That‚Äôs all good for me and my wife.

He went on a cruise with his family as a teen and is convinced from that time (I guess seeing people who did the MyTime waiting in line for dinner?) that the set time seating is the way to go. Plus the shows and other onboard activities are often scheduled around the set times. However, am I crazy to think the 5pm seating is way too early and going to throw off our schedule on a lot of days? He is more of a morning person than me, but even if we are both up early I‚Äôm also just thinking about logistics on shore excursion days.

His argument is that we can always do the buffet, or schedule our upscale dining days (we plan to treat ourselves and eat at the paid restaurants a few times on the trip) for the days where the 5pm time doesn‚Äôt work. Still, it feels to me why have to eat at a buffet on late excursion days when we could just do MyTime and be able to do MDR whenever we want?

I agree with him that the later seating time (7:45) is a no-go. I‚Äôd just prefer more like 6-7 if I had a choice.

In part due to the ship issues, missing a port that my partner wanted to visit, as well as the all in cost for an available balcony two doors down from me with equivalent packages was going for $2000 less than what I had paid for my room. We will try again next season. In the mean time, I'll be scrambling for something else to do next month.

---

Hoping to hear from people that have been on the Crown Princess in the last few months.

We are supposed to head out to Alaska on Crown Princess at the end of August. After having our Ketchikan stop cancelled, my partner started looking online to find out more information and found tons of terrible reviews of the ship due to mechanical issues. 

Now she wants cancel the trip and try again next year on a different boat. I'm sort of one board with cancelling as the prices of available equivalent rooms next to ours are going for half of what we paid with the same included packages.  

We really need a vacation and thought I would ask around if other's thoughts on this ship.

Other considerations, we haven't been on Princess before, but have been on Royal a few times.

Cruise,"My family, some friends, and I just finished sailing on Symphony last week (7/16-23) and I thought I‚Äôd write up some of my experiences. 

First of all, I‚Äôve been on Freedom &amp; Allure in the past, as well as Carnival Triumph. Symphony is the best ship I‚Äôve been on, neck and neck with Allure for sure ‚Äì but the added amenities/activities put Symphony way ahead. 

Here‚Äôs a bunch of thoughts! 

The ship was full but not over-crowded. When we were on Allure, there were a lot of large family groups that pushed the capacity to its limits. This was a nice change from that. We were able to get seats for all of the shows we wanted to see as well as use things like The Abyss and LaserTag without much trouble.

Bar service was incredible throughout the week, at all bars we went to. When we were on Allure, we didn‚Äôt get very personal service due to how crowded it was ‚Äì but this time I was very impressed with the staff and how quickly they knew ‚Äúmy drink‚Äù (Whistlepig Rye Old Fashioned, please!). Favorite spots were Schooner and the pub. 

LaserTag ‚Äì This was A BLAST. I‚Äôm 47 and used to be super into laser tag when it was a big deal in the early 90s. I felt like a kid again running around that inflatable course. They set it up on top of the ice rink, and it‚Äôs really quite cool. Wear something that‚Äôll look neat under a black light. Get in line early as they only take in 14 at a time, and the line wraps back to the casino. I was there 30mins before it started and was in the second group.

Escape Room ‚Äì This was also a blast. We reserved our slot earlier in the week ($20/pp) and we were grouped with some other folks for an overall team of 12. We ended up solving the last puzzle right at the buzzer (slightly after if I‚Äôm totally honest) but the screen behind us in the photos still says ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù so it counts in my book. I‚Äôve only done one escape room in the past, but this was better than that one and just really well put together. I didn‚Äôt expect to be impressed but I had a great time and would recommend it to anybody that loves puzzles. It fills up early and it didn‚Äôt seem like standby worked well for anybody. 

150 Central Park - Holy cow what a great meal we had there. I‚Äôm somebody who eats out at a lot of very fine places in Chicago and I‚Äôd put this meal up there with most of them, and wouldn‚Äôt have minded paying over $200+ for the tab. The food was incredible, as was the service. I know everybody raves about the fried cheesecake, which we had, but the other dessert ‚Äì a chocolate/PB tart with black current sorbet, was quite special. Really happy with this meal.

The Abyss (slide) ‚Äì This was a lot of fun! I went on it a few times and the line was never too long.

1977 (Ice show) ‚Äì I‚Äôm always amazed by what they can squeeze onto such a small performance space. The narrative of this one was pretty oddball but fun. Though the ‚Äúsmurf face‚Äù scene was a bit cringey‚Ä¶ lol.

‚ÄúHiro‚Äù (AquaTheater show) -  Just great! Don‚Äôt miss it. Seemed like they got all of the standby people in.

‚ÄúHairspray‚Äù ‚Äì Super fun and a really top-notch production.

Comedy ‚Äì Not bad, not amazing. Cruise comedy! The second guy, Louis Ramey, I know I‚Äôve seen either on TV or perhaps at the Comedy Cellar in NYC. He was pretty funny I thought. The first guy w the high voice and Trump impression I found funny but somewhat grating (mainly his laughing at himself).

Bionic Bar- Fun doing once. I‚Äôd hate to be the worker that has to sit and maintain it all day. Much prefer the Champagne bar on Allure. 

Elevators ‚Äì Ugh.	

Covid protocols ‚Äì Washy Washy! 3 of our 6 travelers came down with covid, including myself the last morning on the ship. Maybe 2-5% of people wore masks ever. I didn‚Äôt, and neither did my party , but I really don‚Äôt think masks would have made a difference with this current strain and how often you‚Äôd have to wear on to stay protected. On the last night of the cruise, I noticed a LOT of dinner room service trays waiting to be picked up. To me this seemed like a clear sign of people isolated due to covid. My friend tested positive himself on Fri morning, went to the medic and they did a half-assed swap of his nose, declared him negative and sent him on his way. He kept himself isolated but if he‚Äôd wanted to he could have ridden the elevators up and down all day. This was fairly concerning I‚Äôd say. 


Main Dining Room ‚Äì This was the biggest sore point early in the cruise, however I‚Äôll say upfront that they rectified things quickly and very much to our satisfaction. The issue was that our group of 6 was seated in MDR3, in the far back/inside corner. Behind a wall and under a low ceiling, and next to a group of probably 15-20 at another table. The noise from the other family was unbearable, simply because of the low ceiling and corner causing it to echo and drown out everything else. No blame to them, they‚Äôre just having a great time. But also, both of our servers were pretty terrible and seemed lost. Drinks were wrong, or given to wrong person. Same with the food.  However, after the second night we spoke to the AsstMD and he immediately found us a fantastic new table on 5, and our servers there were outstanding. 


Foodwise, I‚Äôm a fan of the MDR food and this cruise I was not disappointed (mostly). I would say my favorite main dish was the Chicken Cordon Bleu and the kid‚Äôs menu banana split (yum). The lambchops were also terrific.


The worst thing I ate was the Beef Stroganoff on night two. They did something weird with it, using some kind of fish or shrimp sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce and it was FOUL. I almost threw up tbh. I didn‚Äôt complain or send it back, thinking there was an off-chance that I didn‚Äôt know what stroganoff was supposed to taste like (except that I very much do!). I‚Äôd like to know what happened there though. I think they may have used HP sauce by mistake.


Also, Johnny Rockets was a disaster on Friday. Not only have they doubled the price of what you pay for their menu,  it‚Äôs hardly ever open (used to be a great place for a late night snack), and the service and food we received was so poor we had to complain and ask for a refund, which we received. The burger was‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what it was, but it was basically a giant hunk of grey meat that hadn‚Äôt been pressed down onto the grill to flatten it out. Instead of ketchup, they brought out fries with a bowl of bbq sauce. JR‚Äôs was one of my favorite things to look forward to on previous sailings, so I hope they get it straightened out.


Playmakers had GREAT late night food. Their cheese fries and chicken tenders were just fantastic. 


Ports! 


Cococay was fun and relaxing. I was there before the reno and it‚Äôs night and day. I was really into the various food options they had available. The philly cheesesteak was pretty great. 


Cozumel we did a dolphin swim and I was very impressed with the facility and the staff, and we had a wonderful time w/ the two dolphin we got to spend time with. 


In Roatan we went to Daniel Johnson‚Äôs monkey/sloth place, which required us to find our driver outside the port and deal with Honduran traffic jams‚Ä¶ which, ooooof. But we got there and the place itself was a lot of fun. They lock you in a cage with a bunch of monkeys and they pretty much just jump and climb and explore all over you (one went down the back of my shirt). It was CHAOS. But the best kind. I think every cruise should include a port that feels a bit dangerous. 


In Costa Maya we did a Mayan ruins tour that involved an hour-long bus ride each way, but was worth the trip as the ruins were absolutely stunning. Also saw quite a lot of local wildlife, between butterflies, birds, basilisk lizards, and a tree next to one pyramid that was FULL of spider monkeys looking for food. What a treat that was to see.  


The last thing I‚Äôll comment on is the overall crowd on the ship. On past sailings my wife and I had no trouble finding fun, like-minded (liberal) folks to get to know and we‚Äôve made some close friends this way. All I can say is that we‚Äôre clearly in the minority of such people going on cruises these days (which makes sense obviously). There were definitely some cringey/bothersome moments involving rude travelers. One example - an elderly lady commented on my daughter, who was wearing an Israeli Coca-Cola shirt, which is in Hebrew, as ‚Äúthat girl in the A-Rab shirt‚Äù and one old dude walked around w/ his MAGA hat on the entire time.

The job fits perfectly my field, and the salary is very good compared to my current portuguese salary.

I  know that the companies are still struggling to fill the ships due to the huge visa backlog in some countries (i.e. Philippines) and to the people who are not coming back after the lockdowns. During the  interviews we have also talked about career perspectives inside of the  company.

Cruise,"Hi everyone! I want to start by saying that I love cruising and have been on 8 cruises total with a 9th scheduled for later this year. I have also worked in the cruise industry since 2014. 

My very first cruise ever was on Royal Caribbean (2006 - Monarch of the Seas), and I also sailed with them in 2011 aboard Mariner of the Seas. I remember enjoying my time, and always looking forward to the food. Whenever people would ask about the best aspects of a cruise, cruise food was always one of the first things I would bring up. 

More recently, I have sailed twice with Princess, and twice with Viking, with my upcoming voyage also being booked with Viking. This past June, however, I felt like sailing out of LA in the summer and bringing my mom. I booked a 4 night, R/T LA voyage aboard Navigator of the Seas, stopping In Ensenada Mexico and Catalina island. This trip was very nostalgic for me as, on my first cruise ever, we sailed the same itinerary on the same cruise line. 

The ship was fairly nice. Navigator has been recently ‚Äòamplified‚Äô so most of the public spaces felt fresh and modern. You definitely wouldn‚Äôt guess that you were on a 20 year old ship from the look of her. Our cabin was a bit dingy and dated, but I was happy to overlook that. 

What was really bad, though, was the food. We did not dine in any of the extra $$ restaurants and instead oped for the included fare (MDR, Windjammers, el loco fresh and others). From the first meal onboard, it was clear that the food on Royal, at least on this voyage, had taken a big dive in quality. 

Here are a few of the lowlights:

1: I ordered Chicken Parmesan in the main dining room one night and was brought what can only be described as a pre cooked, pre breaded Tyson Chicken breast atop some spaghetti with a can of diced tomatoes and cheese over the top

2: I ordered what was called a ‚ÄòTraditional English Trifold‚Äô for dessert one night and was brought a mixture of canned whipped cream and jello in a plastic cup

3: In the buffet one day, they had a whole roasted pig (one of my favorites), so I got some. I honestly believe that the meat had gone rancid.The other person in my group who also had it agreed

5: I went to el loco fresh about 5 minutes after they opened and was presented with cold meat and stale tortillas. I learned to stay clear of the pre made burritos

6: this is more of a service complaint, but one night we had to ask 4 different members of the waitstaff in the MDR for drink orders before someone from a different section of the MDR finally came to take them.  

7: The bread and pastries appeared to have come onboard pre made but unbaked, and were simply thrown in the over prior to serving. 

Those are just a few examples, but just about every meal was on par with the above. 

Not everything was bad, and there were a few standouts. Not as good as I remember the food on Royal being before, but better than most the meals we had onboard:

1: I ordered the beef tenderloin on the first night in the MDR, and it seemed like a good quality piece of meat that was cooked exactly as I wanted it. 

2: the French onion soup available every night was very good, however it was not consistent night to night with both temperature and seasoning levels

3: all the speciality cocktails were very tasty. 

Honestly, after this experience, I don‚Äôt know if I would sail Royal Caribbean again. Especially when this voyage was the same price as a Princess cruise that was a day longer and included free wifi and a $30pp SBC (enough for one night in a speciality restaurant). It‚Äôs a shame as being on the west coast, I do not have a lot of options for local cruising. 

I really want to know if this is what I should just expect from Royal moving forward, or if maybe I just had a bad voyage.

EDIT:

I‚Äôm happy to hear from the comments that a lot of people have had much better food experiences onboard Royal ships. I also agree that food is a very subjective thing. I spoke with a few people on the cruise who had no issues at all with the food. 

A point that I failed to make clear in my original post is that I came into this cruise mainly comparing Royal Caribbean‚Äôs food to itself. The food from my early to late 2000‚Äôs voyages where the meals in the MDR were meals I‚Äôd happily pay $100+ for on land.",Was my Royal Caribbean experience typical (bad food),,Daehtop_Yrrah,,45,2022-07-23 19:41:12

Cruise,"Howdy all! 

I just disembarked the Symphony a few hours ago and I got. . Quite a long time until my flight tonight, so I thought I‚Äôd give my opinions on our cruise from the past week. These are all going to be my opinions about my time onboard. I have no major complaints about anything that happened onboard and the entire trip was a lot of fun and a good way to spend my last week or so before heading back to college this fall. If y‚Äôall have any comments or other questions, please feel free to let me know in the replies! Now, on to my review: 

**The Ship: 9.5/10**

The Symphony is by far one of my favorite ships I‚Äôve cruised on since I started in 2009. The ship was beautiful, had tons of things to do, had some great shows and events that happened, plenty of places to eat and drink, or to just sit down and play some cards. Don‚Äôt think I would have wanted any other ship for the voyage and it was helped by my cabin being a balcony overlooking the Central Park area. I never had any issues getting on slides, the zip line, or Ultimate Abyss and I never felt like there was a lot of people onboard. It was obvious there was a lot of people on port days, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad otherwise, and my family never had to fight to get seats in shows or anything. I only take off 0.5 points thanks to me still being more of a fan of the Freedom class of ships.

**Food: 9/10**

I never have any complaints onboard RCL ships and this was no exception. The food was excellent, especially in the dining room, with the small changes to the menu every night. The wait staff, who I‚Äôll get more into later, we‚Äôre excellent and they made sure we had everything we needed. The food in Windjammer was repetitive for lunch and breakfast, which I expected after having last traveled on Anthem in 2019, but I still wish that there was a bit more variety for the food in the restaurant from time to time. The other places onboard that offered ‚Äúquick service‚Äù type food, like Serentos and the Mexican restaurant, were also excellent and I have no complaints otherwise. 

**Service: 10/10**

I‚Äôve come to think that RCL has some of the best staff I can find on a cruise ship. They are always really kind and attentive to the people around them and what needs they may need. They all were very helpful and accommodating across the ship, especially when I know how hard they work and for such little pay, but the waiters we had in the dining room were some of the best I‚Äôve had aboard a RCL cruise, only outmatched by the waitstaff we had aboard the Liberty out of Galveston in 2016, who I remember because they were so nice and worked hard, but also were ‚ÄúRicky and Bobby‚Äù which allowed them to make some fun jokes. The rest of the crew, including our cabin attendant, were also really awesome and I was very happy with the hard work they all put in. Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with the experience they provided.

**Ports: 9/10**

I have no real gripes with any of the ports of call we visited, being Cozumel, Roatan, Puerto Costa Maya, and CocoCay. The ports were all fun to visit and the different shops were interesting to look at and visit, with my only big gripe about them being the people in Puerto Costa Maya being really ‚Äúin your face‚Äù about their stuff, which I completely get, they don‚Äôt make a whole lot of money as is and the cruises definitely help business. Now, on to the excursions. 

**Excursions: 9/10**

The sloth excursion we had, Daniel Johnson's Monkey and Sloth Hang Out, on Roatan was my favorite excursion of the trip. Getting to see these sloths and other animals up close was so awesome and the snorkeling we did after at a reef out a few minutes from the sloths was also a lot of fun. I also was able to meet the guy who runs it, Daniel Johnson, because he drove our boat out for snorkeling. Real fun guy and he obviously cared about the animals and helping every learn about them and to have a fun time. Would highly recommend if you ever go to Roatan, Honduras! 

We had a small excursion in Puerto Costa Maya, Mexcio, which was to walk the aviary above the shops in the port area. Was a lot of fun and the ducks stole all my bird seed in the second or third room. Still fun, cool people who run the experience.

Our excursion out of Cozumel was a Mayan Ruin adventure out to Tulum, which wasn‚Äôt too bad. The bus ride was about an hour out to Tulum, with a 45 minute ferry ride to the mainland. The Mayan Ruins were a lot of fun to learn about and explore, although I would have loved to climb them, we obviously can‚Äôt due to preservation purposes. My big gripes about this experience was the stop at a Glass Making factory with free tequila tasting. No big issue with seeing the glass making part, but this was one of two ‚Äúshopping‚Äù stops which lasted over thirty minutes, when I just wanted to head back to the ship. The other shopping stop was out towards the ferry port area and lasted another forty minutes, being all ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù type shops which I didn‚Äôt enjoy. 

All in all, not terrible ports or excursions, but if I had the choice, I‚Äôd want the Mayan Ruins in Tulum just to be the Mayan Ruins and the option to explore the shops after if you‚Äôd like. 

**Entertainment: 10/10**

Absolutely no complaints here. We saw quite a few comedy shows onboard which I enjoyed, a few of the ice skating shows, the main one being 1977, and of course the two ‚ÄúBroadway‚Äù type productions of Hairspray and Flight: Dare to Dream. All the performers were excellent and they put on some really good productions onboard. We also saw the water shows at the Aquatheater, being the Hiro show, which was also really cool, but had to be delayed two days due to lightning at sea our second night. Great shows, great performers, and some of the best shows I‚Äôve seen at sea. If you sail on the Symphony in the future, I‚Äôd highly recommend all of the shows onboard.

**Overall Rating: 9/10**

I loved everything onboard and, despite some small things I didn‚Äôt like, I would say this was one of my favorite cruises I‚Äôve taken recently. I would definitely sail this ship again in the future, although I‚Äôd try to do an Eastern Caribbean cruise itinerary, instead of Western, or find a different area to explore. Overall? It was a lot of fun and I‚Äôd highly recommend it to anyone thinking on sailing with RCL on one of their ‚Äúnewer‚Äù vessels.",My review of the Symphony of the Seas Western Itinerary,,ScallywagBeowulf,,18,2022-07-23 16:10:49
Cruise,"All of my prior cruises were on carnival, and I wanted to try something different so we booked a cruise for September on Royal Caribbean.

We booked two rooms, one for myself and my girlfriend, one for her adult child.

A couple weekends I was provided access to the Royal up program. From reading on their website you don't normally get access to it until a month before your cruise (again, our cruise is in September so we are more than a month out). How common is this?

If we were given access to Royal up 2 months before our cruise, do they do this in phases? Will we hear if we got an upgrade about the same time they open the program up to everybody else? I guess I'm wondering if they're trying to upgrade me out of the junior suite, so they can offer my junior suite to people with lower level rooms.

I put bids in on three rooms, all of them a little over minimum. From your experience with the program, how likely are we to get upgraded? Have people tried to royal up and not been upgraded?

And last comment/question, even though I booked both rooms, paid both deposits, paid both balances, our junior suite was the only one that was offered the Royal program early. I tried to go to the web page for the program to put bids in for the other room (interior room across the hall from our junior suite) and it said it is not available yet. Do they offer royal up early based on the rooms to we reserved already?

Cruise,"I am currently on day nine of a ten day cruise around the Mediterranean on the Celebrity Reflection. It has been beautiful so far, but around day 6 you could start to tell people were getting sick. Every day more and more people are coughing, and now it is practically impossible to find a table at a restaurant or a deck chair without someone hacking away right next to you. And the worst part is, most people will barely cover their cough or not at all. I understand not wanting to get tested by the cruise line and then being unable to leave a tiny cabin for the rest of the vacation. But I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs so difficult for people to do a better job of preventing the spread of the illness they have. Even before covid, this was common sense. Cruising doesn‚Äôt seem worth it once you realize you will likely test positive at the end of the trip unless completely avoiding all people (which is practically impossible on a cruise).

Cruise,"Howdy all!

Hope all of you are well, I wanted to ask y‚Äôall about some of your favorite pier runners stories, or the people who get back to the ship late at a port of call. 

I can‚Äôt remember any too spectacular off the top of my head, even with seven cruises under my belt now, but I was a part of one on my cruise from July 16th on the Symphony of the Seas. 

What had happened is that we were out in Cozumel and had to take a ‚Äúfast‚Äù ferry to and from the cruise dock. The ride lasts about 45 minutes or so, which isn‚Äôt terrible, but I still didn‚Äôt like doing it. Regardless, we were booked on an RCL excursion, which I‚Äôll go into more tomorrow when I give my final overview of the cruise, and we got back to the ferry with about an hour or so to spare. The ferry got back back to the dock only about five minutes before the scheduled departure and the entire ferry was going through security about fifteen minutes after docking. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, as we were underway only about 35-40 minutes late, but it still wasn‚Äôt great and I‚Äôm glad it was an RCL excursion.

Cruise,"Here is Part 2 of my review of **7 Day Greek Isles cruise on Norwegian Jade**. July 10-17.

Part 1 was posted already and covers the ports of Athens Piraeus, Kudasai Turkey, Patmos (cancelled), Rhodes, Mykonos, Argostoli, Corfu, and Santorini.

**Pool and amenities 8/10**

I don‚Äôt think this ship has as many amenities as some other ships but it is my first cruise in a long time so I don‚Äôt have much to compare it to. But I know of other big ships that have ziplines, waterslides, etc. so I will rate it an 8 even though I thought it was perfectly fine. I expect since this is a busy cruise with lots of stops it doesn‚Äôt need as many amenities. The upper decks had a fitness center, basketball/tennis/soccer court, small running track, sundeck and pool area. Ping pong by the pool. There was a shuffle board on the side of deck 7. The pool deck had two pools that weren‚Äôt very large and each had two hot tubs. One pool and set of hot tubs were supposed to be adults only. I saw kids in the adult hot tubs on occasion and the day I went swimming in the adult pool some kids started jumping in and life guard told them it was adults only and made them go to the other pool. I don‚Äôt think there were that many kids on the ship so I wasn‚Äôt bothered by them in the pool area generally as long as they were out of the adult pool. The adult pool was deeper and was salt water. It was fun because it was so easy to float in. The most desirable lounge chairs could fill up quickly but there were enough in total. If we had an at sea day I could see chair availability being a problem, especially since we were only at maybe 60% capacity. They kept the pools clean. I think the pools closed at a certain time at night for cleaning but the hot tubs stayed open later and people enjoyed the in the evening hours. I also noticed a spa, small arcade, kids club and casino. The casino looked nice and clean but I never saw people gambling in it.

**Room - inside**

Not rating the room because it was an inside cabin so it was small and as to be expected. Nothing wrong with it. Enough outlets, good closet and drawer space. Working safe. Bathroom was small by the toilet which was angled but roomy enough by the sink and actually surprisingly decent room in the shower in both height and surrounding area. I didn‚Äôt watch tv but it appeared to have decent channels and newer movies like Batman.

**Service 10/10**

The service made our trip. We felt like valued guests. Everyone we interacted with was friendly and helpful. Employees we interacted with regularly would say hi and talk with us. A drink server was fast even though working nearly the entire room and remembered our drink preferences. We ate at the free Alizar restaurant/dining room for most dinners. They gave us the same server all but one night and then the one night he wasn‚Äôt with us he still stopped by. The manager always stopped by and welcomed us back as did other staff members. They gave us friendly goodbyes and said they would see us tomorrow. It felt like we were eating in fancy restaurant with top notch service. On our last buffet breakfast the Alizar dinner restaurant staff were stationed at the buffet since it was so busy and they said hi and talked with us at the buffet. 

Our room attendant was great. The room was cleaned perfectly 2x per day. He always said hi to us by name in the hallway and asked us if we needed anything. 

It was spouse‚Äôs bday so they gave him a card and said we could get a free cake. We didn‚Äôt get the cake because we were more interested in other desserts. No d√©cor on the door; I guess that is an old school cruising thing and isn‚Äôt done anymore?

**Entertainment and activities 10/10**

There were a lot of options for entertainment and activities every day. Activities included shuffleboard and ping pong tournaments; dance lessons; 2 per day basic fitness classes along the lines of stretching class (yoga, Pilates, etc. were upcharges); trivia multiple times per day; and more. You could get an activity stamp/punch card and then redeem it for prizes like NCL branded playing cards, pens, etc. at the end of the cruise. 

They usually had a game show every night like newlywed game and they had a big show in the theater every night. Shows were good quality and included music, acrobatics, magician. I went to most of the shows and enjoyed them. Shout out to the NCL orchestra, they were great in the background of the shows.

They also had DJs, bands and piano players at 3 different locations (smaller piano lounge area, medium size club area, and larger Spinnaker lounge/club) plus the pool. 

I couldn‚Äôt do all the activities/music I wanted to since there were so many.

The night theme parties in the Spinnaker lounge were a bit so so and kind of tame. They started early enough that teens could participate and the small group that attended actually helped get the parties started. I went to a 80s party and white/neon/glow party. While kind of fun the tameness of those was a marked contrast to the smaller club having a guy sing Freddie Mercury and it was standing room only with people dancing on the tables. Also a marked contrast to my vague memories of my other Greek Islands cruise where they had a Greek party with guests VERY into it. Guests took the opportunity to wear dresses and clothing they bought in ports; there was lively Greek music and circle dancing; a rowdy competition for Mr. Greek God/Zeus and other stuff that made it a really fun party night on that ship.

I didn‚Äôt say up late enough to comment on any late night partying/action.

**Drinks 10/10**

We are not big alcohol drinkers and I rarely drink soda so I was on the fence about paying almost $300 in gratuities for both of us to have the free at sea drink package. We decided to do it and have it add to our vacation fun. It was fun! There were so many drinks to choose from and different bars on the ship. Over 10 wines; frozen drinks of course; a mojito bar with yummy fresh mint; a martini bar; Irish coffee made with Jameson. We got our money‚Äôs worth and enjoyed the variety. With the free at sea it was a good value.

Any issues I had with drinks like the upcharge for fresh juice were probably actually food issues as I think some fresh juice should just be included at breakfast.

**Food 7/10**

Food was good but not excellent.

Even though the gratuity upcharge for free at sea specialty dining was only like $20 or something I declined it because I was more interested in trying the standard dining to see how it was on NCL and not worry about reservations so I can‚Äôt comment on any specialty dining. 

Free dining included the buffet, some restaurants, MDR and Alizar restaurant with same menu as MDR.

We used the **buffet** and associated areas for breakfast and lunch every day. The variety was good. Breakfast had everything you would expect from a standard breakfast buffet including omelet stations. Lots of pastries. Ok fruit selection, no berries or kiwi. The plain French toast was good but they changed it up each day and raisin French toast day was not so good. They also changed up the sticky bun every day and when it was pecan sticky bun day they were generous with the pecans. I think they also had pecans by the oatmeal but I‚Äôm not sure because I didn‚Äôt really go to that area. Apple sticky bun day looked like canned apples on top. Biggest negative for me was included drinks. No fresh juice. Drinks from the dispenser were made from some kind of concentrate and the orange juice looked like Minute Maid or Sunny D and the iced tea was also in the dispenser from concentrate. But they did have 6-10 different tea bags and milk so I was satisfied for breakfast. When I felt like something more than regular tea I would do a makeshift London Fog by mixing honey into my Earl Grey and then adding hot milk from the buffet. I can understand that Starbucks is not included in the standard drink plan or the regular food package because it would be a lot of labor to make some those drinks. But I was happy getting a drink plan that included Irish coffee at the bar (not sure if it is at all bars but the Irish bar has it) when I felt like a fancier coffee drink.

Lunch variety at the buffet was really good. They had a lot of meat options. Highlights were the little meatballs in red sauce (may have been Greek style); fish; pork and chicken done in a few different styles; Greek Pasitsio one day. I think they had Asian options most days. A nice sandwich/panini variety. My spouse hates Indian food but I like to try it so I took the opportunity to get a little bit of that most days at lunch for added variety. Vegetable quality was good. Late lunch outside was also good and included a different quiche, two different cookies (good but not great) and scone each day. They had whipped cream instead of clotted cream but I still enjoyed the scones.

We went to the dinner buffet twice. It was not the best but if you wanted a quick dinner it was fine since there was variety. One night was prime rib night. Do not get the buffet prime rib. It was bad. Greek night was yummy. Dinner had crepes made to order each night with a choice of canned cherries or canned apples for filling and whipped cream. Lunch and dinner had several nice desserts to choose from. 

We opted for the **Alizar** restaurant for dinner most nights. Same menu as MDR but more intimate feel and more convenient to our room location. Fish, lamb, pork and short rib ragout entrees were great but the night I opted for steak it wasn't good and had a weird consistency like maybe it was pressure cooked or something. Based on buffet experience we didn‚Äôt try the prime rib. Sides were usually really good including some excellent asparagus. But sides weren‚Äôt overly fancy. Like I don‚Äôt think they had au gratin potatoes but they had mashed. 10 of 12 appetizers were great and all desserts were good but we never saw cr√®me Brule offered and that would have been nice. Maybe it was offered a night we didn‚Äôt eat there? Ice cream flavors were basically just chocolate and vanilla. I could have done with some better ice cream options on the ship. Service was excellent at Alizar as described above.

**NCL BOGO air and total trip price 9/10‚Äì a (rare?) success story from US to Athens**

I have read a lot of posts saying not to do it and other people have had issues so you may want to proceed with caution if thinking of booking air through NCL. But for me it worked great and was the entire reason we took this cruise. 60 days out we knew we wanted to be in Athens on July 9 for a wedding. We were planning to combine a stop in Athens with a vacation to somewhere else in Europe because once you get from the US to Europe adding flights within Europe is typically reasonable price wise. And I had already been on a Greek Islands cruise years ago so I wasn‚Äôt planning to repeat that. Because we had a target price for the entire vacation of around $5,000 or less this turned out to be a challenge. Flights from the US to Athens (or Europe in general) were expensive and didn‚Äôt have great options. We need at least one connection because we aren‚Äôt in a major US airline city but want to avoid multiple connections. The best option we found on our own flying to Athens was connecting in Canada and flight times were only ok. This would cost a minimum of $3,000 for both of us and not leave a lot left over for a 7-10 day vacation. As a last ditch effort I checked vacations to go (used for research not for booking) for cruises out of Athens around the date of the wedding. That is how I found the NCL cruise departing Athens on July 10, the day after the wedding with a price of $799. I also noticed the BOGO airfare. I called NCL to ask about it and it was using NCL group air to book both of our airfares for a total price of $1,500. We got the air and 7 day cruise (inside room) for a total price of $3,580 including service charges, taxes, etc. In our minds the cruise was costing us only $580. It was the deal we were looking for based on our budget, schedule and desire to take a vacation in Europe. Total price increased a little when we ended up adding the free at sea drink package and trip insurance but we did the entire trip with extra time in Athens, excursions, transfers, etc. within budget.

Booking NCL air worked out great but made us VERY nervous. I may have a few extra gray hairs now. For the deal we were getting we decided to take a gamble and accept the nervousness. The NCL sales guy that was explaining BOGO air to us was a cruise sales guy and not knowledgeable about air. We said we need to arrive early for the wedding. We want to arrive on July 7 or 8. He said you can do up to a two day deviation and indicated that would mean departing the US on the 8th. This was incorrect information. Flights from US to Europe take two days because of the overnight. But he had us thinking all the way up until we got our assigned flights that with the two day early deviation we put in for we would actually arrive on July 9th if we left on the 8th. We were supposed to get flights confirmed 45 days out but they emailed and said because of airline volatility and cancellations it would be more like 30 days out. We anxiously waited. June 13 we finally found some flight info (cities/connections but not times) in our online account and 11:43PM June 14th it was emailed to us. The flights arrived in Athens early on the 8th! And they were better than what we were finding on our own! Reasonable departure times, reasonable connection times and one connection each way in major US cities. Flying out on Delta and back on American. Trip completed with no issues. 

**Overall 9.5/10**

We had a great time and really enjoyed the service and value. My Part 1 review covers the 7 (not 8 because Patmos was cancelled) ports and those are in my opinion the reason to go on this trip. We enjoyed seeing so many beautiful places. We also enjoyed the freestyle aspect of eating when and where we wanted. This was probably made even more enjoyable (and the cruise overall) by the fact that the ship may have only been at 60% capacity. If you are interested in the ports and NCL pricing fits your budget you should consider this cruise.",Review part 2: 7 day Greek Isles cruise on Norwegian Jade,,1Frazier,,0,2022-07-22 19:40:06

We are first time cruisers sailing through NCL out of Orlando in mid August. We are excited to begin our vacation, but have concerns with getting to the port on time!

Cruise,"I‚Äôm currently on my first night for a Mediterranean cruise at the moment and my fianc√© has fallen in love with it. I am 26 and she is 25. 

I have sailed 3 times total, Celebrity twice (including my current trip) and Azamara once. 

Things important to me are the destinations, the food, and relaxation (the less kids the better). 

I love the friendliness of the Celebrity staff and my Azamara cruise was out of this world regarding the level of service provided. I appreciate the always included amazing meals and complimentary drink packages as well. I thought these cruises were a good deal until I saw some price points on some others. 

However, I just had some of the most deliciously tender prime rib of my life paired with an incredible Cabernet with cr√®me br√ªl√©e for dessert at no charge. Is this normal with other cruise lines regarding quality of meals at no additional charge?

Any recommended cruise lines for someone with our interests? 

Celebrity is offering $500 on board credit for the next cruise I book, but to be honest I‚Äôve never spent a penny more than my original fare in the past so far.

I don‚Äôt think the loyalty is very much worth it regarding the Celebrity line. It‚Äôs the other things that add up for me. Naturally I‚Äôd always like to save some money but I don‚Äôt want it to be at the cost of the quality for what I‚Äôve experienced so far. 

Destinations for December/January would ideally be some place warm and sunny. Currently looking at South America. Neither of us have been to the Bahamas either. If we‚Äôre going to be paying for flights we might as well make them worth it and and spread the cost over a 9-12 night cruise.",Finding a warm getaway cruise with my fianc√© in December/January,,Bezdbefazed,,11,2022-07-22 01:45:11

Cruise,"Took an unplanned cruise at the beginning of July with my spouse because the price was right and had a great time seeing the Greek Islands. I have taken three cruises before this one (with one being to the Greek Islands) but those cruises were so long ago that I don‚Äôt think they are a valid point of comparison for most points. I consider myself getting reacquainted with cruising.

Here is Part 1 of my review of **7 Day Greek Isles cruise on Norwegian Jade**.

Since it will get long I‚Äôll just include Ports, Excursions and Embark in Part 1.

**Ports and Excursions and embark**:

**Day 1 Athens Piraeus** ‚Äì no excursions offered through NCL prior to departure and on the return our flight was too early to schedule anything. Ended up looking at the Acropolis on my own the day before departure (highly recommend) and doing the big red bus hop on hop off tour to see more places (also recommend).

Transfer was not purchased because we arrived two days early and I was confident in easily getting to the airport. It turns out the red bus tickets are all valid for 48 hours. They have an add on Piraeus line for about 5 euro that will take you from the Acropolis stop. The morning of departure we got on the red bus by our hotel (Plaka area) and got off at Acropolis to transfer to Piraeus bus. A little extra time was involved making sure we got there early but the view of the Acropolis while we waited was nice; there was some narration of stops on the way; and I don‚Äôt think we could beat a 10 euro trip to the port. Note they have room for luggage on the red bus.

**Embark**

This was the worst part of the trip. Took almost 4 hours even though we were scheduled at a time. Shade not provided for all of the waiting. I have no idea why it took so long but I did notice the last stop was passport check and they only had one person doing this for everyone so it definitely backed up at everything included in that station (baggage scan, etc).

**Day 2 Kudasai Turkey**. We were also supposed to have a second stop in evening stop at **Patmos** but that was cancelled a few weeks in advance without explanation. This was a bummer because I went there before and really enjoyed it for its beauty and learning about the religious history of the area. But 8 ports in 7 days is a lot so we made the best of our free evening.

Kudasai has Ephesus and it may be the best ruins site I have ever been too. It is big and had a lot unearthed. I could really feel what it was like to walk through that ancient town. It is hot here so I brought a sports drink and an umbrella for shade but the guide did a good job of finding shady areas to stop and narrate so we weren‚Äôt in the sun the entire time.

The Ephesus excursions through NCL are priced low enough you should get one free with the NCL free at sea credit.

**Day 3 Rhodes**. I had been here before so I didn‚Äôt do an excursion. There are nice streets to walk around for shopping and cafes. And I think this location is a bit unique compared to other stops because you can easily see some historic forts and stuff by walking around on your own.

**Day 4 Mykonos**. Another place to walk around, shop, caf√© and people watch. Picturesque with the white and blue. Spouse was interested in history so we did the excursion to take the small boat to the island of Delos. The island has no people on it just the ruins. The ruins were interesting but on this trip I would rate them 3 of 3. Not as complete as other locations and the famous statues are actually reproductions. But if you like ruins and don‚Äôt want to shop/caf√© or beach all day then worth doing. It was hot be we went early. Also a bit breezy.

**Day 5 Argostoli**. We aren‚Äôt big shopper/beach people so we wanted to do an excursion. There were only 4 to choose from offered by NCL. We did the monastery and winery. It was ok. It was only $49 each so we got one free with the free at sea credit. The lady at the winery was rude and I didn‚Äôt like the wines that much but they were pretty cheap to buy.

**Day 6 Corfu**. Corfu was a pleasant surprise. There is a lot to do here. They get a lot of rain so it was very lush and scenic. Our excursion was a scenic drive (really enjoyed it) that also described major sites and stopped at the Koum Kouat distillery. The distillery may be a tourist trap but I really enjoyed it. They let us sample a lot of drinks and foods and they were all good. Prices were reasonable for buying. Apparently the kumquat is unique to Corfu so I had actually never encountered this fruit before.

**Day 7 Santorini**. We had to tender and make our way up either via walking up tons of steps, donkey or cable car. Very windy. My second time here and not really my favorite of the islands but unique volcano landscape/scenery. Lots of shopping and cafes. Spouse wanted to see ruins so we did the Ancient Akrotiri and wine tasting excursion. The Akrotiri ruins are very interesting and come from a volcano eruption 3,600 years ago. They are in a structure so it wasn‚Äôt as hot with the sun off of us. If you like ruins I definitely recommend it. The winery had a great view, nice bathrooms, gave us nice snacks with our 3 wines tasting and I liked the wine. It was more expensive than the other place but since I liked the wine it was worth it to me to pay more.

Not all tours included water. Specifically Ephesus and Delos, the hottest places. I was prepared with my own water but ran out during the Ephesus tour. Luckily spouse bought an extra large bottle on the way in.

Edit to add: The ports are the reason to do this cruise especially if you like a more active itinerary. You see so much in the 7 days with a good variety of scenery and things to do at each stop. I thought it was an excellent itinerary!",Review part 1: 7 day Greek Isles cruise on Norwegian Jade - ports and excursions,,1Frazier,,6,2022-07-21 21:33:09

Cruise,"After doing research for last few days, few things are clear in our minds:

Glacier Bay is a must have

Doing one-way to get more time everywhere

Balcony is a big plus for Alaksa cruises

Try for Starboard side for Northbound and Port Side for Southbound trips (or if we can get Aft facing that might be best?)

We have narrowed it down based on this to Princess Cruises (Grand and Sapphire), Holland America (Niew Amsterdam and Noordam) and Norwegian (Norwegian Jewel)

Now, I have mostly been looking at June dates, generally first half of June. But we are seeing some good deals for cruises that start end of May and finish in June.

For example, Norwegian Jewel has NB from 29th May to 5th June while Sapphire Princess has NB from 31st May to 7th June (arriving at 12:30am though wow), Holland America Noordam NB from 28th May to 4th June.

**Would there be any issues with such a last 2-3 days of May + 1st week of June itinerary? I read that some excursions are closed in May, but wasn't sure if that is the case for these end dates?**

If this kind of itinerary is not an issue, then, from the 3, Sapphire Princess vs Holland America Noordam vs Norwegian Jewel - which one do people prefer?

We don't have any issues with the population of the ship, I know HA tends to be older cruisers but that's fine with us. HA does have aft rooms available which is a nice plus IMO.

Norwegian Jewel was just recently refurbished which means it should have more modern look/feel but we can't really find any recent images of the balcony rooms apart from their website.

Princess seems in middle of both.

Also, can we do a Prince William Sound tour from Seward or is it only available from Whittier?

Cruise,"Hey my fellow cruisers! 

I had my first NCL cruise last month through a land-based casino offer. Booked an Alaska trip which was pretty exciting. Started off as Jade and was Ruby by the end of the trip. I was able to get me and my guest's spa charges and other charges knocked off which was nice. Surprisingly hit a bunch of jackpots on the slots and got lucky with the tables. I was ""kicked"" out of the casino every night it was open (because they were shutting down for the night). 

My question is what sort of offers should I expect? I did call the CAS line and they offered me a Haven on the Prima for next year along with mentioning some of the ruby benefits. However, there was nothing regarding freeplay (if NCL even does that). 

Does CAS normally mail/email offers out similar to vegas or do I have to call to see what I can actually get? Trying to plan my next trip in the summer. I just wasn't sure if I should book now by calling the CAS agents or wait for an offer(if it even populates)

Cruise,"me and my partner are looking to book with princess for next year. we absolutely adore the traditional, relaxing cruise with the beautiful ‚Äòmodern-titanic‚Äô decor that princess offers. we are only early-20s but partying or big drinking isn‚Äôt our thing, so we found princess to be the perfect middle ground with a mix of all ages. including flights, hotel and princess plus we paid ¬£1300 each for a balcony room for 7 nights. this equals ¬£185 per night, which is still perfectly affordable but enters the top end of our holiday budget.

anyway, we wanted a princess cruise for next year but found that only enchanted princess is available in the mediterranean 2023. it‚Äôs much more expensive because it‚Äôs a new ship but it‚Äôs so similar to the regal, we‚Äôre struggling to justify the price. for 7 nights with plus, including flights, hotel and balcony it‚Äôs a huge ¬£1800. that‚Äôs ¬£250+ per night and it‚Äôs just ridiculously expensive for a week.

i‚Äôm curious as to what you‚Äôd do. we looked at other cruise lines but found that rc is just not our vibe. wayyy too vegas on water for us. norwegian is very pricey and expect you to pay ¬£500+ extra just for a window. nothing about them makes me say wow. celebrity looks promising but mainly offer their older ships in europe, which look very tired and not worth the price tag imo. their new ships are gorgeous though. in general, princess is the cruise line for us and we don‚Äôt really wanna go with any other line. everyone has their favourite. 

would you just hope a good sale comes along, would you stump up the extra and just live with it or would you skip 2023 entirely and hope 2024 offers something better? we have thought about december time and trying out the caribbean for some winter sun, on one of princesses modern but not latest ships. sorry for the long post! i just thought i‚Äôd give as much context so we can make the best decision from your answers. :)",What would you do?,,elvanse2711,,11,2022-07-20 21:22:15

Main dining room - screw all specialty dining and just go here. Food was perfect every meal. Staff nothing short of stellar.  

Ports - really nice. Roatan we had booked Daniel Johnson‚Äôs animal refuge.
Our guide from the port was this awesome young lady who ended up being our tour guide nearly The Whole day. My wife forgot to pack a swimsuit and wanted a hat for jr. After going to See the monkeys at the refuge she took us to the local mall and hung with my wife while she shopped. Was great, she also gave us a nice drive around the island and of course I tipped her super well. I‚Äôm now FB friends with her.
Belize/harvest caye is NCLs private island. Was fantastic. Nice water park for kids, great beaches and a giant fun pool. Aside from sunburn we had a great time.
Costa maya we just walked around the port and spent the day on the empty ship. Nice !
Cozumel - booked an excursion to Playa Mia. A nice little resort. They picked us up at the port and a 15 min bus ride had us there. Great buffet and super awesome staff. Kept my soda refilled and the attendant actually kept others from setting up near me. I chose a distant area with nobody else for 75ft for quietness. Sure enuf the ‚Äúnoisy family‚Äù chose the lounger right next to me (with literally 200 empty ones to choose from) the attendant bounces right over and said this area was reserved and helped them move away. Tipped him well also for looking out for me. I‚Äôd recommend Playa Mia to everyone.

Sea days weren‚Äôt great. The ship was about 80% capacity and I‚Äôd go out on deck around 7 am to try and claim a chair. Nope, staff would say it‚Äôs too early. Unless you sat in front of a chair until 9 am you weren‚Äôt getting shit.
My wife however would walk to empty lounges that just had sandals at the foot and take it over. Was never an issue. We only,spent 2 hours ish tho before jr got bored of the splash pad and wanted to do something else

Splash academy is for 4yo to 6 yo I think. Staff was great but there‚Äôs not much to do. Some Lego and a PlayStation. He got bored after 2 nights of an hour each.

Bars were a mix, the poolside bars had awesome staff. The others not so much. Drinks overall were so weak it was funny. My son thought my mudslide was a vanilla shake and down it all in 2 slurps. I don‚Äôt think there was any alcohol in it at all. My wife was trying every possible cocktail and most were ok but she never got a slight buzz.

Leaving the ship was smooth and the kept the lines moving very well. We had no checked baggage so it was a nice walk off.

However the asshats at NCL booked our return flight at 9:30 pm! So we had 12 hours to kill in Miami. Rented a Tesla and drove up to boca and palm beach to see friends. For people that didn‚Äôt have that option I could see that being a shitshow. 

Overall we had a nice trip but I do t think I‚Äôd do NCL again. Royal Carib is just another level above. We used to do carnival twice a year since the port was a 40 min drive and we‚Äôd go last minute to save $. Next up is princess in sept to Alaska.

Cruise,"Apparently the Skagway White Pass excursion is NOT what it used to be. It does not go to BC and the Yukon like it is supposed to because Trudeau apparently can't properly manage a border. Good thing I looked because it is NOT worth doing the extra stuff besides the train.

The train alone for three people would be $352 on NCL. If I did the ""Best of"" tour, the price is the same as it was when they had the best parts of the excursion that were removed, but literally with just a lunch at an old gold camp a few miles from the port, and then like one drink at a saloon literally a stone's throw from the port. Those extra two things would cost an ADDITIONAL $525. Who would pay that? I'd rather do a whole other excursion.

To clarify, I‚Äôm not criticizing the train ride. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm criticizing the higher priced one which they replaced the Canadian stuff with some garbage right by the ship that‚Äôs not worth that much money.

And what are the Karen's on this thread talking about!? Everyone has to be vaccinated to be there anyway. It's government incompetence in Canada which is why you can't cross the border up there.

Cruise,"Small group of us booked a 5-day itinerary on the NCL Joy to Bermuda in October and I had a few questions:

1.) Vibe Beach Club - is this worth it? We can buy in advance for $189 pp. I've heard some good things about this area on other ships, but I was wondering if it was worth it being in more of an offseason cruise and a 5-day itinerary. Also, I doubt it happens, but we put in for upgrades to the Haven. By happenstance, if we get those upgrades, I imagine we could then cancel the vibe passes right?

2.) Freestyle Dailies - I was able to find the Freestyle Dailies for my previous cruise, but that was a 7-day Caribbean one that already had a lot of preceding cruises for people to upload their Dailies from. Is this the first time the Joy will be doing 5 day cruises to Bermuda? I cannot seem to find any of the Freestyle Dailies for this itinerary. I'd like to see previous Dailies in advance to help plan out dinner reservations around the shows and other events. It worked out really well having them in advance previously because we knew the days and times of the shows and even when they were serving prime rib in the main dining rooms to plan dinner reservations around.

3.) Any other things a small group of adults might want to know about this itinerary, the ship, or Bermuda itself? One of the things we found odd was the best ferry route to the Tobacco Bay area on the island in October will only run on the days when our ship is not there. Think that will be adjusted? Otherwise, we were planning on other methods of transport to get to the area.

Cruise,"P&amp;O Cruises has updated their testing policy (effective July 24th) that you no longer need to provide proof of a negative covid test at embarkation. Instead, they ask that you take one (which does not need to be protected) and just declare in the terminal that you have tested negative. 

This is more in line with how illness in the past has been treated at embarkation in the past. Just you as the customer asserting that you are fit to travel. This still provides some legal coverage (I assume) to P&amp;O without burden to the customer.

Below is the link to their policy and a few tweets responding to customers' inquires on the policy:

""Hi Julie, guests will be asked to confirm a test has been taken, with a negative result, for them and each member of their party aged 5 years and over as part of their pre-boarding health declaration at the terminal. Once this has been confirmed guests will be allowed on board.""

""Hi Lee, provided the **test** type is in line with our requirements. All guests aged five years and over must use an antigen self-**test**. This **test** doesn‚Äôt need to be medically observed and over the counter COVID-19 lateral flow/antigen tests will be accepted.""

Cruise,"Just cruised the Mediterranean on the NCL escape. Buckle up! 

We booked NCL due to the outrageous promos, particularly very cheap suites and 2nd guest flies free. I shouldn‚Äôt have pulled the trigger on 2nd guest flies free, because at 1,800$ I could have booked 2 flights for less money direct to Rome. More on that later. 

**Ship** 8/10 
The ship itself was very nicely done inside. Having only sailed on the Caribbean princess before, the ship felt very modern in design and decor. I noticed most of the ship‚Äôs upper deck was taken by kids areas, water slides, zip lines etc. This line caters to families so it makes sense. However it sucked having to fight for a lounger every day, and not being successful 50% of the time. I was told the ship was only at 70% capacity and cannot fathom an extra 30% trying to fight for lounge chairs and all other amenities. It would honestly be too full at capacity. The dining rooms were neat and deck 8‚Äôs Waterfront was beautiful (if you could find a seat)! 

**Food** 9/10
No complaints here, ate in both the garden caf√© and a couple specialty restaurants. The sushi in the MDR wasn‚Äôt great, but there was a decent variety. Teppenyaki was a fun experience and the filet mignon was delicious. La Cucina was ok food wise, not busy at all. With the free speciality dining promos you would have thought these places would be packed. You never needed a reservation. 

**Service** 5/10 
Grab a seat, this will be ranty. The restaurant staff were attentive and some made the extra effort in the MDR to offer you juice or water while you were sitting. The teppenyaki staff were engaging and made it a fun experience. We were in a suite and for some reason had a different room attendant about halfway through. Unsure if he got sick or what happened. Our rooms were never done by the time we returned from our excursions and felt like we couldn‚Äôt nap or relax because we wanted our rooms done. Granted, I‚Äôm unsure what NCL‚Äôs staffing level is at. They offered us a free bag of laundry, lost it, took a day to find it (but thankfully found it). The spa staff incessantly try to upsell you and book you for the most expensive type of treatment even though you only asked for the cheaper option. For example, I asked for a traditional pedicure and was booked in for a more expensive type without my knowledge and had to tell the nail tech not to do the extra service. Felt so dishonest. They also shove products down your throat. I‚Äôd love to relax in the spa without being hounded to purchase 200$ miracle lavender oil pills that will ‚Äúcure‚Äù my acne while getting a pedicure. Staff didn‚Äôt enforce adult only areas and it was annoying to have kids screaming when they have the rest of the ship they can scream on (lollll). All staff were masked, but nobody else wore them. 

The NCL air and customer service staff honestly turned me off from NCL forever. They booked us flights with 2 layovers under 1.5 hrs and were unwilling to change it to give more wiggle room because we booked the 2nd guest flies free promo. When our first flight was delayed by 2 hours which would have caused us to miss all our connections, the NCL emergency flight staff told me I was SOL and to take it up with the airline to have them rebook me on flights that would make the ship. We were successful, but apparently that caused NCL to revoke our already paid transfers from port to ship. So we had to pay for transfers twice an were never refunded. Our flight back somehow had us on all standby tickets so it was absolutely nerve wracking to not know if we were getting a seat or not. How is it legal to give NCL money to book actual flights and they book you standby instead?! Customer service on the ship were unwilling to rebook our transfers and we had to pay the transfer in cash the morning of. That concerned me because I was told to claim the transfer for a refund but have no receipts. Honestly if you do choose NCL, don‚Äôt book air with them. It isn‚Äôt worth it. Yes we should have flown in earlier, but with limited cruise experience I didn‚Äôt know what I didn‚Äôt know. Getting to the ship and back home was so insanely stressful.

**ports** 10/10 
The itinerary is what sold me on the cruise. While they had to remove Corfu Greece for reasons unknown and substitute with Montenegro,it ended up being our favourite port. Highly recommend the Lake Skadar cruise as an excursion. It was so insanely picturesque, like Banff Alberta level. We were served a traditional meal and lots of delicious wine. The staff were knowledgeable and made the history portion of the tour interesting. We enjoyed Croatia and all the Italian ports as well. Only tip: plan water based excursions if you go in July or august as it is regularly 38 ¬∞C or above making the walking history tours very difficult. Or go in spring/fall! 

**Entertainment** 
I didn‚Äôt do enough to feel comfortable rating it. We went to a malevo show which was fantastic and one fun trivia game. We enjoyed what we did! 

Overall, I‚Äôm writing this sleep deprived and a little angry so may feel less negative later. The experience and memories were beyond nightmare travel are great. I will definitely cruise again, just maybe try to find a line that caters less to kids and will book my own flights!

Cruise," 

I hadn‚Äôt been on a cruise in 30 years and that was Carnival. I did a ton of research prior to this special 20th wedding anniversary Holland America Line Alaska cruise on the Koningsdam, and I thought I‚Äôd share my experience for those who might be interested in a fresh perspective. 

**Ship and facilities:** 9/10 Very little to complain about here. It felt like a giant floating 5-star hotel. Fit and finish of the room and public spaces and basically the whole experience felt premium and high end. There‚Äôs no zip line or water slides or other youth-oriented gimmicks but I‚Äôd have happily stayed another week, especially if we had more exciting ports to visit. More on that later. To nitpick, as this is the Internet, there were drains in both the shower and on our deck that were a MM or two higher than they ought to have been, and as such we had a bit more standing (swaying?) water than would have been optimal, but totally not a big deal. 

**Service and crew and restrictiveness:** 8/10 We departed from Vancouver and literally only that Canadian federal building was the only place where masks were required, although there were ‚Äòmasks recommended‚Äô signs in public spaces and 15-20% of the populace was masked up, apart from 100% of the staff who were masked at all times, even officers. In one of our Alaska ports there was a ‚ÄòCanada Post‚Äô which had strict mask signs and their staff wore masks, it was like a tiny bastion of Canadian pro-mask restrictiveness. The staff was racially split, nearly 50/50, Filipino and Indonesians, with the more customer-facing jobs occupied by the Filipinos. The Indians weren‚Äôt back yet, visa restrictions. All friendly and helpful, I think my ship had a max capacity of 2,600, but we had just under 2k and it was 95% staffed (ie. more than required given the customer count) with just under 1,000. Was the service worth the $15.50 per person per day? Yes it was, no problem paying that, and we left a bit more for our two room attendants, mainly because one of them would always greet me by my last name in the hallway. Clever kid. 

**Music and Entertainment**  
 I must split these up, as my scores are quite distinctive. When I say Entertainment, I mean apart from the 4-part Music Walk, so basically the educational talks and the Dance group and movie options. For that Entertainment, that‚Äôs the weak link, 5/10. Lots of in-room movies to watch and interesting/appropriate films in the Lido deck big screen. Movies were fine, although I really wish they‚Äôd had a ‚Äònew releases‚Äô category (they had them, but they were mixed with the other 500 movies) and also an IMDB rating would be the best, but while we had data in ports we‚Äôd bulk/evaluate movies and queue up what we wanted to watch. The dance group was a bit meh for me (I‚Äôm not a qualified critic or anything, but neither my wife nor I went for more than 1 show) and the lack of off-broadway stuff was disappointing.

The Music Walk was pretty great. My favorite was the Lincoln Center Stage which is classical music (solos, duos, trios, or the full quartet) but we also enjoyed the Billboard Onboard (dual grand pianos sometimes taking requests or doing decade themes). The Rolling Stone Rock Room band was good, although the choice of songs wasn‚Äôt the greatest for me. Finally the BB King Blues club was musically strong but somehow I only sat through one of their shows. Possibly because we tended to go to bed early (were coming off jet lag from Europe), no complaints, but when it came down to it we never went back. 8/10 overall on Music.

**Food**: 9/10 Hard to complain here, with tons of options. Lunch was obviously not the big focus, and that‚Äôs ok because MDR breakfast and dinner were both spectacular. Specialty restaurants were superior (paid, and worth it based on my two experiences). My only nitpick - and it‚Äôs a personal thing - is that the Asian food was mediocre and scanty. We live in Asia and after a few days were getting pretty bored with ‚Äòwhite food‚Äô - as good as it was. The Indian food was a mediocre approximation and while the ‚ÄòDistant Lands‚Äô had various themes nightly, most of it wasn‚Äôt super fresh, rather it was like the chinese/japanese food you get from a high-end grocery store. Better than a low-end grocery store, but not great. Never had the made-to-order stir fry, probably should have. Otherwise, MDR and the Buffet were generally excellent. Pizzas and burgers/hotdogs also terrific and convenient. I gained 5lbs (2.3kg) in a week, if that tells you anything. My wife and I would often order 3ish appetizers to split and 3 entrees (again, to split) so we could try more things and, you know, yolo. I think we probably had 8-9 of our meals at the Lido Market (buffet) which was overall good, but a bit confusing as some stations were on both sides, but not all.

The last thing I‚Äôll say about the food, we didn‚Äôt drink much, but the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô leader for me was the self-serve by the ounce Strongbows cider (also had a beer one tap that way) which enabled me to grab a $3 half glass (was $0.40 per ounce) which is an optimal amount for me to sip on while watching a concert or whatever. This was located at the downstairs Lido bar, just coming out from the port side lido market. 

**Alaska/Ports**: 8/10 The main reason the score is this high is because of the Glacier Bay National Park day. If you‚Äôre going to Alaska, prioritize getting a cruise (all HAL ships have this, afaik) that gets to go in (only 2 per day). I‚Äôm sure our appreciation of the actual ports of call would have been greater if we hadn‚Äôt had terrible weather (high 40s (9¬∞c) and rainy) every day. Seems May/June is the best weather in Alaska, we were there July 9-16 and never saw a bit of blue sky beyond our sail out day from Vancouver. We did the White Pass Railway out of Skagway, my wife feels it was worth it, I didn‚Äôt, although I liked it, I didn‚Äôt $140 each like it. Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, maybe the views (which were admitted gorgeous) weren‚Äôt as life-altering as they‚Äôd have been for other people. We liked the Tram gondola thing in Juneau, but over-priced imho. We also really enjoyed the Great Alaskan Lumberjack Show in Ketchikan, although it was 60% Pro Wrestling hype building, but thoroughly entertaining, I‚Äôm a little embarrassed to admit. 

Glacier Bay was fabulous, although it‚Äôs quite hard to get a real sense of the scale. Only when I used my binoculars to look more closely at the dark pixels I saw on some of the floating ice did I realize they were 300lbs harbor seals and the actual face of Margerie Glacier was 275 feet high! We saw many calvings and it was something I‚Äôll remember for the rest of my life, highlight of the trip if I had to distill it down. Really recommend good (not tiny) binoculars. We had one pair of each and ended up passing the good ones back and forth more (10x50 although 7-8x would have also been good). Glacier Bay was a 10/10 and the 3 ports we went to were more like 6s and 7s.

**In summary**, really like Holland America, would absolutely cruise them again, but not that eager to return to Alaska. Someone who‚Äôs spent less time in the Pacific NW would probably appreciate it even more than we did.",Just cruised Alaska on HAL's Koningsdam after 30y - my review,,nightfly13,,12,2022-07-20 03:32:30

I would have all passengers sign a special declaration saying that we are not doing pre cruise testing, we are not requiring masks for passengers and crew, we will not test a passenger during the cruise unless they have symptoms.  We will attempt to change port stops that may restrict the types of passengers allowed to visit the port.

Cruise,"Do you have any tips to lower risk of covid-19 while on a cruise?

My spouse and I are thinking of taking an Alaska cruise (and hopefully spending some time in the interior also). We are leaning toward going in 2023, but that has some flexibility.

We are leaning toward Holland America. I expect a small ship with much fewer people would have lower risk, but those might be outside our budget.

Are any cruise lines or ships safer than others? Such as with the rules, or more outdoor dining, what have you ... ?

EDIT: I should have been clear that we know what to do in general to avoid covid. For example, we wear an N95 mask religiously when we're in a building other than our home. We don't eat inside restaurants. We socialize with only one or two people at a time.

Cruise,"Hello!

My husband (28M) and I (25F) will be celebrating our 3 year anniversary in September. We are deciding between a cruise or all inclusive resort for 4-5 nights. 

The cruise would most likely be Royal Caribbean‚Äôs Freedom of the Seas to Nassau and Coco Cay. The total cost of this trip would be approximately $1,100. 

The all inclusive resort would be Excellence Rivera Cancun in Mexico. The total cost of this trip would be approximately $1,900. 

We went to a sister AI resort in the DR last year and had an amazing time. Among other things, my husband loved the relaxing vibe and lack of children. 

I have been on 3 cruises, but my husband has not been on any. The 3 I have been on were Carnival cruises between the ages of 14-19. I remember it being pretty crowded (long lines for restaurants, packed pool, etc.), but I could be remembering incorrectly. Is this pretty typical?

Cruise,"We travelled to Rome from Birmingham (UK) yesterday.

Flights booked as part of the package with iglu
Birmingham to Munich
Munich to Rome.

Both flights with Lufthansa

The flight out of Birmingham was delayed due to the ground crew not loading the luggage in time. We missed our connecting flight.

On the flight, the attendant said that we were automatically booked on a flight the next day and would stay in Munich overnight, but when we landed the Lufhansa app said that we were booked to fly to Amsterdam and then to Rome! 

The app, their website and the customer service kiosk in the airport would not let us check in, so we missed that flight. Later we found that the new flight was with KLM, but nowhere did it tell us to check in with them.

We then queued for the Lufhansa customer service desk. In the meantime, my wife was on the phone with Royal Caribbean as they are the agent. After about 2 hours, they managed to get us on a flight with ITA from Rome that evening. They told us to stay in the line for customer service to make sure our luggage is transferred to the correct flight. 

When we got to Rome the bags were nowhere to be seen. Another massive wait for lost luggage confirmed that the bags were still in Munich. The person took all our details and said they would try to get them to our hotel today.

It is now the evening before our cruise and the lost luggage website still shows our claim as ""searching"". We have worn all of the clothes in our carry-on and are frantically trying to hand wash and dry things in the hotel room (no laundry service). 

We've bought a couple of cheap tops from typical tourist shops, but nothing for evening on the ship. 

Our hotel receptionist tried speaking to them (no English staff available) and he was told to check again later. We have been told that a lot of airport staff are on strike, so things are even slower than usual.

We then called the RCCL emergency number and they just said get to the port and tell guest services that you are waiting on luggage. The representative wasn't able to confirm what they will be able to do with regards to help with laundry, suit hire, etc.

Please make sure that you have a few changes of clothes in your carry-on if you have connecting flights. Also make sure that they don't persuade you to check in your carry-on.

TL:DR We are in Rome ready to sail tomorrow, but our luggage is in Munich (we think).

UPDATE: It's now day 2 of our cruise and still no sign of the luggage.

When we boarded we went straight to guest services to see what they could do. They took all the details and said they would work with the airlines to get our bags ASAP. They gave me 2 Royal Caribbean t-shirts that we almost in my size (but none for my wife) and a voucher for free laundry.

We asked how quickly they could get our clothes back to us and they said it would be 5pm the next day. This presented a problem as the only shorts I have are the ones I was wearing. They then (after about an hour of phone calls) said they could do a few items by 8pm which was no good as our dining was 5pm and they couldn't put us on anytime dining. 

I had to keep my shorts and put everything else in the laundry. We met a few other guests on board who are in the same boat (pun intended) and were also scouring the ship's shop to see if anything would fit. 

We are in port at the moment and about to do a tour, but will try to hit the local shops later, but I don't hold out too much hope.

UPDATE 2: On day 2 of the cruise we were informed that the airline has decided to return our bags to our home airport. We are stuck with the few clothes we have and an ongoing free laundry ticket.

UPDATE 3: Day 5 of the cruise and we have a voicemail from our home airport to confirm they have a bag... One bag. Oh dear. We now need to find out which bag and where the heck the other one is.",Nightmare journey to Rome for Rhapsody of the Seas,,IGSketchUK,,15,2022-07-17 16:44:53

Is the night club really worth it for young adults or will it be playing music and be tailored for a slightly older crowd?



I went on one of these when I was very young and I went in some teen room, im not interested in that but is there some place where we most of the people in their 20s gather?


I know the deck hosts parties where they do line dances but those can only take up so much time in a day.


I saw rowdy but obviously we plan to be reasonably respectful since their will be families present. Just trying to see if I need to prepare ahead of time if we want a more exciting experience.",How to have the rowdiest experience possible on Carnival.,,ObamaJuice,,54,2022-07-17 02:45:37

The ship is pulling into a port and those on the lounge chairs all have their heads out of their books and phones to see the passing port scenery.  Passengers run to the one foot of space between the window and chairs to look out without a care that they are blocking the view of others.

The part that irks me is that with reduced speed, we can still easily make the last port call and make it back to Seattle with ample time. I would at least appreciate if they told the truth that they need dock time to fix the engine.

Is there normally some compensation for this due to mechanical failure? We missed what many say is the best stop in Alaska.

I like to have a little more adventure and experience the local culture/food/etc when I travel and honestly I just feel like this is not the vacation for me at this point in my life! But I‚Äôm open to it and don‚Äôt want to be a downer for my friend group who seems to be very interested in going.

Cruise,"Does anyone have experience with using the Briar App while onboard a cruise ship. 
So Briar creates an ad-hoc/mesh network using WiFi Direct AND Bluetooth (for those who don't know). I am curious how well this does or does not work on a cruise ship for texting/communicating with each other.

I hear the ios messaging DOES work off of a similar concept, and people have had success with that. However we are all Android Phone owners.

Yes I am aware that RCL has a messaging app and it's only $2/day PER PERSON. I'm simply searching for an alternative that won't cost us $60, if possible. 

Yes, I am also aware that the cruise ship has lots of metal and will definitely interfere with the signal. However Allure has several open areas where you spend the majority of your time including: The Boardwalk, Central Park, The entire Upper two decks, Pools, Bars, Solarium, etc. Which make this worth a shot.

If you respond, let me know which ship (as some are larger/more open than others) and how many people (strength of mesh network). 

As for my details on my own cruise I will be on RCL Allure of the Seas on July 31st, if that matters.","Experience using the ""Briar App"" or other ad-hoc/mesh network on a cruise ship",,Mr-Java-,,6,2022-07-14 19:01:11

Cruise,"Apologies in advance - I was on the fence whether this belonged in ""simple questions"" or not. I nudged to ""not"" since if I couldn't understand after trying to understand for like an hour, maybe there's also not a simple answer...

To the point, I'm looking at a cruise on NCL's site. Before choosing in general whether I want Inside/Oceanview etc., there's an icon (dollar bills) and an explanation saying it's ""free second guest"" for Oceanview and above. Fair enough - I choose Oceanview.

I then look at the different types of Oceanviews and see the regular Oceanview says ""$1414"". Again, fair enough. I choose it.

I now have two options in the offers - I can either take ""FREE SECOND GUEST"" or ""FREE AT SEA"". The free at sea option indeed shows $1414 per guest + taxes, coming in at $3413. However, the ""free second guest"" option shows the breakdown as $2175 for the first guest, $0 for the second, and then another $585 for taxes, for a total of $2760.

I understand the taxes aren't included. Even so, how does $1414 + free second guest + get to $2760? Why did they bump the base fare to $2175 in the first place?","Is there a trick to understanding NCL's ""free second guest"" pricing?",,Xolver,,10,2022-07-14 17:26:38
Cruise,"Very recently went on a cruise from NJ to the Bahamas.  We splurged (and benefited, I think, from some Covid pricing when we booked), and went for Sky Class with a Crown Loft Suite.  In case this is useful to anyone, here is my review:

**Crown Loft Suite**

Just a beautiful room.  Upon first walking in, a tad smaller than expected, as was the master bathroom.  But after a very short while, you really get a feel for how special these rooms are.   Lying on the second-level bed, looking at the passing ocean through the 20 foot windows, was good for the soul.  The espresso machine actually makes great Lavazza coffee, and we‚Äôll purposefully not think about the last time it‚Äôs probably been deep-cleaned :).

The room was just amazing enough that it was a treat to come back to every night, but not so over-the-top that we‚Äôd feel like we were wasting it by not being in it all the time.

**Pool**

Nowhere near as difficult to get a chair as many posts have implied.  And any day you don‚Äôt get off the boat at a port, you literally have your pick.  Even on day 6, a sea day, there were tons of open chairs in the front row.

**Coastal Kitchen**

Food and service were magnificent.  Definitely a big plus of the suite class.  The restaurant was almost never crowded, which surprised us.  The wait staff and maitre‚Äôds were so attentive.  Our daughter has a food allergy and they started preparing her dishes the moment they saw us walk in.  CK was without question the highlight of the trip, and the convenience of our stateroom being steps away was significant.

**Suite Lounge**

This was a bit underwhelming.  It‚Äôs connected to the CK, and is well-appointed.  However, the food/appetizers they were putting out was for the most part fairly pedestrian.  A few nights were outliers with shrimp and lox, but I‚Äôll be honest we were expecting a little more.  The self-service coffee was difficult to figure out, and there were no ice or water machines.  There was a bar right there, so you could always ask for whatever you wanted, but sometimes you just want to roll out of bed and get something with no interaction. 

**Casino**

Blackjack correctly paid 3:2 at $15 tables, but only 6:5 at $10.  No surrender option, though, and dealer hits a soft 17.

Craps was single-odds, which can only be described as comical. 

Slots, though difficult to know for sure what the payback percentage is set at, is likely in the 70s (the lowest legal limit).  So‚Ä¶ akin to lighting your money on fire.  Had a decent assortment of the newish games like Buffalo, but none of the wildly popular Dragon Link machines.

Video poker was a lot better, with some double bonus machines paying decent-for-a-cruise 9/5/4.  With perfect play, these machines can hit 96%.  With even just some basic knowledge, you could probably achieve 93% or so. 

**Windjammer**

Only went a few times.  When did they adjust the hours?  It‚Äôs only open at the most basic mealtimes now, closing at the absurd hour of 9pm.  I swear we used to be able to go here for late night munchies/desserts.

**Aqua80**

Beyond magnificent.  Blew my high expectations out of the water.  The charisma of these young performers was a sight to behold.  They were having a great time, and so were we.

**Frozen in Time**

Much better than we expected.  The performers were quite good, flawlessly executing many maneuvers I never expected to see at sea.  Worth watching for sure. 

**Central Park**

This was our first time on a ship with Central Park.  It‚Äôs a nice spot to walk but a little underwhelming, honestly.  Felt more like a long garden with mostly bushes.  I know many of you have spoken about the soft live music at night - we didn‚Äôt hear any of that.  I‚Äôm sure we just went at the wrong times.  

**Suite Sun Deck**

Definitely felt exclusive but not a lot to do, and many of the views off the ship were blocked by the solarium roof.  A bit inconvenient to get to, which is likely why it felt underutilized.  I went there once and never felt the need to go again. 

**Bath products**

On many of the YouTube videos of the Oasis suites, they mention the Loccitane bath products as a perk.  They‚Äôve been replaced with a brand I‚Äôve never heard of: Marlin + Geotz.  This may be a good brand, but it still came out of the pumps (one each for body wash, shampoo, and conditioner), and this just doesn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äòsuite‚Äô treatment.  I‚Äôm definitely pumping from the same bottle as the last hundred guests, and that feels a little weird.  Even at cheap hotels they give you the little bottles.

**Tipping**

We chose to remove the auto gratuities, because we didn‚Äôt eat in the MDR once, and apparently, they can‚Äôt just move your MDR tips to CK.  So it‚Äôs all or nothing.  This necessitated us getting a ton of envelopes, and tipping everyone individually.  This included attendants, chefs, maitre‚Äôds, waiters, and concierges.  We tipped every meal, as well as final tips that ended up being about 170% of what the auto gratuities were.  


Overall, it was an incredible experience.  Don‚Äôt think we could go back to a non-suite; the second bathroom was key, the 17th floor was very quiet, the concierges were super helpful, and the CK was delightful.

Cruise,"Taking my second Celebrity cruise in a few months. First one was 5 years ago, pre-transition.  I am trans and non-binary; I have an X (neutral) gender marker on my drivers license and an F (sex assigned at birth) on my passport.

I know on cruises the crew are trained to use sir and ma‚Äôam (I think I‚Äôve heard madam and miss too?).

At first i played slots each day on a cruise. Not a huge $ammt  but time in the casino. I was given a free cruise, interior cabin, after my second cruise. 
I was given another cruise by mail. I was invited to join their ""club"" for mailings. I usually drop$500-1000 in the casino on a10 day cruise, less on a shorter one. 
After a few cruises, they started offering balconies. Then large credits for the casino($500-1000). Each free cruise offer is good for 3 cruises. Since covid they also give me all drinks, tips, internet, laundry, and specialty restaurant.
Now, its a balcony or minisuite, and all the extras and i probably get two offers a month.

\-The front of the ship is the worst to bunk in. Yes it's beautiful, but you'll be hyper aware that the ship is moving and it'll make you sea sick if you're unfamiliar with the sensation.

\-You're probably still gonna get Covid. Shitty people can easily evade a Covid test. (Source: recovering from covid currently after taking TWO tests before getting onboard)

\-On Cruising day, GET UP EARLY and get yourself a spot in the pool and a beach chair. Once 11AM hits everyone and their mom is gonna be in the pool and there will be NO ROOM. And when you get a beach chair, guard it with your life lmao people swoop in like literal vultures for a spot to tan in.

\-It's a giant pissing contest. Everyone wants to know who you are and what you do and why their job is better than yours. I swear to God its the most obnoxious thing to overhear and even worse when it happens to you. I make good money for my age but Im very private about my work because my job is niche and usually people ask way too many questions that I care to answer. I see this mostly with the boomers (sorry, it's the truth). Younger peeps, not as much.

\-Speaking of younger peeps (20s to 30s) holy shit can they party. There were nights we'd be in the club until 2AM and then sit and smoke on the top deck pretty much all night. I made good friends and memories.

\-Dont do the worm on the club dance floor, it ain't worth it.

\-Yeah most of you won't like this one. My experience as a black woman... you meet a lot of rude and entitled white people (typically middle aged to older but not all) I swear to God, I was cut in line multiple times, shoved HARD with no excuse me, watched a woman steal my beach chair and THROW my things off of it into the sand while I got a drink at the bar, and more which I'll tell in a comment below because some stories are longer. I am a patient woman, I don't like to scream racism whenever its convenient, but these are just the facts of what happened. People, usually white, forget that this is a shared space and we are ALL on vacation and just trying to get by, not just you and your rug rat who won't even remember this trip. That being said, not everyone was like this and I met many wonderful people, but I couldn't help but notice that stressed out white mothers seemed to be the most entitled, the loudest and hardest to get along with. Note: I discussed this with the younger folks and they said they had similar experiences as well, some of which were even white themselves.

\-IF YOU ARE A WOMAN SOLO CRUISER and you decide to club til 4am like I did, BE CAREFUL. Some of the men get a little aggressive at night. If its late and you hear someone try to get your attention in a hallway ad you're alone, ignore them and walk faster with your head on a swivel. When I was walking back to my room from a night out I was flagged down by a man who pretended to be lost and then pathetically yet scarily attempted to persuade me back to his room for the night. If it weren't for the fact that I was bigger/taller than him and I could snap him in fucking half, I don't know how safe it would've been given the fact I said no multiple times. I was warned sexual assaults happen on cruise ships occasionally so stay in groups if you can.

\-HYDRATE, its so easy to forget with all the drinking and partying. Nearly passed out in Coco Cay bc I was dehydrated.

\-Lol From what I saw... everyone is fucking. Everyone. By the time it was over everyone knew what color everyones nipples were.

\-If you're gonna get a drinking package and you're trying to get lit, do nothing but shots. The drinks on the cruise seem to be really novelty like and you need several to get a buzz. 2 shots of Patron should do it.

\-Royal Caribbean has EXCEPTIONAL service. I have never been waited on so well before by everyone. Buffets, bars, restaurants, room service, you name it. Also they remembered my (ethnic) name!!! My room servicer Arya was the best and I made sure I tipped him very well. &lt;3

I hope this was helpful! Just some things I noticed. All the negativity aside, I truly enjoyed myself and was worth every penny.

EDIT: You guys are all so sweet. No resentment at all, 95 percent of cruisers are chill as hell, you guys included. Have a great day everyone!

EDIT 2: Sorry for all the edits BUT THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD! :D

LAST EDIT: Apparently someone thought this was a troll post, and Im honestly kinda hype that my life is so cool someone thought it was fake LMAO NICE",Went on my (23f) first cruise! Some thoughts...,,Imsosickofbullshit,,228,2022-07-13 13:41:32

Cruise,"Since Venice banned cruise ships in the Giudecca canal I've looked at some cruises that are technically originating out of Venice but in reality leave from Trieste or Ravenna. Trieste is about 2.5 hours by train from Venice; Ravenna is four hours. I just can't understand why they can't anchor the ship on the other side of Lido. I've stayed on Lido and it only took a few extra minutes to get to central Venice. The distance (or time) to the ship would actually be less than the time it took to go from St. Mark's Square to the old cruise port.

Does anyone know the reason for this? FWIW, I visited Ravenna as a port call and it is a wonderful stop. I had never visited before because it is such a difficult place to get to. It's still difficult to get to, so it seems like a lousy embarkation site.",Why can't Venice ships anchor near Lido and tender?,,EarlVanDorn,,17,2022-07-13 02:58:52

Cruise,"What's about: Story about why i want to bring weed on the cruise. And question about the controls at the first day check-in at Barcelona harbour.

Hey,  i am 21 year old dude from Germany and i am thinking about traveling alone on Royal Caribbean Wonder of the Seas. 
In order to make the trip even more enjoyable i thought about ways to bring some weed with me on the ship. Considering all the food i just have to bring some with me. 
In my opinion edible gummies colored like real ""haribo goldb√§ren"" packaged in the original enclosure would be the safest way. 
From past cruises without weed i know how the security in German harbours work. 
Your hand luggage travels threw a scanner where they watch out for weapons and alcohol. Meanwhile you are going through a scanner too. 
So my idea was to bring one or two gummy packages in hand luggage with me. 
Sadly as the title suggests this time its a Mediterranean cruise and the departure harbour is in Barcelona. 

Maybe some of you have had departure at the Barcelona harbour and know how the check in process works. How does it work and is it similiar to Germany? And has anyone seen any police dogs at the check in? 

How i get Gummies from Germany to Barcelona?:

Cruise,"My party was a total of 6 people. 1 person does not have an American passport, but a Vietnamese one. She JUST received a US citizenship, and had to send in her greencard. She only had a Vietnamese passport, and a certificate of US citizenship that was just sent out to us. Unfortunately she forgot to bring that citizenship, and they did not let her in the cruise. They gave me a physical letter about how the appropriate documentation was listed on their website. They do not know if she will get future cruise credit or not. This happened 30 minutes before the cruise was about to take off. We couldn't drive home since we are over an hour away from the port. When I asked them what time they were taking off, they said ""15 minutes"". They left nearly 2 hours later which was more then enough time for me to grab her paperwork from our house. I'm upset they lied about the time.

I don't know what to do since I have already paid over 9k for all 6 people, and only 5 of which were able to go. 
I don't know how to talk to them about this because they do not seem accommodating based on what I experienced at the port. This is our first time cruising.

Cruise,"My husband (34M) and I (33F) are expecting our first baby any day now, and I‚Äôm occupying my brain by planning vacations like I always do. We‚Äôve been to WDW several times as a couple, but I‚Äôm thinking cruising might be a little more manageable for the next couple years at least. I‚Äôve been on several cruises as a kid with NCL and two with Carnival, but my husband has never cruised.

Baby isn‚Äôt here yet so we have no idea what daily life will be like, not to mention traveling - so I figured I‚Äôd ask!

1. Fly or drive? We live within an hour of the NYC/NJ cruise terminal, which sounds like the easiest plan to me. We could bring diapers, wipes, food &amp; an umbrella stroller without checking luggage‚Ä¶and do a same-day arrival without the fear of missing embarkation. If we fly, we would have far more options out of Florida but taking a baby on a plane intimidates me.

For this reason, we‚Äôre leaning toward Royal but we are open to other lines. We‚Äôd love to do a Disney cruise but we‚Äôd have to fly.

2. I‚Äôm a teacher, so specific dates are limited - assuming we stick to NYC the cruise options that sail during breaks and have a nursery onboard are:

Anthem over spring break (he‚Äôll be 8mo)
Oasis over summer (he‚Äôll be 11-12mo)
Liberty over summer, for shorter duration

3. We aren‚Äôt picky with destinations at all this time around. If we can manage to enjoy some good meals, hot tub time, and trivia/shows either with the little one with us or in the nursery, I‚Äôll consider it a win. We could potentially invite my parents, who love cruising, to join us and get some more childcare options, but we don‚Äôt know how involved they‚Äôll want to be yet (first grandchild/they live out of state).

Any thoughts/advice welcome! I hope we don‚Äôt have to wait until he‚Äôs 3 to have a good time.",First cruise with a baby - DCL or RCL? Tips?,,Majestic_Ad_5205,,62,2022-07-12 11:42:31

Cruise,"I cruised in Alaska a total of 4 times (going to be 5 this August!) on Princess, Celebrity and Holland America. Overall I think my cruise total is about 15.

In no particular order these are my main tips for cruising in Alaska:

1. Make sure **Glacier Bay** is listed on your cruise itinerary - not all ships have permits to enter the National Park! I cannot stress this enough - there is NO alternative that is similar to this experience. It is breathtaking and awe inspiring and should not be missed.
2. Try to make sure your Glacier Bay stop is **after August 31st** to ensure you get the FULL experience! Many people don't know that the National Park service limits how far boats (and cruise ships) can enter during seal pup season. The earliest they open the Johns Hopkins Inlet and other areas is July 15th but most years it has been late August. What is the difference? Early season Glacier Bay visits will often be 3 to 4 hours where you get to see one or two gorgeous glaciers. Late season Glacier Bay visits are 8 to 9 hours and you get to see many more glaciers (plus the cute seal pups!). You can check out the nps website for more details. Once we discovered this fact we solely cruise in late August now (we did May and July before).
3. Pick a **smaller ship** if you want to get close to the glaciers! The larger vessels simply can't maneuver close to the glaciers and are often prohibited from going into the narrow inlets. I personally like Holland America ships since they have an optimal size for cruising Alaska.
4. **Ports:** Juneau is great for seeing whales and Sitka is great for seeing other wildlife such as otters and eagles. Skagway has a wonderful train and Ketchikan is incredibly picturesque. I personally really love seeing otters floating in the ocean so I try to book an itinerary with Sitka.
5. **Seattle or Vancouver?** If you are in the US I would go with roundtrip from Seattle because it is incredibly easy and significantly less expensive than Vancouver. In case you didn't know Seattle offers a valet luggage service to several cruise lines (one of which is Holland America I know from experience). They can take your luggage from the terminal directly to the ship (you don't have to go to the carousel!) and/or they can take it from the ship directly to the airport for you for a charge ($25pp normally). You can tour Seattle baggage free before or after your cruise!
6. **Balcony?** Yes I always book a balcony because I adore sitting and hearing the whales and watching the shore line. The ship always turns at glaciers to give both sides equal views (assuming you are on a small enough ship to maneuver) so it doesn't matter which side you book. If you elect not to book a balcony just be warned that the public areas fill up fast for scenic viewing, such as Glacier Bay. I would advise showing up early.
7. **Which cruise line?** I enjoyed every Alaskan cruise I have been on but I am returning to Holland America for the 3rd time for a reason. The itinerary was perfect and the ship size is great for Alaska. And since we tend to cruise with extended family I have to mention that the BB King's live music has been a huge hit for all generations. Celebrity was probably my least favorite just because they didn't go very far into Glacier Bay but I am not sure whether that was due to the ship's size or the time of year we cruised. Princess was nice but rather dated (they often have their oldest ships in Alaska).
8. **When to book?** I am always amazed at how much some people have spent booking an Alaskan cruise a year in advance. If you have any flexibility with dates or room types (they can sell out of some of the fancier suites) try booking when the season starts (May/June) for a late August cruise. I've gotten some amazing deals on suites and nice balcony rooms that way. You can visit vacationstogo, travelzoo or prestige cruises to find deals.
9. Don't forget **stockholder** onboard credit! If you own 100 shares of Carnival (Norwegian and Royal Caribbean have their own version) check out their stockholder benefits. You get anywhere from $50 to $250 per cabin PER CRUISE. You send a quick email and get onboard credit automatically applied to your cruise. The Carnival stock works for the entire parent company of cruise lines: Carnival, Princess, Holland America, Seabourn, Cunard and Costa in the US.

I hope everyone on the fence about cruising Alaska will take the leap and go - it is incredibly beautiful! Enjoy :)",Alaska Cruise Tips! (did you know they close part of Glacier Bay for pup season?),,Travelpuff,,13,2022-07-11 23:43:19

Cruise,"About us: 28 yo couple. We are adventurous and like to do things. We're regularly going out to new restaurants/bars/karaoke, or into the mountains in our area to rock climb, or go rafting, etc. We like to keep things planned so we don't feel we've wasted any time.

# Option 1:

## RCL Symphony of the Seas 
### Ports: 
* Philipsburg, St. Maarten (8a-6p)
* Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas (7a-4p)
* Perfect Day at CocoCay, Bahamas (10a-6p)

### Info:
* 3 days at sea
* 7 night trip
* Balcony room
* We'd upgrade and do specialty dining for most of the trip because I personally think RCLs MDR is lackluster 9/10 times.


# Option 2: 
 
## Celebrity Equinox
### Ports:
* San Juan, Puerto Rico (4p-11p)
* Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas (9a-6p)
* Philipsburg, St. Maarten (8a-6p)
* Tortola, B.V.I. (7a-3p)
* Nassau, Bahamas (12:30p-6p)

### Info:
* 2 days at sea
* 8 night trip
* Veranda room


Concerns:

I'm not in love with RCLs route. I could care less about going to CocoCay and would prefer having one more foreign port to explore. In addition, a lot of time is spent on board BUT I've been on symphony of the seas and there is truly so much to do that isn't a major concern. I actively want to get back on that ship to explore more since I didn't see everything when I was on it. One thing to keep in mind is a lot of money will be spent upgrading to specialty dining (at least that is the plan. We are scheduling this last minute so who knows if there is availability)

Conversely, I'm nervous about getting bored on the Equinox. It doesn't seem to have much to do besides eat or drink. The idea of going to 3 additional ports (not including CocoCay) and staying 1 more night is really exciting though. And the time in port is better imo than the time in port on RCL. I'm also concerned about the atmosphere on a celebrity ship. While I will probably dress up each night for dinner because that's my personality, my bf is really put off by the requirement to have to wear pants to dine. Especially in the middle of the Caribbean in the summer. I believe celebrity does group dining? I worry we'll be the youngest people at our table once we get there. Truthfully, I would prefer if we could just eat alone. I don't want to go on a cruise to meet other people for dinner. I go to enjoy my time with my partner. 


Feeling really conflicted. For relatively similar money, I think I'm leaning towards Celebrity because I place more emphasis on the ports than the ship but I'm nervous because I am completely uninterested in most everything related to the Equinox ship. It just doesn't seem like there will be much to do which is going to mean 2 days of the trip will be uninteresting.

Cruise,"Everyone‚Äôs last test is literally several days before they embark.  On some ships, you‚Äôre talking about 6,000 people.  The idea that you have any protection at all from ‚Äúbad faith actors‚Äù once you board is ludicrous, and it starts with the ‚Äúhave you had Covid, or been exposed to Covid, or have any symptoms at all, over the last 10 days?‚Äù

I‚Äôm on a cruise right now and almost nobody is taking precautions seriously.  My family and I are wearing N95s indoors at most times, and I understand that is a personal choice - I cannot expect the same level of precaution from others.  It‚Äôs my choice to go on a cruise, and I know others are ok with less precaution. 

So my point is, based on what I‚Äôm seeing, that if you think even 5% of those who recovered from Covid in the last 10 days are canceling their long-awaited vacations, you are dreaming.  If they test negative, they‚Äôre going, and so should you. 

And from a game theory perspective (will I save even one person from improbably catching ‚Äúmy‚Äù recently-recovered Covid, who would not have gotten it from the likely 1,000+ people who have either a) recently recovered too, or b) more likely, partied it up back home in the two days between testing and embarkation - it would be completely impossible to defend canceling a trip for this reason.

I take Covid very seriously (see N95), but these questions are right up there with the old airline ‚Äúdid you pack your bags yourself?‚Äù  Which, you‚Äôll all remember, the airlines stopped asking because it was a complete waste of time.

I originally booked the Joy, but in looking at recent videos of the ship at full capacity it looks a bit crammed.

Cruise,"Hi. I‚Äôve gone on a few cruises, and they‚Äôve always been very fun. I usually go on Carnival or sometimes Norwegian But I‚Äôve always gone as a child or a teenager. The most fun part of a cruise was meeting new friends and doing activities together. The thing is, that this mostly happened cause we were pretty much made to stay in the same place. I mean with the child group and the teen group. There would be a hangout place, where you could just chill, or the adults would organize some sort of game like a scavenger hunt or something. Even if we didn‚Äôt want to play, I could always rely on being in the same place and make new friends cause of it. Friends that would only last for the duration of the cruise obviously, but still.

Now, I‚Äôm 19. I‚Äôm going on another Carnival cruise soon. What do people my age do? There won‚Äôt be any groups for my age right? And it kinda feels like the general activities are for older people, and it‚Äôs also harder to make friends cause there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll always see the same people around.

Cruise,"I'm a cruise veteran. Mostly Princess and Royal Caribbean, this was my first cruise on NCL and have some thoughts.   
Ship: Was on the Norwegian Getaway, a ""Breakaway"" class ship. Liked the ship itself. Nice layout, rode nice, easy to navigate, lots of structural onboard amenities (water park, etc)  


**Food:** This was my single biggest complaint. The buffet was lousy. The other base dining options (Taste, Savor, Tropicana room) had some hits, but a LOT of misses. The specialty dining options we tried (Chuscaria, Cagneys, Tapinyake) were mediocre at best. Really disappointing. Getting back to the buffet, ive had better food at the Golden Corral. A REAL step down from Princess and RC. Getting an overcooked, unseasoned and also lukewarm prime rib was the last straw.   


**Bar/Drink package:** Major points to NCL here, no complaints. Very generous with pours and quality of service.   


**Entertainment:** Good to above average. One of the comedians we had was awful, the rest was pretty good. No complaints  


**Room**: Room was fine, we got a standard balcony and it was what we expected.   


**In-Room entertainment**: Non-existent... I'm used to having some free movies and access to some TV channels or some sort of in-room entertainment. On NCL you get NOTHING free. Everything was pay. Except the BBC news channel. Really felt nickeled and dimed here...   


**Crew / Service**: No complaints. Our steward and all of our wait staff were very good. Most of the bartenders were good. Some bartenders need to learn a lot more, there were a couple I learned to avoid. 

**Overall value**: I feel overall, at least with the free upgrades they are ***currently offering***, it s a VERY good deal. I felt value in the overall package. But be aware of the $16/person daily gratuity that they hide in the disclosures. Not a big deal, but just be aware. The food was a BIG standout that it was just a huge step down. I don't know if this is a post-covid thing or if it's always been this way.   


I know better than to do Carnival, and I thought NCL would be somewhere inbetween them and Princess/RC and it was. There were still a lot of kids, but not too many to ruin the experience.

Cruise,"I would love to do a Panama canal cruise and have been looking into it for a bit. Although I am still unsure about which to go with. Any package I'd go with would have at least a drink package. I have been looking at a few options fland, NCL, and even princess. I am not really a party person, but I would not mind it if it was more of a party drink/ship. I am not a fan of overly formal dress codes. Smart casual such as collard polo shirt and nice slacks/dress pants are find, but full saw, ties, or dinner jackets are a no go.

I seen 2 options for historic locks 10/11 days which would be about $2,500 or so 1 from fort Lauderdale the closest port (holland) to me, and the other in MiamiForthave an option for a princess cruise from fort Lauderdale with the new locks for quite a bit cheaper while the others are for an inside room with their all-in with drink package, wifi, specialty dinning, I could do inside here with medalion for far less or get a balcony room for about the price of th15-dayt two options.

My last option is for a 15 day cruise from NCL in a solo cabin on a bigger ship so new locks. It is a one-way trip ending in LA meaning I'd have to fly back home, but that before the flight would be a little cheaper than the historic locks, but might be about even depending on the flight home (the cheapest I have seen was about $200 from LAX)

All these are for early 2023 as for the most part I should be free with being about to get that time off with the exception of the 1st week of January which is very unlikely to be possible.

I have been on one cruise so far the NCL joy and I really liked it, the only small complaint I would have was that the TV/onboard media did not have much in the way of good options for entertainment, but honestly, I did not care that much about it to let that influence my choice.

So I'd love some opinions about what would be my better option. Spend more for a partial historic lock crossing, spend less with Princess for a new lock crossing or use that lower price to upgrade a room, or should I go all-in for the 15-day cruise and have to uber/take a flight? The last option I would believe will end up at around the historic lock prices after the flight.

Cruise,"So I need some insight, and go easy on me because when I booked this cruise it was my first time booking a cruise and I don't understand a lot of the protocol.

We booked a year out for a 7 night Alaskan cruise on Ovation of the seas. We are expecting beautiful views so we went ahead and splurged on the balcony room. So we get our boarding info the other day since the cruise is in a month, and we were assigned an obstructed balcony view. I looked it up online and the view is pretty badly obstructed IMO. 

Now when booking we did select the ""let Royal Carribean select your room"" option because it was cheaper. But I thought that was just referring to floor location, like maybe someone would want to be on a more quiet floor, closer to the casino, etc. I would have never imagined it would mean having an obstructed view.

I thought these rooms are generally cheaper because of the obstructed view, and not just the $40 less for letting Royal choose your placement. In my mind I paid full price for an ocean view balcony room. Is this incorrect? 

We have called and the cruise is fully sold out so there is nothing they can do. I feel pretty disappointed, because I had no idea this would be a possibility.

I am thinking about booking a NCL 3-night cruise to Bahamas, but I'm very hesitant. My wife (F/F couple) and I have never been on a cruise. We live in Miami, and for our upcoming 4-day weekend (not a holiday, just our schedules line up to give us a 4-day weekend), we cannot find a decent flight anywhere, so we thought, why not take the 15 min Uber to the port and get on a cruise.

However, we aren't sure if cruising is for us. We are fine diners and we are kind of fancy, tbh. We are very much city people, and spend our time split between Miami and NYC. We do like to enjoy beach vacations, however. We don't do buffets (except at like breakfast, I guess). From what I see Virgin is probaby the closest to our tastes, but they don't have a cruise that fits into our schedule for this long weekend.

The only options seem to be Carnival, which looks like something I would not enjoy, and NCL.

Cruise,"I was on the Norwegian Sun when it crashed into an iceberg. Trying to figure out how to use our additional cruise credits for another alaska cruise since our refund came through today.

The Bliss looks like a really fun ship. The only problem is, the itinerary I would want that has all of the ports we missed (Skagway, Juneau, and Kechikan) does not sail until Sept 24. It looks like this itinerary is for off season cruises. Seeing the northern lights is on my bucket list, and I really want to do the railway in Skagway. Is this an okay time to go, or am I setting us up for another disappointing cruise? I understand it may be cold and rainy.

There are other sailings on the Bliss that are earlier, but does not stop in Skagway and we would have repeats of stops at Sitka and Icy Straight Point that we already went to.

Should I just compromise and pick a different ship? We really do not want to go on the Sun again. Really want to try out a ship that is a little bigger with more to do. Thanks for any input.

Cruise,"Hey There Cruisers!

I have a general question about the role of Travel Agents (US-Based).

We currently use a TA for our cruises. Our current TA is very nice, but only handles the cruise portion.  We usually book the cruise ourselves (online or via NextCruise) and then xfer the booking to her.  We monitor the cruise prices and tell her when we find a cheaper fare.  She contacts the cruise company and get our price adjusted.  She also sells us trip insurance, but only offers one carrier for insurance. 

We cruised multiple times (at least 2x/yr),usually stay in suites, and tend to cruise 7+ days, which is to say, we spend some money for these vacations. 

I'd like to find someone who can arrange our cruise tix, overnight hotel, flight arrangements, transportation to/from cruise port. Am I expecting too much from my TA?

However, I am a little confused after reading the [NCL](https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/cruise-faq/if-i-recently-recovered-covid-19-do-i-need-get-tested-prior-embarkation) website. They make it sound like you need to have the *doctor's note* no less than 10 days before sailing, not just the positive test. That would mean that you can no longer test positive less than 20 days before sailing (10 days of isolation + 10 days before sailing).  Which would also mean I'm out of luck I guess. I called to ask, and the rep was unsure. I guess I just want to see if anyone has any experience with this.

UPDATE: 

I was able to confirm with NCL that you will indeed need a recovery note from the doctor at least 10 days prior to sailing. Which means the latest you can test positive and use a recovery letter is 21 days from sailing (they count the test day as day 0). At that point, cross your fingers and hope you‚Äôre not one of the unlucky people that will test positive for weeks. This is in contrast to basically all the other cruise lines, which allow the recovery letter before the sailing date, per CDC guidance. I missed that deadline by 1 day. The good news for me is that I am now testing negative, and still have 14 days before I sail. I tested negative on day 11 after onset of symptoms.",NCL Covid Documentation of Recovery Timeline?,,kidsandbarbells,,10,2022-07-05 17:27:52

Cruise,"I have never done a cruise before, but am hearing that the best way to see Alaska is by cruise- the mega 2000+ person cruises are unappealing to me (i.e. Princess, HAL, etc.), looking for something smaller and a little nicer (updated staterooms). More interested in good excursions and outdoor activities than onboard entertainment. My boyfriend and I are able to spend around $4000 total per person (incl. excursions), and we love hiking, kayaking, nature, etc. We are in our early 30s. 

Oceania sounds a little closer to what I'm looking for, around 500 people with nicer food and staterooms, but it seems like lately a lot of their cruises have bad reviews post-covid. Anyone with recent experience on the Oceania Regatta to Alaska? Or any other cruise line brands similar to this? 

A lot of people seem to recommend Uncruise and Linblad but they are a little outside of our price range and the Uncruise boats seem outdated.

Cruise,"New to the r/cruise community but this sub was super helpful navigating what might happen when I tested positive the other day. Would love to help more people who are navigating this! 

Basic overview: tested negative the morning of day 5 even though I felt a bit off. By the end of the day I knew I was coming down with something so late at night I took an antigen test that I had brought with me and it came back positive. Notified the cruise the next morning. They sent someone to collect a PCR sample which came back positive (surprise!). 

Since our port of call is in Italy, I packed up all of my stuff and they placed me in an isolation room on deck 4. This was over the course of several hours. My initial call to medical was around 8 am. They tested me at around 8:45. I wasn‚Äôt moved until 11am. 

They checked my breathing, my vaccination status, and my previous plans for after the cruise. As of writing this Royal Caribbean prorates your cruise cost from the point of testing positive, covers transfer and accommodation to further isolation after the cruise and reimburses up to $400 of airfare changes. Italy requires 7 days of isolation and 2 negative tests before you‚Äôre released to continue on. 

As of writing this I‚Äôll get off the boat tomorrow morning, be transferred to accommodation where I‚Äôll hang out for 5 days, and then will hopefully be able to go home after two negative tests. 

Again, I really appreciated another persons post about this process, so I just wanted to help out anyone else who might be curious or going through this!

Edit 1: I received some new information that some folks had asked about regarding staying on the ship for our quarantine. Initially this option wasn‚Äôt given to us, but the night before disembarking we were given a letter regarding reimbursement by the cruise line that included that option. The letter also said that in all cases where it‚Äôs possible they provide the option to stay on the boat, so if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in definitely ask upon testing.

Edit 2: Just arrived at the hotel. There are two of us staying in the room so we were able to get a ‚Äúbigger family‚Äù room, but it‚Äôs not huge by any means. A queen and a twin bed that has a bunk option on top. A decent sized bathroom and balcony. There‚Äôs a small tv and closet. It‚Äôs no suite, but with the balcony it‚Äôll be fine for another few days. 

They‚Äôll be bringing us our meals on paper but we re-use our silverware. We‚Äôll test again on day 7 by walking down to the pharmacy.

Edit 3/Final Update: Hi guys! Sorry it‚Äôs been a second! There was a whole lot of nothing happening and then everything happened all at once. The hotel was lovely given the circumstances! We had 3 meals a day delivered to our door and it was all yummy homemade Italian food. If we needed anything extra they were super happy to accommodate. 

In general everything about our stay was really vague. It‚Äôs pretty much just the hotel people watching you and making sure you stay the full amount of time. We had some self test kits and I started testing negative on day 5. On day 7 a friend we met during this whole thing showed us where the pharmacy was and we both tested negative there too!! 

As far as the testing: there are apparently a few pharmacies that work with the government to do post-isolation testing. The pharmacist asked to see all our documents from Royal Caribbean (date of first test and date of start of isolation) and our vaccination cards and passports. These documents are super important!! Otherwise they don‚Äôt know when your 7 days are up. Once we let her know what we were there for and she inspected our documents, entered some information into the computer, and took us into the back for the tests. She administered two antigen tests and then told us to go wait outside. 15 minutes later she came out and told us we were negative and handed us papers documenting that we were negative. Woohoo!!

This all happened on Friday. Ahead of time we had booked tentative flights for Monday and decided that if we did test negative we would head to the airport town for a few days before our flight. When we got back to our hotel we let the hotel know we would be checking out, packed our bags and caught a train! 

Now, Monday morning we‚Äôre waiting for our flights to finally head home!!",Tested positive for Covid on day 5/7 of a Royal Caribbean Mediterranean cruise. AMA!,,hagi03,,61,2022-07-02 14:05:41
Cruise,"Hello, UK first-time cruiser here!

I've spent hours Googling this and even called P&amp;O - I can't seem to find a straight answer anywhere.

I head to France a lot throughout the year for business. I have a cruised booked in the near future and if all 7 days of that cruise count towards my Schengen allowance, it will put me at 91 days in 180. Big no-no. I have a way around it if this is how it's going to work though that ""way"" isn't very convenient.

The cruise I'm on departs from Southampton on day 1, spends a day at sea on day 2, then arrives at a Norwegian port on day 3.

My question is do those first 2 days at sea count towards time in the Schengen zone, or are you only in the zone when you arrive at your first port?

Answers have varied from no to yes. Some mention stamps, some mention how it's becoming fully automatic now, and I just can't tell what the story is!

I mean...stupid question maybe, but how do the cruise guys manage to stay always perfect? Always clean cut, always well dressed. Initially i thought at the SPA...but I cannot recall seeing people wearing the name tags coming and going...

Think about something as basic as an haircut...how do they do? Is it true that there are crewmembers who do a kind of a second job, as barbers, house keepers, crew stewards? How does this happen? Is there any kind of board where the guys place an ad?

LOL i know it may sound ridiculous, but for those who are not seafarers these things are far from obvious.

I remember some months ago, during a cruise inside a NCL's ship, I was talking to a young german guy who was supposedly an officer since he had 2 stripes on his shoulders who was fun, telling me he'd rather go to the moon alone, instead of learning to press shirts.

So, I suppose that there is some kind of paid services which take care of these things...should be a nice business for those people who spend their spare time in providing these services, if they're not already officially available for a fee.","The ""Blackmarket"" which happens behind the scenes...crew's ""second jobs"".",,hugeunic0rn,,38,2022-07-02 00:18:01

Cruise,"So we planned this cruise way back in Aug 2021 with my family and have been eagerly awaiting it ever since. We started it early by flying out to Seattle 2 weeks ago and explored the city for a couple of days. We got to go up the Space Needle at night, which was really cool. We also explored a few more attractions using the CityPass 5 attractions deal. Then came the day to travel up to Seward to get on the cruise. We flew into Anchorage then took a 4-5 hr Alaskan Railroad ride to Seward. The train ride was amazing with lots of unique views in a unique bubble window passenger car. Our negative COVID test results arrived in our emails during this rail journey and we were able to get onto the NCL Jewel without issue. The ship had only 1300 passengers so it wasn't incredibly full which was really nice. We set off at 9pm and I  decided to take advantage of my adult beverage package and explore the ship. I had a few, enjoyed the eerie dusk sunlight until midnight then I decided to head off to bed. 

The next day, we walked around the ship and found the board game and cards room while the ship visited some glaciers while at sea. I started having a little tickle in my throat but other than that, I felt fine and chalked it off as using the ship tap water in my CPAP machine. By 6pm, I decided to retire early and went to sleep while everyone else explored the ship. During the night, I started coughing and wasn't feeling well. The next morning, I decided to test myself with an at-home COVID test and it immediately turned positive. I waited 15 more mins to be sure and sure enough, it still was indicating that I was in the C-club. 

I called up guest relations where they informed their medical department that I was symptomatic for COVID and that I took a test and was positive and told me to stay inside my cabin. Within an hour, a nurse stopped by in full PPE and had me go thru a ton of documentation. They wanted my recollection of where I was, what I ate, etc for the last 3 days, as well as taking a swab for COVID, Flu, and Strep. They left and called my stateroom phone maybe an hour or two later to tell me what I already knew, that I had COVID. They said to continue to stay put until they had a plan in place to move me to a balcony suite to recover. And they also said to order room service for the remainder of the cruise and that the room service fee's were waived. 

A few hours later and at least a dozen calls from the front desk, medical, and other departments on the ship, I was told that I was about to be moved to my new stateroom and needed to pack up and follow security to my new room. When they knocked, I jumped up, cracked the door and saw the nurse from earlier and she said to come out with my things, and follow some guy in PPE. There was one man in front of me that I began to follow down the hallway, the nurse behind me, and behind her were two or three others, all in PPE, but they were carrying what looked and sounded like something from ghostbusters. It was LOUD, and was spraying some kind of sanitizing spray I assumed, but the device needed to be plugged in every 50 ft or so in the power outlets in the hallway. So every 50 ft, the security guy in front of me would hold up his gloved hand and mutter something, I would stop, and wait until the ghostbuster vacuum thing was unplugged and plugged back in, then I'd follow the security guy once he'd started walking again. We did this 4 or 5 times until we got to a crew-only area and they had me hop onto an elevator and we went up a floor. On the next floor, a new crew of ghostbuster vacuum folks met me and the nurse and security guy and we continued on with them chasing after me with the loud device. Finally, we got to my new balcony room, they opened it and ushered me in and that was it. 

I was in my quarantine stateroom for the rest of the cruise. I had a sore throat for a couple of days, a cough and a little diarrhea. The vaccine must have worked because I really didn't feel terrible. The ship's medical Dr gave me a Z-pack of antibiotics, Robitussin, and acetaminophen 500mg tablets. They offered me Anti-virals but said that my insurance probably wouldn't cover the cost, so I declined. While in Juneau, I used the 4G LTE towers from my balcony to get a teleDoc to send a prescription to a pharmacy in town, then I had a cruiseline agent at the port run to Juneau Drugs and pick up my anti-viral med Paxlovid. So thankful for that, I wish I knew who did this so I could thank/tip them. Pharmacist Adam from Juneau Drugs expedited my order so that I could get it before we left port (Only a 4 hour stay), Thank you Adam!

I got to see a lot from the balcony so I'm thankful for that and for the fresh air. Room service food was okay, not fresh or as hot or cold and I would have liked. I wish I had access to more food and drinks but I was able to find something I liked at each meal. It went by quicker than I originally had thought, I am disappointed that I couldn't do any of the things that I wanted to do, but I'm glad I was quarantined and my family were able to do the excursions we planned and visited the ports we visited. It was incredibly lonely but I had internet to stay in contact and 20 stateroom phone calls a day from different departments or people calling to check in on me daily. 

Our cruise ended in Vancouver, and Canada wanted me to quarantine for 10-days starting on the day we arrived, so instead I decided to be deported to Seattle via a charter bus with 25-30 C-club friends. My family was able to get thru the port authorities and to the Vancouver airport, however they arrived into Seattle much later after my 3 hr bus ride to my hotel. NCL/Canada required me to stay one night in Seattle in Quarantine and they took note of my reservation number for the hotel. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, it just sucked that it happened. 

COVID is really bad now, especially since many are taking off for holidays or vacations. I wore a fresh N95 mask at all the airports and on the planes, used hand sanitizer and washed my hands often. While in Seattle, I did not take off my mask except for eating in non-busy areas and when I was in my hotel room. I did not eat while at the airports or in busy crowded areas. I tested negative 48 hours prior to the cruise. I am vaccinated 3 times for COVID. Did this ruin my view on cruising? Heck no, we love to travel.

Dear Valued Guests and Travel Partners,  


Thank you for your loyalty and choosing Norwegian Cruise Line for your upcoming vacation at sea. We have important information regarding the July 5, 2022 voyage aboard Norwegian Sun. Travel Partners are asked to please share this information with impacted guests.  


During the afternoon of June 25, 2022, Norwegian Sun made contact with ice, while transiting to Hubbard Glacier in Alaska. All guests and crew are safe, and the ship was deemed safe to return to Seattle for further assessment and repairs.  


However, as a precautionary measure, Norwegian Sun's July 5, 2022, sailing has been canceled. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this may cause.  


Due to this unfortunate event, you will receive a full refund that will automatically be returned to the original form of payment provided at the time of your current reservation. No further action is required on your part; your refund will be automatically processed within five business days and will be returned within seven to ten business days from the processed date. The visibility of the funds is dependent on your financial institution's internal policies.  


If your most current reservation was paid via a Future Cruise Credit (FCC), 100% of the FCC used will be re-applied to your Latitudes account. No further action is required; the FCC will be automatically added within seven business days.  


We sincerely appreciate your loyalty, and we cannot wait to provide you with the cruise vacation you've been dreaming about, and likely need now more than ever! Therefore, in addition to the 100% refund or full return of your FCC, you will receive an FCC valued at 50% of the voyage fare paid for your current sailing. The 50% FCC will be applied to your Latitudes account and will be available as of July 8, 2022, for any voyage through December 31, 2023.  


Additionally, we will reimburse any airline-imposed change/cancelation fees up to $300 USD per person. Please submit your receipts for review at [www.ncl.com/case-submission](http://www.ncl.com/case-submission).

Cruise,"We're booked on the Encore in January. Like most people, we have the ""Free Open Bar"" Premium Drinks Package. I mostly drink beer and mixed drinks, so I'm all set, but my wife mostly drinks wine. Looking through the current restaurant and bar menus, the wine choices by the glass are pretty abysmal, and the few wines they have that she likes are not included even though they're pretty cheap wines.  For example, she really likes Matua Sauvignon Blanc, which you can get at Total Wine for $9/bottle.  They have it on board, but they don't offer it by the glass, and it's $37/bottle. So when I started looking at bringing our own bottles of wine, I noticed that after it mentions the $15 corkage fee, it says **""Corkage Fee is not applicable to guest with beverage package.""**

Is that for real - does that mean we can bring a case of wine and not have to pay $180 in corkage fees?  Because that will save us $27/bottle, and she's going to drink a LOT of wine.

If I booked them outright its 400$-ish more for the Premium with alcohol but if this is a package deal where it's just included as it is and can't be changed then it is what it is and I'm still ahead.

We kept our room and 2. There was a Costco group travel discount that could be applied to us, so instead of saving $302 we ended up saving $618!!!

Cruise,"First time cruiser here! My husband and I are planning a delayed honeymoon and have some questions about the Norwegian Haven suites.

1- we found a 5 day cruise to Bermuda in late September‚Ä¶the Haven suites are less than half the cost of the same cruise a month earlier. I‚Äôm guessing this is because it‚Äôs September- colder weather, kids in school, etc. is there anything we‚Äôre missing? (Seems almost too good to be true)

2- other than tipping the butler, are there any costs we might not be thinking of? It looks like the Haven rooms include the ‚Äúfree at sea‚Äù package, does this include things like water and soda as well? Could we eat in the other restaurants onboard, or would we have to pay for the other premium restaurants if we decide to eat there? If we want salmon for breakfast, is that an up-charge?

3- best Haven suites? We‚Äôre looking at the Haven Penthouse Suite with Balcony - looks nice and is the cheapest. Is the Spa Suite worth the couple hundred more? Looks like just access to the spa is the main difference 

4- any other tips and suggestions for the Haven or NCL cruises in general!

Cruise,"So, a couple of weeks ago, my youngest boys and I thought it would be great to go on a cruise. I told them there is one close to us but it usually books at least a year in advance. Then I checked online and found one at a really reasonable price that leaves mid July. We are now booked on a 7 day Holland America cruise (Ms Zuiderdam) out of Vancouver.

After reading reviews I have noticed the average age on this particular cruise is...mature. My boys are not at all the rambunctious types. The younger one is super shy and has already stated concern about being in Club HAL for any length of time. (He will go for 1 hour so I can have a spa treatment, maybe) The older one has aspergers and should have been born in the 40s. He's looking forward to dressing ""classy"" and walking the promenade deck. Neither of them want to be the center of attention.  

If there's anyone here who has been on this cruise, could you let me know if there were kids? Did you bring yours? Is there a library with books for young lads? Are the pools usually busy? If so, when would be the best time for swimming? Anything I should buy beforehand? I won't be drinking, not with boys in tow. They don't like fizzy drinks, cola etc. Will the included restaurants be enough? Any and all advice welcome.

They are off on a long voyage next year (140 nights), and their normal insurance doesn't cover the total cost of the cruise in the event they have to cancel, for whatever reason. They are pretty certain to get cruise credit, but that's a lot of days to make up.

I have found a few places that will provide cancellation top up cover up to 500k(!) per person, which is obviously more than ample, but they are 'under 70' only policies and my dad is 72. Their current options will only meet less than a third of the overall holiday's cost.

So if there's somewhere in the UK that will take their money for appropriate cover, any tips would be great.

Hi everyone. I'm going on my first cruise with my family soon.  Posted once before but I had practically zero information at the time about the ship/itinerary. List of stops is at the bottom.

Got our passports and vaccine cards ready. I'm going to be reviewing the schedule and requirements so we have a better idea of what to expect and hopefully things will go smoothly. 

Do rooms with pull out sofas or daybeds typically have any type of room divider/curtain?

Do we need to sign up for excursions before the trip or is it easy enough to do it while you are there? If there is anything you recommend for specific locations I would be happy to hear them. It seems like the excursions are the best way to get more out of the trip, but at the same time it would be nice to see some places that aren't just tourist traps. Are the Cruise excursions really best or is should we go with a local company? I know the Cruise's excursions would guarantee you get back to the ship on time, but didn't know if there were any benefits besides that. What do they typically do on the excursions?

He has been to the Caribbean and owns a place in Florida that has been great for escaping the cold pre-pandemic but has not seen most of the world and has mentioned in passing that he wished he had. 
This was two years ago, and since then his mobility has drastically declined. He has a walker as well as a cane that he uses but does not need them full time though his ability to stand or walk for longer than 10ish minutes is shaky. 

Last year he decided on a cruise after hearing several great stories from people - he was very much against them for many years.

We would like to find something where the activities on the ship as well as the excursions are geared towards people in the same boat as my dad(pun not intended!).

I've watched countless YouTube videos (tours of the ship, room breakdowns, what there is to do on the ship) but I'm still nervous about what to expect when we're actually on the sea.

Cruise,"Welp this just happened, honeymoon from hell.

We were supposed to arrive in Spain for a 7 day cruise however the flights we booked through Norwegian were delayed causing us to miss the Spain flight this causing us to miss the cruise.

We talked to Norwegian and Air Canada for hours trying to get a flight to a next port to jump on but they literally had nothing they could put us on and eventually sent us home. We talked to Norwegian about 5 times during this and they kept telling us to talk to air Canada ourselves (Norwegian booked our flights so I thought they‚Äôd be more helpful).

Cruise,"Hi all,

I'm planning a cruise to Norway to see the fjords in September with Royal Caribbean on the Anthem of the Seas.

I had some questions regarding the experience as a first time cruiser.

1. If I prepay gratuities, can I reasonably assume tipping won't be expected from me?
2. Where can I clearly access a list of activities available specifically on my ship? I can browse complimentary activites on the website, but they don't specify which ship hosts them (for example the escape room, or the ice rink).
3. To the introverts among you, how enjoyable do you still find cruising? Do you find you can partake in a lot of events without there being huge crowds, or is it really crowded everywhere all the time?
4. How vital do you find a balcony? Having one on RC is a bit out of budget for us, but we ended up favouring it over Princess or P&amp;O because we heard it was the better experience. Would you actually value more a """"""subpar"""""" ship/company with a balcony, or a """"""better"""""" ship/company without one?
5. Any recommendations for cruise insurance? RC recommends Holiday Extras, any experience with them?

Cruise,"First lets look at the positives.

- The ship itself is beautiful. The new blue added to it is gorgeous.

- I know this may be unpopular but Carnival food tastes better than Royal‚Äôs in my opinion (more detail on this later)

- Staff are very helpful and responsive to any issues. 

- Carnival is DEFINITELY a ‚Äúfun‚Äù ship. Parties were really good and very fun.

- Really liked the cruise director (Mel) and her vibrant attitude 

Let‚Äôs look at some negatives

- There was (and I mean) A LOT of snobby people on this ship. They were either yelling, having an attitude, or wondering why the buffet was closed at 3 am.

- LINES, LINES, AND LINES
My god are the lines long. The burger joint on average would take 45 minutes to get a cheeseburger. The pizza is about an 1 hour and 35 minutes. This was because they would serve each customer a pizza made from scratch.

- Going to back my earlier statement, I think Royal is WAY better organized in how they serve the buffet, as on the sunrise, it was a mess. 

- My nephew told me the Teen club (Club O2) was not as good as he expected. As at times it was ‚Äúdry‚Äù. The club next to it though (Circle C) was really lively and sounded really fun.

Overall, it was a good experience with the family. I‚Äôd give it a 7.5/10

Cruising is something we're comfortable with and we know we'll be able to relax and have a good time.

We are planning to purchase the unlimited dining package, drink package, and photo package. Internet comes with the room. We don't think The Key is necessary because of the perks that come with a suite. Plus we've gotten it before and were lukewarm on the experience.

**Here are my questions:**

- We've never been on an Oasis class ship before. Biggest we've been on previously is Independence of the Seas. What are the less obvious differences we need to be prepared for?

- Excursions - the cruise is pretty far out so there are only 5 listed in the cruise planner right now. We're budgeting $175/person/port. Are there any that you've done that you recommend? Is our budget enough to cover your recommendation? 

- The ship will depart Aruba and Curacao at 11:00pm and 10:00pm respectively. We've never been on a cruise that has stayed in port that late. Are there any dinner/night time experiences you would recommend? Or will the upgraded dinners on the ship be better than anything on the islands?

- Coastal Kitchen - Do you recommend eating there instead of MDR or the upgraded restaurants? Is it a good substitute for the windjammer? Does it make the unlimited dining package unnecessary in your opinion?

- What exactly is the concierge service? Is it just a help desk for suites only? How do we get the most out of it?

4. Ability to learn fast and adapt to different systems, apps and technology that may be required on the Ship given a day or two of study/training.

Is our 1st day at sea has about a high of 74, Is 2nd day at sea has about a high of 77. 2 days a port have about the same but with a 30% chance of rain one day. And our last day at sea have a high about 73. Every day has sun but partly cloudy.

Cruise,"Hi everyone,  just got back from the Norwegian Encore after a 7 day Alaskan cruise and had a great time.  I did a lot of research before-hand and learned a lot along the way that might be helpful to others, so I decided to write this seeing all the questions people keep asking. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, packing. Everyone online says pack layers and that's true, but you will use some things more than others. 

&amp;#x200B;

The two MOST important things that you actually want to spend a few bucks on is a nice windbreaker jacket and, i cannot stress this enough, a nice pair of comfortable waterproof hiking shoes. According to my pedometer, we hiked and walked 50 miles that week. When budgeting for clothes, definitely spend the extra money on shoes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, don't forgot sunglasses, bug spray, at least 2 pairs of thermal underwear, a sweater, and at least 1 or 2 pairs of waterproof pants. This stuff you can get crazy cheap on ebay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next step, weed. I see a million questions ""can i bring weed?!"" The answer is no. HOWEVER, as long as you're not a moron they don't give a shit. Don't bring blunts. Don't bring flower.  Bring vape pens or edibles. I literally bought 3 vape pens and just threw them in my backpack with my meds, completely unhidden. No questions asked. Walk right on, they really don't give a shit whatsoever.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, DO NOT smoke in your room. Smoke in the casino (again they don't care), smoking areas, or on your balcony -- but be careful not to send giant clouds of vape smoke off of it constantly. You can also take stuff off at port, BUT NOT WHEN YOU DOCK AT THE END OF THE TRIP. You're technically entering the US from Canada and can get hit with felony drug smuggling, so take only what you can smoke or toss the rest before you leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

This leads to the most important bit of advice i have -- MEN TRAVELING WITH WOMEN, listen carefully. GET. A. BALCONY. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This was our first cruise where we paid for the balcony. Every other cruise i sat in a room with a tiny window or no window at all waiting hours for the wife to get ready. With the balcony i could not care less how long she took. I sat out there for hours by the end of the week and she could've taken as long as she wanted. Best upcharge I've ever spent. Grab a drink and just watch the beautiful scenery.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about glacier bay. It's more money, so people always ask if it's worth it. It's the most beautiful place I've ever seen in my life and is 100% worth it. The beauty almost brought tears to my eyes and it's way different than anything else you'll see on the cruise.  The ship pulls up to the glaciers and does a 360 around them, so another balcony bonus is you don't have to look over and crowd with another 100 people. You have your own private view all day. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's talk about Covid. If you are afraid of covid, do these two things to SUBSTANTIALLY reduce your risk. First of all, avoid the buffet at all costs. They have workers and sinks in the entryways asking everyone to wash their hands as they enter,  but maybe 70-75% actually do. We saw kids coughing straight on the eggs during the first breakfast and immediately left. If you HAVE to buffet, go at odd hours and it's far less risky. NEVER go between 8-9:30 am because it's shoulder to shoulder. Also, if you're really scared of covid, wait like 45 minutes to an hour after they've let people off at port to get off the boat because the lines are long and very cramped.

&amp;#x200B;

Now seasickness. I always get seasick. Ive tried everything. Patches, all the OTC stuff. The first and last day of the cruise will be the worst because you go deeper into the pacific to get there and back home. This time i took some xanax with me. I took .25 mg with breakfast and .25mg with dinner. Didn't get seasick for even a second and the water was ROUGH a couple times. Im not a dr, but if you get seasick talk to your dr and maybe this is an option.

&amp;#x200B;

Last, but not least, food. If you're on norwegian and have the free at sea, in the app theres an add-on for 2 extra premium meals for like $150 total. ABSOLUTELY worth it. Most of the regular dining hall and buffet food was mediocre at best (the dining hall did have some good stuff, but for the most part we thought carnival was a lot better), but the premium restaurants are to die for! We tried Le Bistro, Ocean Blue, And Cagnys. We liked Ocean Blue the most and decided to go there a second time for our last dinner. The mascarpone bread they give you when you sit down is worth it alone. Cagnys was amazing and you cant go wrong there also, but Le Bistro wasn't anything to write home about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thats really all i can think of at this point, but if you have any more questions feel free to ask!

&amp;#x200B;

P.s. you wont have cell service at sea but at most ports you will get a few bars, maybe some 4g.

Edit 1: If you are a poker player like me, dont play in norwegians poker tournaments. They are a ripoff. You start with 2k chips, they make you play 5 handed, and the blinds start at 100/200, so zero skill is actually involved and its basically a lotto ticket.


Edit 2: BRING YOUR OWN TYLENOL/IBUPROFEN. I also brought Tums. They don't sell medicine on the ship anymore because they want you to go to med bay if you don't feel well.


Edit 3: I also recommend a bottle of glasses defogger solution if you wear glasses / sunglasses.  Worked wonders for me.",Ultimate Alaskan Cruise Guide,,xXxHondoxXx,,35,2022-06-17 17:59:35
Cruise," 

Hi,

My partner and I are considering what we think is a pretty good deal for an NCL Free at Sea cruise, 5 days RT from NYC to Bermuda. This includes an inside stateroom with all the gratuities/fees included, as far as I can tell. We live in NYC, so the $1400 grand total is great, considering we don't need to fly. I've seen lots of cautions on this sub about free at sea, but by-and-large it seems like people either chose sail away when they thought they got free at sea, or they aren't actually going to drink that much. My partner and I love to drink, we sort of see this as a potential 5-day booze cruise lol. And if you break it down, $140/day per person is something we'd easily spend eating and drinking in New York, even at our cheap dives. It just seems too good to be true haha. I've read the terms and conditions, and I recognize there's some premium drinks we wouldn't get, but it seems like open bar does mean beer, wine, spirits, but let me know if I'm wrong!

So my question is, given our ""ability"" to take advantage of an open bar, is this actually as good a deal as I think? If i select Free at Sea in my package, is there some hidden way it might not be that, even when the price details list that cost and the gratuity? I know coffee and lots of other non-alcoholic drinks aren't included, but does ""open bar"" really just mean bud lights or cheap wine at one bar on the ship that you need to wait 20 minutes in a line for? Or is it truly a pretty inclusive detail, assuming we'll spend most of our time lounging on the deck with a pina coloda or something. I'm a pretty skeptical person and it seems like these deals really are BS most of the time, but I'm wondering if we are simply the right people to take advantage haha.

Cruise,"So I get Friends and Family discount on HAL thanks to a relative, and I'm planning a big cruise next summer with my kids. By that time they'll be 14, 15 and 17 (insert parental shock here). Our son is the eldest, and two daughters.   


So for us and our financial situation, this'll be kind of a once in a lifetime trip, and I'm strategizing how to stretch finances. I don't think, if we avail of the F&amp;F discount, that there's any discount on kids. So one idea I had was to get balcony for my wife and I and a window stateroom for the 3 kids.  


I don't know how relevant it is, but as of now I'm looking at a 12-day Med cruise. The kids homeschool so we have some flexibility.   


So I guess I'm asking whether anyone has done something like this, is there another option that makes more sense? My thought is by breaking up the room categories, they won't just cram all 5 of us into one stateroom (since we're paying for 5 pax anyway) and the balcony for the parents also enables one of the kids to have an extra space to crash and have a bit more space. Might even decide that giving the kids the balcony and we take the window is preferable. Help me think through pros and cons and ... whatever else I'm not thinking about.

Carnival seems to be the party boat while RC seems to be a bit stuffy. I‚Äôm not sure what to choose.

I‚Äôm sailing out of Port Canaveral, most likely for a 5 night cruise. Was planning on 4 but a lot of feedback suggesting a little longer trip is better. I do like the options offered at CocoCay, which is the RC private island, and overall the port stops seem more interesting to me with RC but I‚Äôm afraid the actual ship would be boring. 

RC 5 day would be Cozumel and CocoCay on the Mariner.

Carnival 5 day would be Nassau, Princess Cays, Grand Turk or
Amber Cove, Grand Turk on the Freedom.

Cruise,"I wrote this on a note file on my phone as we went through the cruise, so it's not too organized.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  :)

Previous cruises we have been on: NCL Dawn (2300 capacity) to Western Caribbean, RC Adventure of the Seas (3800 capacity) to Eastern Caribbean, NCL Gem (2400 capacity) to Mexican Riviera, Viking Mariella (2500 capacity) from Stockholm to Helsinki.

This cruise: 3400 passengers, 4000 capacity (and 2000 crew).

Boarding was simple and easy, although you need lots of documents, so have them out.

Almost no passengers are wearing masks, although a few are and all crew are.

Observation lounge is nice but not nearly enough seats for everyone. Approx 400 total seats.

Same basic venues on board in center three decks as smaller ships.  The theater and atrium are smaller than on ships with fewer passengers, so you have to get there early to get a seat.

Three outlets in room (vs only one or two on some other ships) is really nice. Also USB plugs in lights by beds so can have phones close to you while you sleep.  Upper brighter light and lower reading light by bed on both sides is helpful.

Hate having to put card in slot by door to turn on room lights. Too easy to forget when you leave room. But can use any card (membership card, insurance card, etc), not just your room card.

You can create but not cancel go-gart, laser tag, comedian reservations at kiosks by elevators.  To cancel, you have to go to the box office when they're open.  When we first got on the ship, we ran to The Social to book these, although they didn't seem to fill up too much.

Cristal champagne is not worth double the price of¬†Dom Perignon. I actually preferred Dom; my wife and sister simply said they were different (Cristal more spring, Dom more fall), but both are much, much better than the free or cheap stuff.

Bring: magnet hooks (to hang clothes on walls), shoe holder, portable bidet, multiplug (not needed on this ship), something to hang on your outside cabin door so you can spot it easily.

According to the wife, the conditioner is not so good, but the hair dryer was good.

Some central port rooms shook constantly. From at least floor 9 to floor 17 (maybe more). We heard a propellor was bent.  It didn't slow us down and it was fixed after two days, but it was really annoying being anywhere on that side of the ship for those two days; I couldn't have imagined trying to sleep through it.

Many evening shows and events were in the atrium.  There was little seating and it hard to hear due to horrible acoustics in a very open area.  The shows on other ships were in theaters or other enclosed rooms which were much better.

The gym was decent with often beautiful views, although there was no Angry Birds on treadmills.  It wasn't too busy.

There were no red fish swimming backwards on carpet like some other NCL ships.

Disembarkation at Juneau: horrible clusterfuck. I understand they're trying to squeeze 3500 people through one or two holes, but the only announcement was don't go stand in line. Even so, there were long lines on multiple decks with no official organization of any kind. We were in line on floor 6 at 1445, off the ship at 1515, on our tour bus at 1525, and the bus left at 1535.  Lots of people missed their excursions, even official ones through NCL.

Skagway we got off about 30 minutes after disembarkation, and there was no line; maybe there would have been if we had gotten in line earlier?  Ketchikan was the opposite; we got in line very early because we had a non-official excursion and didn't want to miss it.  We disembarked at 640 (scheduled for 700) and were on the first bus into town; no idea how later people fared.

In other cruises, they were more organized.  They disembarked those with excursions first, or by boarding group, or had better announcements.

Tuesday was busy for Juneau, five cruise ships docked today (seven last week).  The small shops probably depend on cruise passengers.

The laundry bag is super thin and tears too easily. It's also really expensive.  Normally I wouldn't do laundry on a ship because of this, but we were in Seattle a few days before the cruise and I ran a bit in the rain to get places, so the pants I was planning on wearing for 3 days or so each were already stinky when we got on the cruise (I was considering going to go to a laundromat before the cruise, but we were staying at the Marriott Waterfront, and there weren't any laundromats very close).  Also, we left a bag of laundry in the morning on day 5, and and that evening we got a note in the Freestyle Daily about a full bag of laundry for $29.  Thankfully, they still only charged us the full bag price and not the itemized price (even though that would only have been a few dollars more), but if I had know that, I would have placed a few more items in there. That's probably why the bags are so thin; so people don't jam too much in there.

We couldn't find any outside view from the front of ship except for Vibe Beach Club, which is paid access. There is on deck 8 during the four hours at Glacier Bay, but they close that the rest of the cruise. The inside observation deck has windows, so you get reflections even if hold a camera lens directly onto the window. The buffett is above and behind observation deck, so looking through two sets of windows from that. An outside area at the rear of ship is behind laser tag on 17 or on 8 behind restaurants.  This was really annoying as we like to be able to see everything unobstructed.

Announcements were much more quiet than on other cruises; you had to open your door to hear anything.  It's nice if you're trying to sleep, but it's horrible if you're trying to hear what's going on, or if you miss something important.

All of the kids stuff is on a single deck, 5, which was nice.

We didn't get much sleep. We went to bed around 11pm after dancing and got up around 4am when sun rises, around five hours of sleep versus our usual eight. Even with the curtain closed, the light still got through the balcony window in the morning. We usually took a nap and had sex in the afternoon, but that only lasted about an hour (the nap, not the sex). One of the benefits of an inside room is it stays dark in the morning, but the benefit of the balcony in Alaska outweighs that, I think, so you don't have to fight for spots in the observation deck.

There was no announcement for whales, etc. I don't know of any cruise ship that does, but they should. For example, the Monterey Aquarium does. In fact, if any ship did, I'd definitely choose it over others. We missed a ton of whales and even some orcas that other passengers saw. Maybe we should have formed an informal watch where if you see something, you yell it out your window? We did that to let our neighbors know a few times, but it didn't really catch on.

Glacier Bay was just OK. Everyone online hyped it up a ton, but it's just a bunch of snow. Maybe it wasn't as interesting for us because we grew up in snow? We saw four glaciers.  I think the view of them from above is really cool from photos we saw online, but from straight ahead, rather meh.

When we originally booked this Alaska cruise, we decided to get two balconies across from each other right beside the elevators / stairs so if someone on one side of the ship sees something neat in Glacier Bay, they can call the other room and those people can run across and see it, too. It worked quite well. We saw lots of otters, a few whales, and even a leopard seal and her pup on a small floating piece of ice.

Bring layers, but more importantly, check the hourly weather at each port and only bring what you'll likely need. You don't need to carry a coat, snow pants, and a rain jacket into town if it's going to be 70 from when you arrive to when you depart and there is 0% chance of rain.  It was surprisingly warm each day in Alaska.

I wish the buffet was open a bit earlier for dinner. It opens at 5pm, but we almost always had events to go to starting at 5pm and then throughout the rest of the evening. Even at 4pm would be good.

When you leave the ship, they only scan your face for identification. But when you come back on, you must show your room card and photo ID. What if you don't bring those when leaving?

Medenhall glacier and tram were OK, nothing too special.

Skagway photo tour was OK (we didn't do the train because we've done lots of trains in the continental US and we wanted to stop for pictures, although the people on the train saw a bear). The town of Skagway was decent.  We happened across the The Days of '98 Show when some of the performers were advertising it from the windows; it was fun.

Snorkeling in Ketchikan was amazing.  They had 7mm wetsuits with hoods, gloves, and boots, so we weren't cold at all, and we saw a ton of different animals.  It might be our favorite snorkeling excursion, even better than the Caribbean and Mexican ones.

We got to Victoria, BC even later than planned. We went to the Butchart Gardens, but it was already dark and kind of rainy.  Interestingly, this was the coldest, wettest day of the entire trip.  The flowers had some lights, but it was still rather hard to see much, and we didn't have much time, so even walking quickly, we still didn't see everything.  The bus driver did a nice tour of parts of the city before and after the gardens.

The towns were too touristy. In the Caribbean and Mexico, we could get away from the cruise area and walk around for a few miles in the authentic parts of town where there's better food and you can see how people really live. In Alaska ports, the town configurations didn't seem good for that and there wasn't much away from the tourist areas.

The Galaxy Pavilion VR was awesome, although a few people got a little dizzy / sick for a bit after some of the games.

Go Karts were OK.  Everyone goes about the same speed so there's not much of a race; you just kind of stay in the same configuartion most of the race.  One kid kept bumping everyone and they didn't do anything about it.

Laser Tag was pretty fun, although that was mostly the women laughing that they killed us men so quickly.  It's outdoors, which is a bit weird.  We were supposed to do it the first day, but it was somewhat misty.  We showed up a bit before our time, but nobody was even manning the booth, and there was no communication to us that it was canceled.

Magician Joseph Reohm was OK.  The comedians were OK.  Kinky Boots and Choir of Man were wonderful.

High-speed paid internet was around 1.5 Mbps at open sea; basic internet was around 0.7 Mbps.  Sometimes a bit more or less, but not too much variation.  What location of the ship didn't seem to matter; it was all about the same (we walked front to back and took speed tests a few days to see if anywhere was better).  My wife and sister were able to video conference for work, although sometimes it dropped, and uploading large database files took forever.

I was getting a bit tired of the buffet by end of trip, especially breakfast. It felt like I had eaten everything once or twice.  I've always loved the buffets, one of the highlight of cruises for me, but this one just seemed a bit repetitive, even with a different main item at the carving station each night.  Also the Manahattan Room, Taste, and Savor all have same menu, so there wasn't any variety between them.  The Local had a different menu but also didn't change (much?) day to day. We didn't like Le Bistro much; rather blah.  Cagney's Steakhouse was much better.  We each gained around 7 pounds (at home, we usually skip lunch).

Favorite part of cruise for each of us: Cristal champagne (sister), snorkeling (me), baby seal (mom), buffet (dad), all of us laughing at the absurdity of going to Butchart Gardens at midnight in the dark and rain (wife).

While we liked the cruise, and a few small things were amazing, it didn't seem quite as good as other cruises, especially because of the smaller venues and not being able to find seats in the atrium for the evening shows.  It felt like more work to get to activities, whereas on other cruises we could just show up whenever.  Same with having to fit dinner into the other evening events; there didn't seem to be as much variety of dining options a bit earlier or later as on other ships, so you had to plan it out more.  Same with gokarts and laser tag.  Everything felt more restricted on this one, whereas what we love about cruising is the freedom to do whatever we want whenever we want on the ship.  Plus the big day the entire cruise is built around, Glacier Bay, was a bit of a letdown for us.  Although maybe a lack of sleep the entire week contributed as well.

Next cruise: I think we're done for a while. We've hit the major destinations that are easy to reach from the US, and anything else is going to be longer or in Europe, etc. Also, with a cruise, each port stop is so short. That's fine if there isn't much to do in a given location, but in a lot of places, that isn't enough time to hit everything.

For example, on our cruise that stopped in Puerto Rico, we only had time to walk around Old San Juan. But when I flew there for a few days, I did Old San Juan in addition to also driving to the¬†Bacardi Factory, bioluminescent kayaking, the rainforest and some waterfalls, Rio Camuy caverns, and Arecibo Observatory. There's no time to do all of those on a single cruise stop.

Same when we went to Oahu, Hawaii for four days. We would have missed out on so many things if we had only been there a day via a cruise, especially hiking to sunrise and sunset locations. So I think our next vacations are going to be visiting the other Hawaiian islands for around four days each, and we're going to wait on more cruises until we have more free time and/or move to Florida or Europe.",NCL Encore to Alaska on 5/29/22 thoughts,,jonovan,,6,2022-06-15 04:31:45

The rooms are currently booked with the other woman and her kids in a room and myself, daughter, and the two family friends in a room. The other woman wants me to switch rooms with her daughter. This way, all four teenage girls would be in a room and the moms would be with the teenage boys. 

Will Royal Caribbean allow this? The entire reason I was invited was to be the adult in the room (over age 21). If we switch rooms and the girls are caught without an adult, are we all in trouble? What could happen in that scenario?

I believe the cruise industry, like many others, is allowed to go as low as 75%, and the general impression is that cruises are about the only place which does indeed take full advantage of that (captive audience and all).

75% would make it nearly impossible to have even a single winning session of more than 30 minutes (apart from hitting an outsized win/jackpot).  Whereas ~90% would allow for the occasional winning session.

I understand that even the 90% would make it almost a guarantee for an overall loss on the trip, but if the journey to that loss is just never-ending pain (75%), it loses appeal for me.

I'm in my early 20s, so I'm wondering if I would fit in with the population on-board or not. Especially since I'm alone, and don't have anyone I know to regroup with.

My wife and I are experienced cruisers.  We have booked back-to-back Rhine / Viking and North Sea / Azamara cruises in late July through August.   These were arranged long ago when it looked like Covid and accompanying restrictions might ease off.  They haven't.  Not only is there a whole new layer of vaccination and recent test paperwork and documentation added to what was always there for travel, but we keep hearing stories of people quarantined in hotels and trip ruined.  Even if not infected, having to wear masks always and everywhere and living with the prospect that your daily Covid test will be positive is sure to impact enjoyment of the trip.  Most recently, there are stories of horrible delays at airports too.  

We are fully vaccinated and boosted, and still wear masks indoors when out in our community, so it is not as if we cannot meet requirements, but do we want to?  Over half of our arrangements can be cancelled at no cost, or worst case stick us with airline credits; the remaining penalties will be manageable.

Cruise,"I‚Äôve booked several cruises through VacationstoGo.com and always had a good experience. But this time was outstanding.   

Booked for the Norwegian Encore from Seattle to Alaska Oct 16. The last time I sailed I had a problem with the balcony door which led to a visit from maintenance at midnight and involved a whole lot of Duct tape. Long story short, no balcony for the last 2 days‚Ä¶but I had a nice cruise credit. Norwegian was very accommodating and I am a cruiser with them for life.  

This thing is, when I booked, I forgot the payment balance was due yesterday and missed the email notification due to being in an area with zero reception. It was totally my fault. I called in pretty much as they were literally closing and the receptionist said she‚Äôd try to reach somebody still in the building and took my number. I figured, great, so much for that cruise.     

Half an hour later I got a call from one of the managers, Ringo. He took the payment but noticed there was an issue with the cruise credit. I sent him a copy of the letter and he said he‚Äôd get back to me. Again, I expected a call on Monday.   

Well, this morning I got a surprise call‚Ä¶on a Saturday. Not only had he sorted the cruise credit out with Norwegian, but he‚Äôd got me the cruise for $695 LESS. üò≥üòÉ.

Very mild symptoms, my Dr. says I will be fine in a few days to a week at most. According to the NCL Sail-Safe website, as long as my Dr. clears me and I receive a letter that I have recovered (no syptoms, and completed isolation) at least 10 days before embarkation then I will be allowed on board and also exempt from the 3-day test rule. 

We were allowed to start our online check in process today and the ""Health &amp; Safety"" step ONLY acknowledges being able to board with a negative test, and if I cannot provide proof of that test then I will have to pay to test at the port before boarding.

Cruise,"About a month ago, I woke up one day and thought about cruises. I'd never been on one, but I was getting my passport paperwork figured out and said ""oh that would make a cruise easier."" From there, that was it.

In that time, I have watched quite a few videos, but nothing very specific to RCL, or the ship outside a walkthrough of what is where and a deck map.

Today, after mulling it for a week and a half, I called my agent(turns out I had a family friend who is an agent), and got it worked out. I will be in a Studio Cabin, as this is my first one, it's only a few nights, and I plan on being drunk in the casino or bar or poolside for the majority of it. I also am able to sleep almost anywhere, so noise and what not isnt an issue for me.

Anyone used to RCL, or who has been on Adventure of the Seas, or just has some good advice, I would greatly appreciate. Drink package pro/con, whether to look at specialty dining multiple times or just trying one or two, really any and all advice is welcome. Had a friend who's best advice was ""Don't get addicted"" but, some pun intended, that ship has sailed. I am so intrigued by all of this.

For reference, late 20s male with no cruising experience, no real solo trip experience, so yea. I am a lost puppy that hasn't been this excited since, well sadly, I don't know the last time I looked forward to something as much as this. I'm very personable and have no problem interacting with people. Also looking forward to hopefully karaoke a night or two on board.

I am currently a junior in high school and my class is preparing for the senior trip in Spring 2023.  We are a class of 24 students and our ages will be 17-19. Our school's budget is no more than $850 per student, and we wanted to go on a cruise if possible. There is no minimum or maximum days for the trip as long as it fits our school budget to be inclusive of every student. We can not leave the US as some students are non-citizens or can not leave the country without special permits. Not even Canada. Please give suggestions on what cruises we can go on! Also, we can only depart from ports in Midwest like Chicago or Duluth for cost purposes. Or maybe Seattle. Unless there is a trip that covers or discounts travel costs to other ports.

As an addition based on the comments received, we have 10 teachers going with us as well as 2 translators. Parents are welcome on the trip as well, but have to pay out of pocket. We agreed as a class that this is not a party kind of trip, more for the experience and getting along as well as having fun.

We are open to other suggestions for a trip within our budget. If you have any other trip suggestions, please comment!

Generally, the consensus seemed to be that it was usable, at least on the newer (Oasis in my class) ships with the O3b satellites. 

Just adding my data point here, incase someone else is considering doing this, and since it seems to go against the general consensus for this class ship.  The internet has been absolute crap on my ship (Harmony of the seas).  Large periods of no access at all, once in a while (like right now) you will get 56kps crap connection.  I have been past the voom desk and several people were clamoring for refunds.  So be warned if you are also considering this, the internet is very unstable.

Edit: 8 hr later and the internet seems to be more stable now. May have been due to the inclement weather, but also overheard the voom guy saying something about the antenna crapping out.

Edit2: Internet seems to have degraded again.  Regularly seeing pings of 1000-1200 ms and down speeds 0.3-0.5 mbps on speedtest.

Cruise,"Hi y'all. I obtained my Green Card through Asylum Status from Venezuela, meaning I can't renew my home country passport (Expired in April, and per the US they will continue to accept it for 5 more years); if I wanted to travel to another country I would have to obtain a Refugee Travel Document which only lasts for 1 year and it might take about a year to be completed, and let's keep in mind that NOT all countries accept it.

Before booking our cruise I contacted Royal Caribbean as their website states that a Permanent Resident requires the Green Card to cruise, ""and a passport from your home country is strongly recommended""  **(but not required)** which I found odd, I spoke to a nice gentlemen on the phone (His name is Jim :), very nice guy honestly) and he said that what the website says is correct, I will only need my green card to cruise, they won't be asking me for a passport or any other form of ID.

We are traveling in the Jewel of the Seas to the ABC Islands on November 19 from Port Canaveral, it will be our first cruise (Boyfriend is American citizen, he's good with his passport), and the closer we get to this date, the more nervous I get, even though the gentlemen stated I don't need my passport, it scares me that they would find a way to mess me up and not allowing me to travel..

Has any of you cruised as a Green Card Holder? Do you know anyone who has? What has been the experience?

PS: I decided not to request the Travel Document as based on the timeline, the document won't arrive on time, I speak from experience, as it took over 3 years to obtain my Green Card when the timeline was ""8 months"" when submitted.

They do say that the cruise ships could move terminals at any time.  So, it wouldn't make sense to reserve a spot at a terminal when you could in fact be moved to a different one.

Have they ever turned people away though for lack of space?  I would think that the folks who had just gotten off the ship would have left by the time we need to park, so I'm assuming this would never be an issue.

We are planning on cruising with NCL, so I‚Äôve been doing some research on their protocols and have a few questions.

I was looking on here for information about covid testing, and I saw one comment that said you should keep in mind that people may fake test results, and I‚Äôm also considering the same for the actual vaccine cards as well. So my question is this- does NCL verify the validity of covid tests and vaccination status? What is the procedure for presenting proof of a negative test/vaccination cards? Is it just shown to an employee or do you submit the documentation for review? Essentially I‚Äôm asking if it‚Äôs likely that they may have slack guidelines that people might take advantage of. 

I don‚Äôt want to take my at-risk family on a cruise that could be potentially full of unvaccinated people or people carrying covid.

I'm still not going to book with Princess again because the drastic itinerary change was unforgivable. But we still had a ton of fun on the ship. I didn't notice a sewage smell, the food was great and the staff were all Rockstars. There was a ""rattle"" at the back of the boat but we didn't mind it as much as other guests.


 We noticed a lot of guests were in a shit mood and we didn't want to be like them.

-Maybe this isn't the best place for this question, but I'll ask anyways since it's related. What are the chances that we'll still be testing positive on our date of disembarking?

-What kind of test is administrated at the port if you don't take a test before arriving? I know they make you pay for it, but if it's a rapid test they give you I feel confident we'll test negative since those aren't as sensitive as the PRC tests they want you to get before arriving at port. I can't imagine they would be giving anything other than rapid tests at the port since lab tests take a few days for results, and that would be useless if the ship is leaving a few hours after the test is given.

-Is there anything we can do to prove to NCL that we are  only testing positive because we're in recovery? I saw on their website something about getting a doctors note, but it also said something about a minimum of 10 days before disembarking, and we're under that minimum now. Is there anything else we can do in that regard?

To start, security going in was a total joke for the most part. The same as airport security. I threw two Raw gardens into my girlfriends carry on, and stuck the battery in a suit case. had a few vapes as well, We walked in with no issues or questions to it, even with the multiple signs for no cbd or weed products.

And now for the part that everyone made a big fuss about. US customs  was an even bigger joke. All they did was scan my face and i walked through like nothing, not even a metal detector. although i did take tips form online and tossed my carts before i left. While in the bahamas customs/security was even more of a joke, there was none, u just walked off the boat and walked back on through a metal detector. We didn‚Äôt bring any of the carts with us off the boat, but i feel it ws very possible and quite easy if i wanted to. The only questions they asked was to my brother ‚Äúdid you buy anything overseas‚Äù and with a quick ‚Äúno‚Äù he moved on with the $5000 omega watch he just bought on the ship and the box in his bag, he would‚Äôve had to pay taxes for it.

First time posting here. My mother is arranging a 9 day Alaskan cruise on Holland America this August. It will be a Sea/Land combination with a 3/4 day cruise and the rest will be done over land via train and bus. I‚Äôm more interested in relaxing on the ship and soaking in scenery while dining on a steak while mom is more interested in immersing in nature. 3 days also doesn‚Äôt seem anywhere near sufficient to enjoy the ship‚Äôs amenities. 

Frankly I have my concerns. First off, I was hoping to focus mostly on cruising as opposed to constantly moving from one location to another. I‚Äôm also not thrilled to be spending most of the day traveling on a cramped bus or train. We‚Äôre also apparently on our own in Fairbanks and Anchorage from which I hear aren‚Äôt particularly exciting places.

This is our first true family vacation since pre covid and likely our last one for a while since I‚Äôll be increasingly busy with my career and general ‚Äúadulting‚Äù. Im 27 trying to get my life underway and finally leave home.

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has advice on how to secure your belongings when in port, specifically on the beach while swimming or snorkeling.  I plan on having my phone, cards and cash on me but will still have a bag with me.  I considered just asking nice-looking fellow beachgoers to keep an eye on it, would that be weird?

Well in one video they were showing buffet items and I noticed on Indian cuisine night they had mango lassi which is a drink and on another night they served several types of smoothies. So now I'm confused are those drinks free or do you have to pay for them? Then I stumbled across the MSC cruise line and I saw them serving sangria near the buffet just out in the open in a punch bowl and it seemed to be free.

Cruise,"This one caught my eye while I was browsing through all the various cruise line sites. Main details:

* going solo

* $1822 CAD for 10 nights

* starts in Vancouver, stops in San Fran, San Diego, LA, Santa Barbara, and 5 days at seas total before returning to Vancouver

* opted for including Princess Plus as I would like some drinks as well as wifi

* September 26 - October 2

I'm curious mainly about what I can expect the age range for fellow passengers to be. I went solo a few years back on my own with Holland America and I think I saw like 7 people in my age range for the whole thing. I'm fairly certain from the research I've done that Princess attracts people closer to my age (29 years old) but also towards families. I'm just wondering if that holds true for a late Fall cruise. 

I believe I've read as well that Princess is bigger in comparison to HA. Kinda wondering a bit if people could speak in any regards to that. I'm aware from looking things up that I should expect more food options at least as well as more activity options as a whole. I'm fairly game for that as I did find myself somewhat bored on HA. 

Any feedback or comments are appreciated. I'm mainly looking to take a good break from work and make some friends on board this time around. I didn't hate my HA experience but I recognized I kinda looked like a fish out of water there.

Cruise,"I just got off a week-long cruise where I learned, via the Facebook group for the cruise, that at least one person was ***shocked*** that people were catching COVID immediately after the cruise. Yes, shocked!

I don't know what sort of rock she was living under to not realize that if you go on a cruise, or travel anywhere on vacation, or hell even if you leave the house, you can get COVID. If you are super-concerned you should wear a N95 mask and probably not go on a cruise.

I'm not sure if she assumed that since people were vaccinated and tested it would be completely safe, but you can test 2 days before the cruise so there's plenty of time to catch it. Or someone could have a false negative. Or maybe they're at the beginning of the illness and not quite sick enough for it to register on a test yet. Or you could pick it up at a port. Or traveling to and from the cruise. 

So for the hopefully only one or two other people that are totally unaware that COVID still exists: COVID still exists. It is not unusual for 2-5% of the people on a cruise to get it either on the cruise or immediately after returning. If you're really concerned, you could wear a mask all the time (though don't expect everyone else to be wearing one if it's not required) or, hey, not go on a cruise if you're dead set on having no risk of COVID.","Guys, COVID still exists and even with vaccinations and tests you can get it on a cruise",,rabidstoat,,59,2022-06-02 22:08:53

Is it safe to be solo on a cruise especially as a woman? My mother is convinced I‚Äôm going to be sexually assaulted/murdered/go missing. It‚Äôs an ongoing issue, as I‚Äôm in my 20s, have my own money from work and would like to travel, but she doesn‚Äôt want me to go anywhere alone, or at night, and wants me to be in official tour groups if I go anywhere (when I asked if she‚Äôd help me pay for these tours she said no- sounds like a her problem).

Her other main argument is I need to save for nursing school down the road, which I understand, but when I will have a loan of around 35k for nursing school (it‚Äôs a 2 year accelerated BSN) I don‚Äôt think 1500 for a cruise will break the bank so to speak. I make around 1200-1700 a month depending on work hours and my undergrad classes, plus I try to take on as many hours as possible in the summer.

I‚Äôm very rational in public, no drinking, no racy clothes, no flashing valuables, I‚Äôd be staying with official groups if I did want to do tours, etc.

How can I convince my mother that at some point I will need to take the plunge into solo travelling as a practicality?

Cruise,"So this has been a multi-year ""adventure"".  My wife and I booked a cruise along with our close and extended family.  Since our family is spread out we opted to go with a travel agent, specifically a friend of one of our family members (we usually book everything on our own).  Long story short, the original cruise was in early 2020, so that got cancelled, and we got our Future Cruise Credit.  We all decided to go on a cruise in 2021, but then Delta happened and about half of our family members wanted to push the cruise back to 2022 and the other half just wanted to cancel the whole thing.

&amp;nbsp;

My wife and I opted to book a 2022 cruise, using the Future Cruise Credit (this is all through Royal Caribbean btw), and in the spirit of throwing budgets to the wind we opted to go on a much nicer cruise.  At this time the travel agent was more than thrilled.  Then the wheels fell off and all of our family members decided to cancel going on any current/future cruise.  From what I heard from an in-law, the travel agent was pretty irritated after all the work he did.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, we figured it didn't matter since we are still going through him with our cruise, but two weeks until final payment (something we've been saving up for for over a year) he has completely either ghosted us or given us the runaround.  We gave him our credit card information two weeks ago but nothing has posted on our account.  Since our last correspondence two weeks ago he has been radio silent.

&amp;nbsp;

We called Royal Caribbean but they said we need to continue trying our travel agent (we might have just got a bad rep).  Not sure what our options are at this point.  I figured we'd try calling Royal Caribbean again, but maybe you guys have some additional suggestions.  Thankfully we still have two weeks, but I'm going to go ahead and assume our travel agent is slighting us because 20+ of our family members abruptly cancelled on him.",Travel Agent went AWOL right before final payment,,AndyInAtlanta,,34,2022-06-02 18:05:26

Cruise,"Hi everyone. My wife and I are booking some excursions for our upcoming Med Cruise. We are sailing with NCL. While looking at the excursions for the various ports, we are wondering something that we see on a number of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The excursion time will say, for instance, 4 hours. In the description, it will mention a tour, stopping to take pictures, etc and then also says ""enjoy some free time"". Are we correct in assuming that the free time is included within the 4 hour timeframe of the excursion? Here is a description of one:

&amp;#x200B;

 

Kotor and Perast, two towns where history, culture and traditions are well preserved. Two magical places nestled in the Bay of Kotor. The little town of Perast is situated at the foot of St. Elijah Hill, opposite the narrow Verige strait. Despite its size, it has a sophisticated urban structure. A great number of public buildings line the waterfront. Follow your guide along the seaside and get a unique perspective of the best preserved baroque town on the Adriatic coast, with views towards the two church islands St. George and Our Lady of the Rock.

The center of the town is an amazing sight thanks to the huge proportions of the cathedral of St. Nicholas. Enjoy free time to take a stroll or enjoy the views from the waterfront. Return to Kotor and visit the historical center of a town fortified by 3 mile long walls (4.5 km) and strongly shaped by the presence of the Venetians for almost 400 years. Witness a mosaic of art styles in architecture, visible on its historical buildings. It has a great number of medieval monuments, complemented by narrow streets, squares and markets. You‚Äôll also find a great number of boutiques and trade shops. As well as some smaller shops, cafes and restaurants. After an orientation tour, enjoy some free time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am assuming the free time is included within the 4 hour time frame for the excursion. Would that be correct? We are in Kotor from 1-7pm. The excursion booking time as for 2pm so I am thinking if we wanted, we could get off the ship earlier and poke around before meeting for the excursion and/or stay in Kotor after the excursion is complete, as long as we are back on the ship in time to leave.

Any thoughts?

Cruise,"So, my husband and I brought our family on a family vacation on Norwegian in December. I surprised him with a cruise for just the two of us coming up quickly on RCCL on June 12. I only booked it a few days ago and it was kind of an impulsive thing after finding out I didn't have breast cancer! (yay!)

Anyway, I'm a little concerned after reading some of the reviews on here. We were once loyal Carnival cruisers but had a cruise that was so bad we refuse to go back with them. (It was on the Triumph, before it had it's situation but not long before and we had serious issues handled abysmally by Carnival -- sewage exploded into our stateroom and our air conditioning stopped working). 

Anyway, we tried Norwegian and the service was beyond excellent, we were Haven guests though so it was probably exceptional because of that. We didn't care for the freestyle dining and ended up at the buffet with our kids most nights.

I'm really hoping that our experience is going to be better than some recent posts indicate. We do have a suite booked, so that should be nice, but beyond that has anyone experienced Liberty of the Seas and give any insight? 

Any tips on having the best experience we can on RCCL? We're definitely not super picky just hoping to have a lovely, romantic cruise with some excellent food and times. 

Also can you preorder any services for ""gifts"" in the cabin the first day? I'd love to have a nice bottle of wine and some munchies delivered to the stateroom as a surprise for my husband. We're trying to make up for a few years we missed celebrating anniversaries etc lol.

I‚Äôve never been on a ship like the Oasis before. I‚Äôve typically been on older ships that were quite a bit smaller.

So I call and they tell me it's applied.

I didn't check my reciepts at the time but eventually see they gave me just one of the credits (250) and they didn't apply it as a payment but rather a guest fare reduction....reducing one passengers fare from 1000 to 750, and the other staying at 1000.

In March I see that there are massive reductions in my cruises price dropping the price for a similar room from 2000 total to 1250 total. I call in and they reduce my total fare approximately 500 more. As I am at work lunch break I just thank them for the price reduction and decide to look at all my reciepts as I realize something is off.

I look at all the reciepts and see that one FCC for 250 never applied. I also notice that the first credit was applied as a discount rather than a credit and it took effect before the price match phone call I did (pre-final payment and more than 90 days out).

I call and ask for the credits. They claim both were applied but as invisible discounts that only they can see on their systems. I explain it all and they say no our system says you got it so tough luck. So I ask who can I contact. They send me online to fill out a form.

30 days later no response. I submit complaints through the BBB and FMC to assist. 15 or so days later someone at the office of the VP for consumer services reaches out and after 3 emails of proving that I haven't received 1/2 the credits and that the other one I'm effectively 'losing' because it's being applied prior to the price match rather than after they're telling me oh well. 

I'm not asking for a refund and I do not want a credit for a future cruise. I offered and was willing to take a room upgrade worth the $500 I'm missing and they are declining me.

Anyone had/having similar issues or have any advice? I wish I never took the 25% and NCL has been terrible to work with over this issue.",Norwegian Cruise Line potentially trying to screw me out of the FCCs promised to me.,,BkEnigma,,6,2022-05-29 02:46:51

Cruise,"Just wanted to share some thoughts/a review of my very first cruise (ever). We had a wonderful time overall but we had quite of a bit of bad luck too (missed 2 out of our 4 destinations which I'll describe below) but first!

**The good** this ship was gorgeous! Everything was spotless. We had a regular balcony room and I was impressed with how large the rooms were, there was plenty of space for the two of us and lots of storage.

The service! The waiters in the main dining room were top notch. I might not have loved every dish but there was always something good and we were well taken care of. Our houseperson was on top of it as well and made us feel welcome every day. I was especially pleased with the luggage service port of Seattle provided it made getting off the boat and into the city a breeze.

Jaime's Italian was the best meal we had on board by far. The appetizers especially - I'm still thinking about the bruschetta! Fish&amp;Ships was also super hot and fresh and yummy.

We booked one excursion through RC and that was the White Pass Train which we thought was well worth the money, we loved the views. Skagway in general was a pleasant surprise I had pretty low expectations but it was a clear beautiful day and we found plenty to do. I had a delicious latte at Bites on Broadway and tried the halibut at Skagway Brewing Co. Saw some whales from the North Star and the top deck here!

We loved Victoria too. Getting on and off was super easy and fast. We didn't book an excursion but chose to just walk around downtown, did some shopping and went to Beacon Hill Park. We chose to walk in and out which took about 25 minutes each way but there were lots of transit options.

**The unlucky** unfortunately one of the crew members got very ill and had to be helicoptered out. We were on our way to Juneau and had to loop around to go back towards Canada. The cruise director updated us that the surgery went well, thank goodness. But we did arrive to the port about 8 hours late. By the time we got off the ship almost all the shops were closed, the Mt. Robert's tram was closed, all excursions had to be cancelled. We didn't have any booked with RC so we didn't experience their refund process. It felt like a waste of time to get off the boat, walk around for about 30 minutes and then stand in the long, long line to get back onto the ship in time. Almost wished we had skipped it altogether. Not blaming the crew at ALL of course I would hope they would do this for any staff member or passenger! But of course we were disappointed to miss such a major port.

The glacier - didn't see it! We were supposed to see Dawes Glacier and cruise the inside passage. The passage was beautiful but from what I heard from other passengers we only got about 20% of the way in to see the glacier because of weather/ice. Again, this was something that couldn't have been helped but having missed Mendenhall in Juneau, this cruise was glacier-less and we were pretty sad. Not mad at the crew or anything but sad still.

**The bad** COMMUNICATION on this boat was nearly non-existent. We found ourselves asking fellow cruisers for updates. With Juneau, I wished they would have made it clearer on how late we would be arriving. We spent most of the day just kind of waiting and hoping we would be there soon. Once they told us it would be around 630pm we found ourselves waiting again it took a very long time for the gangway to open up. With the glacier, I was up at 715am and thought we were approaching it (I could see ice in the water) but before you knew it we were back to seeing regular mountains and all of us were left in the dark wondering what happened, did we miss it? Was it fog? Ice? Another cruise ship in the way? These were the questions/rumors all the passengers were talking about and as far as I'm aware we never got an official answer just hearsay. I wish we either had the option to turn on announcements in the room or the television map ran announcements at the bottom or something.

Embarkation wasn't ideal. We arrived right at our scheduled time and it took us 2.5 hours exactly to get on board. This was our first cruise so we weren't sure if this was normal but fellow cruisers seemed to say it was unusually bad. 

Also 1 kind of weird petty annoyance but at Guest Services I needed to sign one more form for the luggage service and they said they couldn't provide a pen because of ""germs"" and suggested I go back to my room to get one? So I had to walk across to a bar and grab one of their pens, sign it, and walk back. I guess the boxes full of pencils at trivia don't have as many germs as pens at guest services?

**OVERALL** we had a great time. We would absolutely cruise again. We would cruise with RC again too! If anything, our missed stops are a great excuse to visit Alaska again!

Cruise,"I am eyeing a 2023 Greek Isles cruise and am torn between the Enchanted Princess (Princess Cruise Line) and the Viva (Norwegian Cruise Line). Both are newer ships and have similar itineraries with NCL being 9 days--overnighting in Istanbul+1 additional port vs. PCL's 7 days. Norwegian is about $800 more for a family balcony, we would be in a mini-suite on Princess. 

They both look like lovely ships. I will be traveling with my husband (we're both 38) and our 13-year-old son. Princess is appealing to me because it's more low key and the medallion class ships seem really easy to navigate. NCL has way more activities on the ship (slides, go-karts, etc.)  that I know my son would enjoy but there are zero sea days, so I wonder how much we'd be on the ship to actually use them. It's brand new so there are also no reviews. The videos I've seen of the specs look really nice though, with a ton of outdoor space and dining options. 

I was leaning towards Princess but NCL has a pretty good Memorial Day promo and the Viva looks like a really nice ship. I'm looking for a cruise line we can continue to use in the future. I'd love to go to Alaska and other European ports in the coming years.

Cruise,"Long winded post below, save your time if you don't plan on booking with Princess.

For those considering Princess, I cannot begin to explain how horrible our 10 day Alaskan inside passage trip has been.  Our trip has been nothing but back to back annoyances and thought I'd share on Reddit for anyone considering this particular line.

First and foremost, the food is absolutely disgusting. For the first couple days my husband and I thought we were just being picky but slowly began hearing other passengers complain about the quality of food as well. Take a look at cruisecritic.com and you'll find plenty of people sharing the same opinion as ours.  I completely understand that food is a subjective topic, but I'm confident 90% of people reading this would find the food to be disgusting. The buffet is a constant rotation of the same handful of dishes, almost all of which have zero salt or pepper, much less any other seasoning.  The food in the main dining room is marginally better, but it's still barely edible. I know what you're thinking, I'm a food snob and expect 5 star meals or something. Nothing could be further from the truth. I enjoy things like Taco Bell and Campbell's soup for christ sake, so I definitely do not have a refined pallet and expect fine cuisine just to be satisfied.

The second issue we've dealt with is their Medallion app that they force you to use. I'm fairly savvy with apps and whatnot, so this isn't a situation of user error. Their app is virtually useless half of the time. The issue is that Princess forces you to use their app for Every. Single. Thing.  Want to read the Princess Patter for daily events? The TV in the stateroom directs you to the app that doesn't work. Want to have food/drinks delivered which is one of their big selling points? You need to depend on the app that doesn't know your true location on the ship is the majority of the time. Have issues where the app doesn't know where you're located for deliveries? You get to wait in line at guest services for 30 minutes (not an exaggeration) to have a new medallion issued because the one you got in the mail a week earlier now has a dead battery.

Another problem is that Princess is obviously sticking their head in the sand about covid outbreaks onboard. There are constantly employees in PPE coming to and from the quarantine section which is located on the same deck as our room. That was to be expected and we have no problems with that at all.  However, there are clearly sick passengers that are outside of quarantine areas. A lady next door to us has an *extremely* bad cough to the point like it sounds like she may vomit from coughing so much. Could it be something else? Sure, but I'd bet $ that is covid. I mentioned to our room steward in the hallway that I was curious if people were isolating in their original cabins (without saying I was referring to our neighbor) and he nodded to their door and didn't confirm or deny, but only said the ventilation to each room isn't shared and we'll be ok. I don't know how much I believe him about the ventilation, but so far I haven't caught anything (I've been self testing).  The issue is that I paid for a balcony and now have to wear a mask while on it because the winds have been non-existent and the sick lady next door to us spends all of her time on her balcony coughing even though it's clear staff know the people in that stateroom are sick. If someone is sick they should be moved to quarantine, that was the expectation we all agreed to when booking.

Lastly, don't buy their BS about the ""fastest internet as sea"". I understand that for Alaskan itineraries that satellite internet is extremely limited the further north you get. However while still docked in San Francisco the fastest internet we got was 2.6mbps. That was literally the fastest we ever got. Since leaving the bay we've been seeing speeds between 0 and 2mbps (if we're lucky). Guest services admitted there was an issue with the internet speeds and reimbursed us for the 4 device add-on package we purchased which is useless.

Let me be clear, the staff has been absolutely wonderful. I have not had a single bad experience with any employee and they all seem to recognize their app is a POS. However my husband and I have decided we will never take Princess again. I have spent literal hours of my vacation trying to deal with random app issues, topped off with trying my best to choke down the disgusting food they're serving. I strongly recommend people reconsider this line before booking.",First and last cruise with Princess,,thisplace82,,26,2022-05-28 01:40:55

I would also love to have a balcony room, or even a mini suite if I can get a good deal. I also don't think I want to be on a massive, massive boat, but I don't want to be on an old small one either. Interesting ports of call are also important to me. By that I mean ports that aren't just extensions of the cruise like Coco Bay. I am trying to decide between cruise lines I've narrowed it down to;

Norwegian: this seems like one of the better options for a solo cruiser, but it also seems like the least inclusive cruise for what you get when you are on board. 

Royal Caribbean: this also seems like a good option, and the oasis class boats also have dedicated studio balcony's which look cool, I would just be worried about getting a little lost in the crowd of a ship that size. RCL also seems like a much more family oriented cruise line, and while I don't mind kids, the less interaction with children I have, the better. 

Virgin Voyages: Their ships actually appeal to me the most, both in size, as well as food options, the food being completely included is a tempting option. However, their ports don't seem that interesting honestly. But the complete lack of children sounds amazing.

If anyone else is a solo cruiser who has some good advice I would appreciate it! Or if I am way off track let me know, the only cruise experience I have is a Disney cruise when I was 7, so I don't remember many of the little details.","Looking to take a solo Caribbean cruise next year in late February or anytime in March, can't decide what to book",,Zanoklido,,17,2022-05-27 17:42:39

Cruise,"My mother and I are on what would have been the cruise of a lifetime, a two week transatlantic cruise followed by a week-long mediterranean. Three weeks on the beautiful Disney Magic, a ship we‚Äôve sailed on many times. I know the consensus on this sub is that Disney is overpriced and filled with kids, and that‚Äôs true, but we like the movies and the theming and for these sailings we used some considerable discounts we had built up over 2020, so what would have been prohibitively expensive was now doable. 

The problem is, she's Covid positive. I know that a ton of people have gotten quarantined on a cruise ship, but I thought I should do a write up so anybody getting on one might know what to expect. Our experience is of course not representative of everybody's, but it's allowed us to see how Disney deals with Covid on their ships.

First, we found out a day before our transatlantic that to disembark on a European ports you have to have either gotten a booster within the last 270 days or get tested onboard the day before port. Since we (stupidly) hadn‚Äôt bothered getting the booster, my mother and I ended up getting tested three times on the transatlantic. The first was so that we could get off on the four ports we would be hitting. The second was done by our request. The third testing was so that we could disembark in Barcelona at the end of the cruise before reboarding for the Mediterranean. This test was done on the last day.

In brief, the first two tests came back negative. We requested the second because my mom had started showing symptoms and we wanted to know if we should quarantine or not. The nurse informed us that even though she was negative, they could only really be 50% sure that she didn't have Covid*. Despite this we were encouraged to go about our day as normal, attending dinner, shows, trivia, and whatever the hell else we wanted, even though my mom was coughing every couple minutes. Not wanting to infect anybody, we wore masks whenever we did go out, which wasn‚Äôt much. We should have worn them before this, but we had a false sense of security about the state of Covid onboard.

Our ignorance wasn‚Äôt entirely our fault. We‚Äôd asked Guest Services twice about Covid onboard after hearing rumors of an outbreak and were lied to both times. The head of Guest Services even went so far as to tell us that he didn‚Äôt know if there was Covid. Another said that even if there was, they had it under control and we had nothing to worry about. It was like some weird version of the narcissists prayer. ‚ÄúThere is no Covid onboard, and even if there is we don‚Äôt know about it, and even if we do we have it under control.‚Äù What makes this so blatently false is that Disney Cruise Line doesn‚Äôt have a special team for dealing with Covid onboard. If a quarantined passenger wants something or has a question, you know who they call? Guest Services. Days later when we went to the ship doctor for the second Covid test, we asked whether there was Covid on the ship. He practically laughed, and I don‚Äôt blame him, because looking back on it Guest Service‚Äôs appeal to ignorance was ridiculous. Had they informed us of the threat, we would have known to take more precautions. We‚Äôre pretty careful people. This is our first time getting any sort of sickness since before Covid started. The ship is the only place we (again, stupidly) forego the masks, because of the aforementioned illusion of security.

By the third test I was already experiencing symptoms. Despite this I tested negative, while my mom got her first positive test and was told she had to quarantine for the rest of that day and the five days after that. When I asked what I should do, the person who tested us acted like I was an idiot for worrying I might infect anybody. Even though I was in the same room as my mom and had symptoms, I was once again encouraged to go out and behave as normal. I couldn‚Äôt have been the first person to have been told this, and even though I‚Äôve barely left the room the whole time, wearing a mask every time, I know not everybody was so careful. Which means there are who-knows-how many infected people walking around the ship at any given time.

We were allowed to quarantine (although technically only my mom was quarantined) on board, since we were doing a back to back. Otherwise we would have been quarantined in Barcelona. Where in Barcelona? They didn‚Äôt know. The day of disembarkment they still didn‚Äôt know where they were going to put the multiple other infected people on the ship. We were lucky to have had a room on the ship. At least that part of the process wasn‚Äôt confused.

I can‚Äôt complain much about their reinbursement policy. We were refunded for every day of quarantine, which seems like a no-brainer but with a company like Disney you never know. What I can complain about is the sheer incompetence we encountered. Nobody knew anything. Two years into the pandemic, one year after opening back up, and they still haven‚Äôt figured out how to deal with this situation. Whatever one person says, you‚Äôd best believe the next person‚Äôs gonna contradict it. The ‚ÄúPublic Health Officer‚Äù is worse than useless. Everything he told us about the quarantine we found out later was completely wrong. As his final stroke of genius he gave us an expired Covid test to administer in our stateroom. 

But the coup-de-gras of onboard incompetence came when my mother received a call from the woman who tested her. She informed us that not only should we have gotten a daily call from the doctor‚Äôs office, but also that I should have been retested due to my having symptoms. This is the same person who days before told me to go ahead and get out and not worry about the possibility of infecting somebody. But instead of an admission of incompetence, this was all reframed as somehow the fault of us, even though the only information we‚Äôd ever gotten came from us hounding people with questions that they didn‚Äôt seem to want to bother answering. It was impossible that they really hadn‚Äôt called to check up on my mom‚Äîwe had to be lying. Not only that, but apparently we should have informed them that I was still symptomatic, something I could have done if they‚Äôd called in the first place. And my being in the room with her the whole time but not being quarantined? That was a mistake too according to her. I should have been removed to a different room. When we asked the Public Health Officer about this, he said that was ridiculous. Of course I shouldn‚Äôt have been removed. Which one of them is right? I have no idea, and I doubt they do either. Two years into Covid and they still haven‚Äôt seemed to settle on a script or learned how to deal with the people who got infected from their ship.

This might be a little too long of a rant, but I thought that anybody planning to go on a Disney ship in the future should be aware of the clusterfuck in store for them if they happen to get sick on board.


Tl;dr: People in the same room as a Covid-positive passenger don‚Äôt have to quarantine, even if they themselves have symptoms, so long as they‚Äôre negative. When asking about Covid onboard, expect that you‚Äôre being lied to. And even if you do test negative, the test‚Äôs they use are only 50% accurate.

*Edit: Originally I said there was a 50/50 chance she had Covid. This was wrong. The tests are 50% accurate, meaning that if given a negative result you know the likelihood of having Covid is anywhere from 0-50%.",Covid-positive on the Disney Magic.,,Tertiary1234,,40,2022-05-24 18:32:31

The ship had propulsion issues so they had to cancel Grand Cayman because they couldn‚Äôt risk breaking down somewhere they couldn‚Äôt dock. To make it up to us they promised extra hours at Montego Bay and Cozumel. That wasn‚Äôt really true. We were only in Montego for 6 hours!


We did a carnival excursion in Montego that was just awful. We drove about an hour to the beach after sitting around on the bus. They told us we had 3 hours to spend there but after 2 hours they came back and started hustling people onto the bus. They took us shopping at Rose Hall in the pouring rain for 15 mins where only 2 crappy souvenir shops were open and packed with multiple bus loads of people. 

We got to be in Cozumel for 10 hours which was really the only nice part of the trip. 

I had always heard that there‚Äôs so many activities to do on board but most things on the schedule were attempts to get you to buy cheap crap at a markup like the jewelry and art or do snake oil health seminars. Pools and hot tubs were so crowded. Unless you wanted to play trivia all day or sit out in the hot sun you were limited. 

Food was meh. We ate at all the options and quality was so hit and miss. 

Not to mention AC seemed to be failing and random parts of the ship would be hot and muggy. The last morning the AC on deck 5 was mostly out and it was so humid they had to put up wet floor signs everywhere. And that‚Äôs to say nothing of how late we got off the ship and the chaos at the docks as 4000 people tried to leave as more people were boarding. 

I don‚Äôt get it. Just we just have a particularly bad experience or is this just how cruising is? Is it even worth trying a better cruise line?",Ship Engine Problems on Carnival,,hkral11,,41,2022-05-22 21:19:45

Cruise,"I'm going on my first cruise( and first vacation) with my best friend in Sept and I'm so excited! I have a few questions. We're Canadian and we're flying to Rome on the 6th to stay for a couple of days before the cruise. We are staying in Athens for 2 days after the cruise. 

For Turkey (2 stops) the e-visa site says that cruise passengers don't need a visa if the stay is less than 72 hours. Does anyone have experience with this? Should we get visas anyway? We have shore excursions booked for every port.

The current testing requirements are 72 hours before the cruise ( I know this can change and we'll be watching closely) We'll be arriving in Rome about 6 hours too early to get a test at the airport. How easy or difficult is it to get rapid tested in Rome? Princess says they have a limited amount of tests at port for $60, how limited? Should I call them and book ahead? 

I've read about ship time and actual time. Should I get a digital watch to reflect ship time? How do you all manage this?

I plan on getting a private car to transport us to the port because of how far it is from Rome and it makes me anxious to rely on public transportation in a foreign country. The port is much closer to the city in Athens. Does it make more sense to take public transport there?

Our ship leave port at 7pm day one from Rome. What to the boarding times look like in that instance? Do we have to be super early or are there later boarding times? 

If I want to go to a specialty restaurant but my cabin mate doesn't, can I go myself?

Since everything is done by the app, is it necessary to get onboard wifi?

Any other tips and tricks? I'm so excited but I've never thought of myself ever cruising before. I've been doing tons of research but there's still so much to learn!

I would like to take the rapid antigen and want to take it three days prior due to my schedule but I don‚Äôt want to get screwed last min.

Cruise,"I have been on one cruise on the NCL joy and am looking into booking another cruise as a bit of a birthday gift to myself (Sadly I can't take off work to go on my birthday so it either got to be before or after it, likely some time after)

The first cruise was on the NCL Joy which I enjoyed (Balcony though I did not use it enough in my opinion). I looked into another NCL sailing, but sadly that is looking for something over $1600 for an inside cabin which I just can't justify along with being in Miami means it is more of a hike than going to the Fort Lauderdale cruise port and Orlando has shitty transportation options to get to the port.

I have seen two ok deals for early September for the FTL port which is closer and easier to manage to get to. Royal carabian has a 6-night sailing on the Allure, but Celebery infinity a smaller ship has a 7-night sailing for a little less and I believe has the basic drink package included unless I misread something and that not being true for an inside cabin.

Would being on RCCL bigger ship and one less day justify the extra money (a small amount for the difference and possibly a bit more if I get the drink package) Or is the infinity the better option for less money, the extra day and drinks included? Or am I missing something in my planning and might find something more interesting for the price?

As for what I liked about my first cruise (Which would be important to decide what to do next) I thought the Joy had good food, I liked the shows live music, the comedians, and other live shows I had the chance to see.

My wife and I are taking our second cruise ever this summer to Alaska. First time in Alaska. We are booked for August 13 out of Seattle with the Crown Princess. However, this ship is experiencing engine trouble and only one diesel generator is working, so the ship can‚Äôt sail at full speed. A couple port times are taking a hit, and in fact we will only have a couple hours in Victoria. Full days in a couple other (I guess the most popular) ports.

My wife and I recently returned from a 16-Day Transatlantic Cruise from New York to Rome on the Norwegian Escape.  This was our honeymoon.  We had the good fortunate of our upgrade-bid for a Haven Penthouse Suite being accepted.  The Haven was absurdly luxurious - highly recommend!!  The luxury experience spoiled and ruined us for all future cruises.  There is no going back!   The food, the service, the exclusivity, the suite itself - my goodness, it was all amazing.

Previously, we had only cruised with Royal Caribbean.  On this cruise, we had intended to compare Norwegian to Royal Caribbean and ultimately, choose one cruise line or the other going forward.  However, comparing anything to the Haven is simply not fair.  The only downside is that our curiosity persists.

Cruise,"So I‚Äôm not really sure if this is the place to do this, but I need to get this off my chest, and if hopelessly shouting into the void of Reddit helps me do that, so be it.

I (22M) and my partner (22F) booked an Alaska cruise on the Celebrity Eclipse back in February, set to sail on May 22nd. We did so during a rather difficult time for both of us, as neither of us planned any sort of spring break trip for our senior year of college, and with my dad being admitted to the hospital for an extended stay. Needless to say, we both needed a pick me up, and what better way to do that than by booking a cruise? I am personally on a quest to visit all 50 states, and being from the East Coast, neither of us had been to Alaska. Additionally, this was set to be my first cruise ever, and I was ecstatic for the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. We paid everything in full up front and started making plans for our upcoming trip. 

Fast forward to about 2 weeks ago. I get an email from Celebrity, thinking it contained more detail about our trip. Nope. They abruptly cancelled our trip due to a barnacle growth on the ship, a mere two and a half weeks before we were supposed to set sail. As for the compensation offered, they said we could either rebook before May 17th (yesterday) for a future cruise sailing to Alaska with a 25% discount, or wait until the 17th for a full refund. This was the single biggest purchase of my life, and being a recent college grad, I didn‚Äôt have a ton of free money just floating around to be held in limbo, so I was hoping if we couldn‚Äôt rebook, I‚Äôd be able to get my money back fairly quickly.

Looking at the prices for future 2022 Alaska cruises by Celebrity, the price differences from our original booking were substantial enough to essentially make the 25% discount we‚Äôd been offered worthless. As such, we found a Princess cruises on the same dates with similar ports and activities offered, and booked that one instead, for around the same price (my girlfriend paid in full this time, as I was still waiting for my money). 

Anyways, we wait around till yesterday for the rebook deadline to expire, expecting to get our money back around now so we can enjoy our new vacation stress-free. I hadn‚Äôt seen anything posted to my bank account as of this morning, so against my better judgement , I decided to call Celebrity and figure out the situation. After being on hold for a full hour, I had a 2 minute conversation with a representative, who then informed me that it could take up to THIRTY BUSINESS DAYS TO RECEIVE MY MONEY BACK. As if 30 regular old days wasn‚Äôt bad enough, it could take a month and a half to get my money back. Again, this is the single biggest expense I‚Äôve ever paid in my life, and they‚Äôve got my money in limbo now for an extended period of time. Never mind the fact that they had 2 weeks to sort this out before the rebook deadline as well. I hope to God they just gave me that time frame to cover their asses instead of it actually taking that long. Time will tell.

Needless to say, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be sailing on a Celebrity cruise , after that experience. I‚Äôm still very much looking forward to my first cruise and going to Alaska, but Celebrity has added an unnecessary amount of stress to what should‚Äôve been a fun vacation. I didn‚Äôt mean for this post to a full-on Karen level rant, but it seems it may have. I just needed to get all this anger and frustration off of my chest.

1) What is cruising like in general with a toddler? Are there daycares that can watch them for extended time or only an hour or two? Are daycares open on port days or sea days only?

2) Any cruise line seem to do better for people traveling with toddlers? Maybe longer daycare hours or more availability?

3) Are shore excursions still enjoyable? We love active shore excursions like hiking or jet skiing or snorkeling, etc. Can‚Äôt see doing any of those with a toddler. Any fun activities other then bus tours and beach days for people that like to be active?

Cruise,"So, a couple months ago, my wife and I booked an October cruise for ourselves, our daughter and one of her friends. The friend will be 17 at the time of sailing. It's a 7-day on Carnival, going out of New Orleans.

The friend is not vaccinated. Her parents are pretty... against it. At least her mom is, who seems to make the decisions. At the time we were booking, we told the mom, ""Right now, they are requiring pretty much everyone to be vaccinated. I guess there's a chance that might change before October, but right now - those are the rules."" And she went ahead and gave her daughter permission and paid us for (most) of her daughter's fare.¬†My wife ran into the mom over the weekend and she said something like, ""I really hope they change that vaccine rule before the cruise."" 

As of right now, the friend is just listed as TBA on our booking. So, there's no name on it. We did that on purpose, just in case something happens (like the rule doesn't change and she doesn't get vaccinated) and we can't take her. That way we could at least maybe bring someone else on the cruise.

Fast forward to today. With cases going up, I really doubt the vaccine mandate will be dropped by October. If the girl is going to get her vaccine, she would need to get the first dose in August, I'm figuring. (The kid really wants to go and would get vaccinated to do so in a second, if her mom would allow it.) At what point would you tell the girl's mom, ""Look, I really don't think they're going to lift the vaccine mandate. She's going to either have to get the vaccine, or she won't be able to go."" Is sooner better? Would you say something like, ""If the rules don't change by the first of August, you're going to have to make a decision?""

Cruise,"I have a few rooms reserved (me + 9 friends) for my 30th on the Scarlet Lady this October, and while I felt really good about this as a celebration, I've recently run into some doubts based on videos aboard the ship which makes it appear like passengers skew significantly older. Reviews I've seen that were closer to my age almost all mentioned that they don't drink and I couldn't really gauge much in terms of aligned interests.

I have no issue partying with any age group, but was curious if our group would have a better time going somewhere that might cater to a younger audience (e.g. Tulum, Ibiza, a different cruise line) based on your experiences voyaging with Virgin. To be clear, I'm not looking for a rager or college-level wild parties, but our group will definitely be drinking and would ideally like to socialize/flirt with similar groups and singles. We're all from Miami/NY and are accustomed to a more outgoing lifestyle. 

Some details about our group/the trip:

\- Our age group is all late 20's to early 30's, fit/active young professionals.

\- I'm the only one that's really been on a cruise before (many RC and Carnival).

\- Many of us (me included) are queer (which was a huge incentive since I keep reading how LGBTQ+ friendly the ship/staff is).

So any Virgin non-virgins, what do you think? If we go will our group be the ""loud young ones"" at dinner/the pool? With lower capacities, how restaurants appear to be split and a lack of central area/atrium, did you find it hard socializing with other groups or finding party buddies onboard? Will we be one of very few at the entertainment venues into the wee hours of the morning? Outside of the queer scene, are there plenty of viable candidates for my straight friends to flirt with if they want to ""get some""?

Cruise,"I went on this trip with my (26m) girlfriend (25f) and my parents (early 60's) and we had a blast! We tried pretty much everything the ship had to offer, and wanted to offer my thoughts.

I'll start with the Cons first because that's more interesting to read:

Cons:
1. The Royal Esplanade. A hallmark of Royal Carribean ships built over the last 20 years is the Royal Promenade, a multi-story hall in the ship that's lined with stores and restaurants. Quantum and Quantum + class ships feature a twist on that concept with the Royal Esplanade. It's far narrower and ditches the huge open air concept. We all agreed that it was a downgrade. The paths can get extremely congested, and you have to walk through restaurants and bars to get around on the upper deck. It lost a lot of the charm and people watching opportunity of the Promenade. 

2. Social 180. This is the ship's teen area. It wasn't long ago that I was a teenager on cruise ships, so im not griping about the presence of teens on the ship. My complaint is that the ship takes up a TON of premium real estate on the ship with the teen areas. There was a gorgeous sun deck, the highest on the ship, that was the teen ""Patio"". The problem in dedicating that much premium space to teens is that it misunderstands teenagers. If you tell a teen ""go there and stay there"", that's the last thing they'll do. The spaces were just so underused. 

3. Specialty dining. Our experience with specialty dining was underwhelming, and we went to everything but the hibachi restaurant. The food didn't justify the $50 upcharge per person over main dining. I've dreamed of going back to Chop's for ten years and it was largely ""meh"". One note is the sides say they're served ""family style"" but the serving sizes are smaller than an individual side; prepare to order 3-4 a person. Don't order anything at Giovannis that isn't one of their ""favorites""; the favorites were great but everything else on the menu was Olive Garden quality at best. Note: we did really enjoy Wonderland and Izumi Sushi. 


Pros:
1. Two70. This is the large multi-use venue on the aft of the ship. It seems to be a spiritual successor to the Viking Crown on older ships. There's often a fun activity going on, but when there's not it's a delightful quiet reading space. We enjoyed the signature show and Cafe Two70 is great. 
2. The solarium is fantastic. Everything about the design was wonderful, and even got a hottub to ourselves for sail away. The pool and hot tub were normally empty, but get there early for a chair. 
3. SeaPlex. This is a vast improvement over the netted sports courts on most ships. The bumper cars were a ton of fun, and there's normally some sport on the cruise calendar. We really loved Playmakers; it had the best beer selection on the ship and was normally very quiet thanks to being a bit tucked away. 
4. Top Deck seating- a small note, we loved the daybeds arranged on the top deck. The limited shade made it much easier to stay out in the sun for longer. Get out there early to grab a daybed; most are claimed by 9am. Also a wonderful place to grab some quiet at-night. They're cleaned regularly, btw.

About two weeks before the cruise I made a reservation with National Rental Car for around ($100 US). Holland America was selling the shore excursion for $139 per person. 
When we arrived in Vancouver,we were one of the first people off the ship and we walked from the cruise terminal to the inner harbor, which was about a mile and a half (40ish minutes.).

It was about a 40 minute drive to Butchart Garden each way and there is a large parking lot on site.

Cruise,"**Background**: My wife and I have been on 2 (me) and 3 (her) previous cruises. This was going to be our 2nd and 3rd cruise with Carnival with our only other cruise being on Norwegian. We haven't cruised Carnival since 2013 so a lot of changes have come about.

**Cruise**: 7 Day on the Mardi Gras 7-14 May (Nassau, Amber Cove, Grand Turk). We booked a standard balcony room in mid-forward on the 14th floor.

**Embarkation**: We followed the VeriFly instructions prior to arrival. Both of us are vaccinated less of the boosters. This only changed the fact that we couldn't get a COVID test until 48 hours prior to embarkation instead of 72 hours. We arrived at an off-site parking provider and instead of waiting for their shuttle line to diminish, we caught and Uber from the parking lot and that took all of 5 minutes to get us to the terminal. We made it to the terminal 10 minutes prior to our arrival window but we were sent up to the main area. We arrived and waited a very short time before a member started to help us get checked in using VeriFly and their system. This process took all of a couple of minutes and we then proceeded through security. Once through security we walked right onto the boat. Once on the boat, we wandered and were allowed to our room just after 1pm, to which we received our room keys. We then proceeded to our assigned muster station where they do check you in, give a brief on emergency operations and set you free. This saved large groups as they did it frequently for each muster station and allowed people to complete it on their time before 3:30pm.

**The trip**: The boat still looked and felt new throughout. The room was clean, but felt narrow despite have plenty of room length wise. We tried just about every included food option and did the Tepanyaki for lunch one day as well. We also had the Cheer's Package.

* We attended the Brewery Tour ($27) on our second day which was a fun experience if you like beer and the science behind it. There isn't a lot to see in terms of the brewery, but you get to try all the beers they have on tap. The trying consisted of trying as much as you wanted.  At the end, you got a pint glass, certificate and your bill for the tour.
* For seated dining options, the ability to request a table and see wait times prior was a nice change. Once your party was assigned a table, you were able to proceed to a host to which they would seat you. This was a new concept for a lot and confusion existed amongst a lot of people, but slowly everyone figured it out.
* Port days we ventured off the boat early and then came back to enjoy a empty boat that had plenty of room in just about any area. Food options are little more limited on port days, but didn't affect us.
* The shows that took place on Center Stage were awesome. The tough part is getting a seat. Shows started at 7:30pm but people would start getting their seats around 5pm. Seats later can be found, but might have an obstruction in the way.
* The comedy shows were relocated from the Punchliner Comedy Club to the Limelight Lounge to accommodate a BlackJack tournament. The adult shows took place in the Mardi Gras Theatre. The PG rated shows were just as funny, if not funnier than the rated R shows.
* All the bars on the boat have different drink menus, but just about anything at each bar could be ordered. This was fun as each bar had a different theme and the drinks followed that theme. Majority of the mixed alcoholic drinks were $10-$13, beers were $7-10. The cheers package covers all drinks $20 and under with a limit of 15 alcoholic drinks from 6am-6am.
* Bathrooms throughout the boat are odd. They have automatic door openers with hand wave, but a handful of the bathrooms the door opens up and the urinals are right behind the door for all to watch. Also, one of the bathrooms is in a busy area but was the smallest one it seemed on the boat. They were just about always clean, but not the most accommodating.

**Disembarkation**: Diamond and Platinum members got early disembarkation. All others were asked to leave when their muster station was called. We were in port and the first groups were starting to exit the boat by 7am. Our station was the 3rd one called and we were back to our car by 7:30am.

**Summary**: We were extremely pleased with the quality of the service and things offered. Getting on and off the ship was extremely easy. The worst part of the trip was the waiting for elevators. The elevators felt small and buildups or taking a second or third elevator was not uncommon. The Carnival Hub app was very helpful planning for events and finding what food/drink options were open or when they would be open. Even had the ability to place room service orders from the app, although I never gave this a shot.

There‚Äôs  so much that goes into choosing the perfect godmother for each of our  ships. That‚Äôs why, when choosing the woman to represent our newest  ship‚Äîwhich will set the gold standard of cruising‚Äîwe chose the gold medal winning gymnast, Simone Biles.

Simone is truly the G.O.A.T (Greatest Of All Time) inside  and outside of the gym, and I‚Äôm humbled and thrilled to welcome her as  godmother of Celebrity Beyond. While  I‚Äôve marveled at her abilities and historic accomplishments as a  gymnast, it‚Äôs Simone‚Äôs courage to speak out and her ability to help  others be better in sport and in life that has impressed me the most.  She has risen to the occasion and overcome challenges time and time  again. She is an inspiration.

Simone will join us in Fort Lauderdale on November 4,  2022, for the official ceremony to name Celebrity Beyond. We look  forward to that momentous occasion.

Food I am not very adventurous 

Night one I got the Caesar salad (dressing was a cheap bland dressing) it was ok when I added anchovies to it. 

That being said my waitress was afraid of her kitchen people. I asked for extra and since I didn‚Äôt get another salad I was told no. Not being pushy I said weird but ok. 

French onion soup. Good good. 


Get the 10$ New York bc I am not a fan of their jerk meat which was just regular meat with pepper, tried their chicken and waffles which was a Tiny wing flat and drum connected with some what they called southern fried but it wasn‚Äôt and the syrup was spicy. Steak was a waffle house quality and came out over cooked. 


Night two I am told no on anchovies I ask for manager get them. 

Calamari is good but it‚Äôs not a main course if you ask me 



Night 3 I did butchers cut for oyster Rockefeller and if you do there do ala cart the New York is good and only 45$ compared to the ribeye in the package with two sides. It‚Äôs not a deal it‚Äôs just pressured sales. 


Night 4 did pizza was told no pepperoni just bc took minutes of asking for manager and which he said ‚Äúfor why‚Äù manager eventually made them Make pepperoni

The cruise line states on their website that pre-planned early disembarkation/late embarkation is not allowed, but I think it's somewhat clear from that language that an *un*planned early disembarkation (e.g. a family emergency back home) would be acceptable. In this case I don't have to worry about PVSA because I'd be flying from a foreign country back to the U.S. 

My main questions are: does this, in general, sound like it would work; would a family emergency excuse be enough (and would they require proof); should I notify employees before or after leaving the ship in the country I intend to fly out of; will I be able to fly out of the country without having my passport stamped.

Cruise,"There was a discussion in one of the big Virgin Voyages Facebook groups about how few tickets they're selling. (Discussion got deleted by admins.) I've been on Virgin twice now, and the one last week was at only 25% capacity, and MANY of those were travel agents on comped cruises. I suspect no more than 10-15% or so were ""real"" paying passengers.

I should say here that I LOVED Virgin Voyages. I brought various friends both times who are also frequent cruisers, and they all loved it as well. Everyone I spoke with on board raved about how Virgin was leagues better than any other line they had cruised. If they had a little more diversity of destinations, which they will in the future, I would not cruise another line again.

That said, clearly they are not reaching enough people or their prices are not sufficiently competitive. They told me beforehand they would be at 65% capacity, so the fact that so few people were on board shows that they're struggling.

Then someone posted in the now deleted thread that Virgin had offered the brand for sale to RCL and NCL, and that both declined to buy it. He said they are trying to offer it to Carnival now.

Cruise,"Recently finished a trip on the Norwegian Escape between April 25th - May 13th. In short, after day 7, many shows became repetitive and lack much of the original content so they do warrant revisits.
Food and enmities were great. The fine dining and many sit down restaurants have very good options. For a quick bite it‚Äôs generally go to the cafe but mostly for snack. The spa was also very enjoyable. Do wait until the flyers/specials are available midway your cruise to take advantage of the perks offered.

For those concerned about Covid, this is likely the break it deal (at least for me). As much cleaning that is done on the ship, I still managed to get Covid (which may of been a result of a show I watched or an excursion), towards the tail end of the trip. This has resulted in me staying abroad as I cannot re-enter the states without first showing a negative test one day prior to flying. NCL has been unable to find a hotel to keep me isolated while I wait for a flight long enough to allow for recovery. The worst part is that it‚Äôs gone mostly silent from NCLS part as to what I can expect next. All cruise long I‚Äôve been  met with great hospitality and buthler like service. Now I‚Äôm having to call the desk every hour to see when my wife and I can leave and call the other hotel we had a booking on to cancel (along with other excursions). * my wife and I are both vaccinated and boosted

TLDR: if you cruise, keep a mask on to advert being stuck abroad in

Update Day 1 Quarantine on ship: NCL could not secure rooms for what appeared to have been a few 100 guests so we disembarked for an additional day at sea. We lost our original cabin (had a Balcony with queen conjoined) and was moved to a much smaller state room with two twins and a non functioning bathroom. The level of service im receiving down here makes me feel as though it‚Äôs my fault and I‚Äôm the bottom dwelling bastard child no one wants to see/talk to. The only comp we‚Äôve received is the limited free internet that is tremendously slow(unable to login to Hulu for instance). Contacting the desk has been fruitless with no one picking up (potentially attending to the new passengers on board). Hoping things are much improved tomorrow and will update with day 2 deets

Update Day 2 Quarantine

the time of writing it‚Äôs now 11am. Our toilet went down again last night and was finally resolved around 10am. There was a code bravo on deck 2 which sounded like a fire started and resolved around 9am. This however resulted in our 8am breakfast to be delivered around 10:30am. I contacted guest services again and I was still unable to login to the Wi-Fi as of last night (even though we were told we‚Äôd get unlimited access along with movies), yet the account appears locked and unable to activate both features. We were told we‚Äôd get new masks (as many of us either had masks we‚Äôve been wearing since Tues or didn‚Äôt have any) and never received any. I‚Äôm not sure other guests got it either. My impressions are that this ship(or it‚Äôs leadership) fail to have any contingency plan in place in the event for an event this big. I feel terrible for the staff as, when asked, they don‚Äôt seem to have the answers either nor the support from their management staff. I irony being that the ship is not as max capacity. When I originally boarded, we‚Äôre at roughly 1500 out of 4500 occupancy.

Mid evening Day 2 update. Not much has changed from yesterday. We still haven‚Äôt received any communication as to what to expect when the boat makes to shore. I did try calling NCL Corp to get at least someone to tell me what the standard protocol would be but no new information. My internet was cut off again and when I was told if I could access a second device (for both my wife and I), we were told only one device could be active at a time (it‚Äôs not costing them anything to add a device either..). NCL is quickly showing that unless you‚Äôre a paying customer , they don‚Äôt give two cares about what happens to you so long as it‚Äôs not caught in the public eye. I‚Äôm not a person that generally gets upset but this makes it so I‚Äôd pursue more legal action as well as adversities to ppl to avoid this cruise line or be extremely careful.

Day 3 of Quarantine on NCL Escape:
I finally got a hold of someone that was able to resolve the Wi-Fi as well as give me access to the (limited) movie selection to provide me some sanity from having to share 1 login with my wife allowing me to follow up on work related items as well as keep family in the loop for house keeping items at home. I was able to get emails to NCL Corp Guest Services and wrote an email explaining my experience noted above.We‚Äôve created a Facebook to also have some communication with those that were quarantined at local hotels via the onboard cabins. Testing is said to commence on Day 5 and 6 with both tests having to be negative to be allowed of or we‚Äôll be subjected to stay onboard until the conclusion of the second leg of the voyage (with final stop in Rome).

Day 4
Last night I called the guest services manager and had explained much of what was going on as mention in the prior posts above. Today we received letters (finally) indicating next steps and what is to be expected. It explained we were kept on the ship in their care and are being held 7 days on board in accordance to Italian Covid protocol . Options to our guest room including movies and wifi now appear to more easily accsisible and guest services called to ask if there was anything else that was needed along with room service to confirm our food had arrived and if it was complete. Sadly, this is the kind of level of service I was expecting on Day 1 of quarantine and should of been only after it was brought up. It appears that whomever was handling the inquiries perhaps didn‚Äôt speak up or realize there was a high volume of calls coming from the quarantine deck. NCL took a more reactive then a proactive approach and fuels my initial impression that they really don‚Äôt have a plan for a Covid outbreak. On a fun note, we‚Äôve began calling random rooms and sharing our experience and getting to know our fellow quarantine friends. We‚Äôve created a Facebook group to help keep those who perhaps we haven‚Äôt spoken to informed of any question we have asked (in case they have it as well) or to assist those that perhaps were separated and require more help that NCL is not providing (like booking flights or figuring transport). It appears the plan is to keep us until we reach Naples (Day 7), which is three days less from the ships final destination. Most guests agree that we aren‚Äôt mad moreso upset at the handling of the over situation and why more comprehensive testing wasn‚Äôt conducted more frequently given the longer journey

Day 5 Quarantine
According to Italy Regulation, one needs to isolate 7 days after exposure. It sounds like NCL is adhering to this and keeping everyone onboard until we reach Italy once again. Some ppl have started to get moved up but only those that had paid for the second half of the voyage. My wife and I had our temperature checked but no testing conducted to see how we stand. We‚Äôll be tested on the 18th (in Messina Italy), but likely won‚Äôt be let off until the end of the voyage (19th). The only saving grace is the fact housing and food is being taken care of.

I'm planning my honeymoon and considering going on a cruise for the first time in my life. We generally travel on a budget but this actually seems like a phenomenal deal considering all the countries and included excursions. 

It also includes a three day trip to machu piccu? Is that serious?

Is the food really as incredible as everyone says it is? 

Are the rooms quiet enough and wifi strong enough to do work out of?

We are in our mid-30's and want to make friends... is everyone over 60? Do they want to be friends with us? 

Does it feel like you have enough time at each port to really hang out and get a feel of the city? 

What is the on-board entertainment like?

Cruise,"Background: Gf and I are in our mid twenties (we are basically old farts though) and going on our first cruise. We chose Alaska as our destination, having experienced the PNW before and wanting a more nature involved/laid back experience. I have several house keeping questions

1) How long does embarkation take? You show up to the port, and Im guessing they take a look at your bags and documents and some waiting is involved. Is it a few minutes? A few hours? 

And once you embark what do you do? Usually go straight to your room?

2) How is the disembarkation process for cruise ships at various ports? Does it take quite a while? Do they call people out by room number? Do they board by room number as well?

3) Excursions, we have a list of various excursions. Particularly in Juneau we want to do a tram and a hike. Is there a way to see if we have time for both or when each starts? We will be in Juneau from 2:30 PM to 10:00 PM according to our schedule.

4) Water: We are water snobs. Any hard water/heavy mineral water will cause issues for us (water like Fiji, evian, etc; but we are fine with normal water like Aquafina, crystal geyser, dasani, etc). How is the water on a cruise ship? Do you refill at a station somewhere and if so should I bring a big jug or container to keep more water than just a single bottle in the room?

5) Cruise Laundry, we were planning on 4 pairs of clothes on a cruise ship, for 7 days and doing laundry. Are laundry machines usually long wait lines or pretty easy to come by?

6) Alaska specific: We are going late June, should we bring a Parka or are just several layers and a rain coat usually enough? We will be bringing gloves and a hat as well. 

Are waterproof hiking shoes good enough or should we bring heavy duty hiking boots? What about a hiking pole/stick?

Cruise,"We're sailing on the Jewel of the Seas in August and chose to get a guaranteed oceanview cabin. A few days ago, we got the room number and found out it's on deck 2. That part doesn't bother us. What does is that cabin only has a tiny porthole to look through. 

We've had a guaranteed oceanview cabin before, and the window was one of the regular ones, so this assignment was a little disappointing. Especially since we enjoy spending time in our room looking out. 

As of now, it costs around ‚Ç¨500 to select another cabin, which isn't ideal but doable. However, we were hoping to get an upgrade since the current cabin is on the same deck as the med bay. Plus, we just sailed on the Voyager a couple of weeks ago and were upgraded to a balcony from a guaranteed oceanview. At the time, we thought the upgrade was given to make space for the Covid quarantine area. 

So my question for you all is: 

* Would you go ahead and pay ‚Ç¨500 to pick a different oceanview cabin? 
* Wait to see if the cabin is upgraded?
* Try our hand at bidding on RoyalUp to *maybe* get it a little cheaper than ‚Ç¨500?

Side note, my husband reached out to the travel site we booked on, and they didn't offer many options.

Cruise,"Hi, friends. This happened two years ago and I am still confused by it. Maybe one of you can shed some light on this incident. My husband and I went on a Bermuda cruise with Norwegian. We were dining one evening in O'Sheehans. We both were working on a beer or a cocktail and had planned to put in an order for something to snack on. Our waiter came by and I didn't know what I wanted yet so we sent him away. He came back a few minutes later to see what we wanted and I still hadn't even looked at the menu (I know I should have looked and been ready to order but my husband and I were just having a nice conversation and I didn't stop to think about it). I sent him away again, apologizing that I wasn't ready. A few minutes later another lady came around asking if we were ready to order, and I was ready at that point, so we ordered. The original waiter came back a few minutes after that and asked for our order. We told him that someone came by previously and we gave her our order. He became very upset with us and said something like, ""I'm your waiter you have to put your order in with me, not anybody else."" It was super uncomfortable because he was actually very upset by us doing that. I felt really bad, we gave him a $20 bill after the meal because we felt so bad, but we were super perplexed by it.

Cruise,"I have filed a refund request with NCL, been back and forth with guest relations, and filed a complaint with Better Business Bureau. NCL refuses to address my concern and they have not responded to the BBB complaint I filed a month ago now. Im looking for any advice on other action I can take or what to do. 

Im going to include my BBB complaint, but TLDR is I asked a customer service agent about my options for changing my cruise. They advised me they could give me a full cruise credit for the amount I paid. Instead they canceled my cruise and applied a cancellation fee of over two thousand. I was refunded less than half of what I paid. Again, I had asked for and been fine with a FCC. Please let me know what I can do or any advice. I‚Äôm including the BBB complaint.

BBB Complaint: 
I purchased a transatlantic cruise with Norwegian on 3/11/2022 with a sailing date of 4/24/2022. Unfortunately, COVID cases increased after booking, and the conflicts in Europe got worse. I did not feel safe traveling that far for that long. I spoke with Norwegian about my options. After submitting to guest relations I was advised refund requests could take up to 30 days, so I sent a message to customer service on 3/14. This was all before my cruise was officially canceled. At this point, I still had the cruise. After my guest relations submission, I spoke with an agent on 3/14 and requested to cancel my cruise. They told me they would cancel my reservation for a future cruise credit of the full amount I paid. I verified just to be sure. I am including a screenshot I took of that chat. About 20 minutes later, I received my cancelation confirmation. Rather than cancel my cruise and apply the FCC, the agent canceled the reservation and refunded it to my account, and processed the fee for over $2k. This is not a transaction I agreed to. I agreed to a cruise credit for the full amount paid. I did not authorize a refund with a fee applied. I was unable to resubmit my claim to guest relations. It appears they only allow one submission per confirmation number. So I had to wait for them to email me their resolution. They did on March 31st and denied my request. I immediately responded saying I did not authorize the cancellation the way it was done and included my screenshot of the conversation with the chat agent. It has been over two weeks and I have heard nothing from them. At this point, I would like the rest of my purchase refunded or at the very least a cruise credit for $2698.80. My original purchase was for $4,725.35, and I was only refunded $2026.55. Norwegian claims the difference is a cancelation fee. TLDR; Norwegian's employee provided wrong information causing a cancelation I did not consent to.",Customer service rep made a mistake and now I‚Äôm out over two thousand dollars,,kwhitt78,,28,2022-05-08 14:51:19

Cruise,"In April 2020 when cruises first began getting cancelled, cruise lines started offering free on-board credits if your cruise was cancelled via COVID-19. I feel lucky I'm one of those people who is OCD and likes to read the fine print...ps along with caring about contagious-spreading diseases and everyone's safety üëç

I purchased a Carnival cruise in May 2020, for 4 day cruise to Cozumel-Miami for my husband and myself in November of 2020.
CRUISE CHARGES¬†Cruise Rate $238.00¬†¬†Taxes, Fees &amp; Port Expenses $229.28¬†¬†Total Cruise Charges $467.28.

Via COVID-19, I was able to cancel this cruise just a couple months after booking(*with no cruise-insurance necessary), get a full refund credit, and also received $300 in Covid-cancellation on-board credit. (*I chose to not immediately get my refund...knowing we'd eventually go on a cruise. Cool Carnival savings account, but this had been an option if I wanted) Reading thru the CX paperwork, I needed to rebook the new reservation by 3/31/22 in order to keep the on-board credits. So, watched rates very carefully the next few months... 

Rebooked the new option - 4 day Miami-Bahamas for 2
CRUISE CHARGES¬†Cruise Rate $150.00¬†¬†Taxes, Fees &amp; Port Expenses $285.72¬†¬†Total Cruise Charges $435.72

Clearly the taxes are a bit different, per countries, BUT, $75 per person for a 4 night cruise. PLUS, the $350 (* they had added an extra $50 with the new room choice) on-board covid credit from Carnival. I plan to get off the boat, after having a very fun cruise, and maybe even being due a refund via the ""cruise cost overpayment"". Because of things possibly changing and rules potentially becoming tighter, I purchased cruise insurance this time around..if we needed to CX again and still be refunded. ü•≥

Cruise," I am new to cruising and will take my first cruise (which is on Royal) in the fall.¬† I want to try different types of cruise lines, and Virgin obviously stood out as something different.¬† If it matters, I am in my early 30s and male.

There are a lot of things that are really appealing--the fact that it is closer to an adults-only all-inclusive than many other lines, the focus on quality dining over quantity dining and the somewhat adventurous menus, fun-but-not-crazy party vibes, and the good pricing for solo cruisers, which I may well end up being.

That being said, there were a couple of things that were really concerning to me.¬†¬†

1.¬† The vibe being too sexual.¬† The sex pack in the cabins, the ice cream parlor named after cunnilingus, and the ""burlesque""/sex-advice show, and marketing about free condoms are all¬†*major*¬†turn-offs for me.¬† And while I like some drag queens fine (shoutout to Trixie), drag acts are often very sexual.¬† I have also seen videos and reviews of some of the activities, like a shakeweight fitness class, that were¬†*also*¬†laden with innuendo.¬† 

I assume this is not ubiquitous on board and maybe just part of the marketing push, but I want to make sure that there are, in fact, activities and stuff that are not very sexual.¬† I also want to make sure that I will be able to get through the cruise without being frequently asked about my own sex life and hearing about others'.¬† This may make me a prude, but whatever.¬† I am okay with a sex joke here or there but I doubt I will be buying tickets to Avenue Q anytime soon.

2.¬† ¬†There not being enough stuff to do.¬† I realistically will do at most one, maybe two fitness/wellness activities a day.¬† The website and other reviews are a little vague on what else there is to do.¬† I see trivia, bingo, and shows mentioned, but it still seems like the sea days are a bit empty, especially for a solo cruiser and the fact that concern 1 above may eliminate some stuff.¬† I would read for a couple of hours a day and probably take advantage of the arcade/game room a bit.

First time on a cruise, wanted to get first hand accounts on what to expect from boarding to arrival. For those who have been on this cruise, I have questions for you!

* What should I expect when boarding? Do they open luggage and check or screen somehow?
* Are we allowed to bring water aboard?
* From looking at the dinner times (5pm,8) generally which is best in terms of less crowd?
* when porting, do you/have you taken part in the activities that are on land? if so, did you sign up through the RC website or other ways?

I have a million other questions but I will stop here, any important info would really be appreciated. 

For context purposes, Family with two daughters ages 11,8.

Not interested in pool parties.  Love the idea of a balcony on Princess, but also love the serenity of HAL, and also like the idea of spending an extra day in San Diego to visit the zoo.  The rooms in Royal Princess look much more modern and appealing.  Have never stayed in an interior room.

I can already see the menus for our trip, and the food sounds better/more upscale than carnival, although that doesn‚Äôt mean the quality is any better. Or is it? 
 
I noticed some things are way more expensive, such as the steakhouse. Carnival‚Äôs surcharge is $38, but it‚Äôs $53 on Serenade. Is it really that much better? The deluxe beverage package is slightly more than cheers, but RCI seems to have higher quality liquor. However, they cap their individual drink price at $13, whereas on carnival it‚Äôs $20, iirc

I'd rather go through the old locks vs the new ones just cause I liked being right up against the walls and watching the mules and the ship move through, but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out which ships can/can't go through the historic locks. I know that the large ships like the NCL Encore can't , but other than Princess nothing seems to identify which lock it's going through. 

Does anyone know somewhere where I could find out which ships go through which lock or where to find a list of the ships that go through the old locks? I was looking at NCL cause he's interested on going on it, and I'm assuming that the Pearl can go through the old locks because it's &gt;100k GT, and the Island Princess that I did it on before is around the same GT, but I also don't know if that means it can or not. 

Only other thing I know is that most of the premium lines and above, or whatever is in the class above Celebrity, Princess &amp; HAL, have mostly small ships and go through the old locks, but those are like waaaay out of our price range.

Cruise,"Hi everyone, this Sept/Oct, my wife and I are going on a cruise. We have never been to Europe and I want to try to make the most of each port we will be in. I know with a cruise you can't ""see it all"" but I am just wondering if anyone else here has been to the ports/countries as well and did some sort of excursion that you really enjoyed. We are sailing with NCL and I am ok to book excursions through the cruise line or also book things separately through trip advisor or something else. Here is a breakdown of our trip:

Start: Barcelona - we will have 3 days in Barcelona before our cruise. We are planning to see some of the main sights/buildings. My uncle gave me a Rick Steves' pocket Barcelona book that has  some walking tours and things to check out so we may look at doing things out of there.

Day 2: Cannes, France. We arrive at 9am. We depart at 6pm

Day 3: Florence/Pisa, Italy. We arrive at 6am. We depart at 6pm. We sail into Livorno

Day 4: Naples, Italy. We arrive at 11am. We depart at 8pm

Day 5: Messina, Italy. We arrive at 7am. We depart at 3pm

Day 6: Kotor, Montenegro. We arrive at 1pm. We depart at 7pm

Day 7: Corfu, Greece. We arrive at 9am. We depart at 3pm

Day 8: Santorini, Greece. We arrive at 1pm. We depart at 9pm

Day 9: Athens, Greece. We arrive at 7am. We depart at 6pm

Day 10: Mykonos, Greece. We arrive at 7am. We depart at 2pm

Day 11: At sea

Day 12: Rome, Italy. Arrive at 7am. This is where the cruise ends. We will have 3 days here before we fly home.

&amp;#x200B;

Our goals are to explore a bit where we can. We are planning to see Pompeii but aside from that, we are pretty open. We are hoping to eat some off the ship to have more local food options. We are both into the old architecture so Barcelona and Rome will be great to see the buildings. We like to be active and both are totally fine to walk long distances, etc.

Just hoping some people may have been in these ports before and have thoughts on what to do.  When we were on a Hawaiian cruise, we found that most ports had a hop on, hop off bus waiting at the port. We did this in a couple ports to try and cover more ground and not spend so much money through NCL. Does anyone know if the same type of thing exists throughout Europe? Some of the NCL excursions mention it but not all.

Thanks!

Given where I live, the offices are closed so I‚Äôve tried to look and see if I could find any information online about this and I‚Äôm coming up blank. Could it be a glitch on the page or something? Should I wait it out or try calling customer service? Has this ever happened to anyone?

Cruise,"Going to preface this by saying a few things. First, haven‚Äôt been to Coco Cay since 2018 and you had to tender. Second, pretty low maintenance, just want to sit on a beach, read my book, drink and get in the water occasionally (I‚Äôm 34 years old FYI). Third, I was on Harmony at basically full capacity, docked with Independence and didn‚Äôt dock until 930am

My impression is that I won‚Äôt be in a rush to get back to Coco Cay, love the private islands but will choose labadee over Coco Cay every day. It felt crazy busy here, didn‚Äôt see a bartender on the beach once other than to sell the Coco Locos in the mugs and even then only saw them twice. 

Had to walk to a bar where you had to wait in line for only two bartenders and it seemed to take them a really long time to ring in orders with the cards compared to on ship.

All the bars closed at 3 except the Oasis Lagoon swim up bar that was crazy busy. Oasis Lagoon was pretty cool but again way too busy. 

Has anyone had the same experience at Coco Cay? Not a terrible time but enjoy Labadee way more.

* 5 or so undershirts
* How formal of formal wear do I need? Is there only 1 formal night on a 5 day?

* I figured for shoes I would have sandals, slip ons, sneakers of sort, and then do I need need a dress shoe?
* I don't do well in hot humid weather so I am going to feel gross most of the time.  What face and body sunscreens do you use to minimize that greasy nasty feeling?

Cruise,"
I will NEVER give my money to this cruise line EVER AGAIN. I booked a 4 Night Bahamas cruise on April 7 for my brother and I. Everything seemed to be going great. We had to do some considerable preparation for this cruise, but we decided it would be worth it to be able to go on our first cruise. I have a full time job, so as soon as I booked the cruise I put in for my time off and it got approved. My brother just got out of college and was supposed to start a new job, but decided to post pone his start date to be able to go on the cruise. Aside from this, we had to schedule and attend many appointments including a Covid vaccine appointment and DMV appointments. I also had a few questions regarding travel documents that I wanted to confirm, so I had called the cruise line a few times during the process. Each time I called I waited around 2-3 hours for someone to finally answer the phone. I understand having a high volume of calls because there is nothing the cruise line can do about that. What I have a hard time with is waiting their long wait times just to talk to one of their customer service representatives who has no idea what they‚Äôre talking about and is very hard to understand. After each call, I felt like I had no more clarification than I did before I called. I had no problem sacrificing my time and resources doing these things because I knew they were all necessary for us to be able to enjoy our cruise. I went on the app and completed check on April 18 and got my boarding pass. The boarding pass did not have our room number on it at this point, but when I went to check on Sunday it was assigned. We were getting really excited because we felt like everything was finally in order for us to board the cruise. Our cruise is scheduled to leave on May 9, so it is 10 days away from now. I went on the cruise line website and logged in on Tuesday to book the last of the packages we wanted to add on. When I clicked on the cruise planner it said I had ‚Äú0 Upcoming Cruises‚Äù. I thought this was strange because for the past month I was able to view all of my cruise information there. I thought maybe it was a glitch with the website, so I went to the mobile app to see if I could view it on there. The same thing happened where I couldn‚Äôt view my cruise or check-in. I decided it must be a glitch with their system, so I went to look it up and see if anyone else had experienced similar problems. From what I found, people were saying it had happened to them, but that the issue resolved itself in about a day. I waited until the next day to check again and the same thing was still happening. I decided to wait another day until calling the cruise line and waiting the insane wait time to talk to a customer service representative. I called on Thursday because the issue was still not resolved and I was getting worried. I waited to talk to CSR and when she answered the phone I told her I logged in to finish my bookings and that my cruise wasn‚Äôt listed on my cruise planner. She responded by explaining to me that my reservation was CANCELLED. I was SHOCKED because this was definitely not the response I was expecting. I told her there must have been a mistake because there was no way either of us cancelled the reservation. She then explained that since it was a group booking, I would have to contact my travel agency for further information, so I called them and waited a while to speak to one of their CSRs. When I finally got ahold of them, I explained the situation and the CSR said that there was no problems with my booking on her end, but that she would check on the cruise lines side. She looked into it and saw that the booking was cancelled on Monday, April 25. I explained to her that I hadn‚Äôt done this, so she had me check my email for any communications, which I had been doing regularly leading up to this. I looked through both of our emails including our trash and spam folders. I couldn‚Äôt find any communication telling me that my booking had been cancelled. The only email I ended up finding was one from Monday saying my internet package was cancelled, and that the full amount was returned to my payment method. I checked my bank account and I hadn‚Äôt received any refund. At this point I am very confused and frustrated, but I am trying to remain calm, hoping everything will get resolved. The travel agent told me she was going to put me on hold and try contacting the cruise line. We waited a while until someone finally answered, and they told us the I had called on Monday to cancel the reservation. Again, I was SHOCKED because there is absolutely no reason either of us would have called and cancelled. The travel agent asked me if I had called on Monday for any reason and I told her no, the last time I called was on Thursday, April 21 to ask a question about travel documents. At this point, I have been on the phone for about 5 hours, and I just want this problem resolved. Finally the cruise line CSR gets back to us and says that they are unwilling to reinstate our cruise, but that they can offer us future cruise credit. I DO NOT want future cruise credit. What I WANT is to go on the cruise that I have poured so much time, money, and resources into. The travel agent then explains to me that there are no more of the interior room I originally booked, and that I would have to pay the current rate for an ocean-view room. There is no way I am going to give them ANOTHER CENT. So now my options are pay more money for something that isn‚Äôt my fault or receive a FCC that is impossible for me to use. In a few months I will be going out the country for the next two years, making it IMPOSSIBLE to redeem a FCC, therefore causing me to lose out on all of the money I have paid so far. NO WAY! They finally contact a cruise line Manager and they explain that they will need to pull the phone records and look into it further. The Travel Agent tells me that she will contact me sometime today (Friday) with more information, but that this whole process is most likely gonna take longer than the 10 days I have left until my cruise, but that she will try to get the process expedited. One thing that I would like to make clear is that the travel agency representative was AMAZING! She was so kind, helpful, and patient. I am so grateful that I had her advocating for me in this situation. In the end, what I want is for the cruise line to make this situation right. At the least, I want to get on my planned cruise for the price I paid. And if that‚Äôs not going to happen I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I am just so unbelievably disappointed in this Cruise Line and I hope that they do what it takes to make a VERY inconvenient and unfortunate situation right. Leading up to my cruise, I was raving about all of the amenities and deals on the cruise that I was excited for to my friends and family, but now there is NO WAY I will EVER recommend this cruise line to anyone looking to book a cruise, unless this situation is RESOLVED! 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Can anyone offer advice on what I should do if they won‚Äôt give me my cruise or my money back?",CRUISE LINE SAID I CALLED AND CANCELLED MY CRUISE‚Ä¶.I DID NOT!,,Weary-Caterpillar-63,,11,2022-04-29 18:17:50

&amp;#x200B;

We haven't been to hawaii in a long time, but have gone to the carribean/bahamas about 3 times. I want to move to vancouver, so it would be handy to spend a few days there after the Hawaiian cruise.

Were planning on staying an extra week or so in honolulu/vancouver, or florida for the carribean.

&amp;#x200B;

The Caribbean cruise has more stops and colonial sites, but I don't really want to sit around in Florida.

The Hawaiian stops appear to really favor nature/swimming/snorkeling tours - but I'm more of a history person. I don't really want to do a lot of swimming, and I think I might get exhausted if i only do hiking.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in love with the celebrity ship. Royal carribean's is slightly older and doesn't appear to have the same amount of entertainment facilities.I'm not a huge fan of the rooms on the radiance. 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like a real toss-up. I prefer celebrities' ship and itinerary, but I'd much rather spend the non-cruise time in hawaii/vancouver over florida. That said, theres a ton of orlando we missed. Harry potter and star wars to name a few.

I prefer Polynesian/Asian food over Caribbean if that helps.

We are planning Alaska vacation last week of June and of course, cruise is one of the lucrative options plus we stay in Vancouver, we see the cruises dock from our window! However, as I started plotting the places of interest , I am having second thoughts about the cruise stops.

Some of the items on my list are:

**Juneau Area**

Mendenhall Glacier

Tracy Arm

Klondike Gold Rush (not a must)

Glacier Kayaking (hopefully I can find some tour options)

**Anchorage**

Denali National Park

Railway ride from anchorage to seward

**Seward/Whittier**

Kenai Fjord National Park

Looking forward to relaxing, easy hikes, view of glaciers (very dreamy!)

&amp;#x200B;

The problems I am seeing

\[1\] None of the cruises go through all these places and all of the cruises have stops like Ketchikan, Skagway that are only famous for being cruise stops.

\[2\] Juneau is only a day's stop and probably won't be enough?

\[3\] There is one cruise which I found who has a lot of my fav stops but I really dont want to pay this much üòÇ

I know I won't be able to do Hubbard Glacier without a cruise :(

Katmai National Park also looks amazing but the connectivity doesnt seem great from either a cruise or by road.

What tipped the scale for us (obviously all your suggestions) less hassle to rent a car, and book flight tickets, Less driving, the cost of everything at this time was coming out equivalent to the cruise booking.

Cruise,"I just came of MSC Magnifica, and I really wasn‚Äôt impressed by the food. I‚Äôve cruised several times with Costa and NCL, so I guess that‚Äôs a fair comparison.

First, of the four food areas at the buffet, mostly only one was open (and if two were open, they were mirrors of each other).

Breakfast was pretty good, so no real complaints - though I was a bit disappointed that ‚Äúcustom‚Äù omelettes were only available in the restaurant, not at the buffet area.

But the lunch and dinner buffets were pretty bad. The pizza was great, but apart from that, you had a couple of pre made salads that seemed to be made with leftovers from earlier meals (lunch had a good salad bar though), one pasta meal with pretty overcooked pasta, one roast station and nine extra warm‚Ä¶ sides, I guess. Like 3-4 meats and fish, a couple of veggies and 1-2 things like casseroles. The meat was dry, and stuff was either over salted or totally bland, and usually overcooked too.

The worst thing was that the warm meals seemed to repeat all the time. 

Is that normal? Or is it some current weird cost saving trip by MSC? I realize the ship sailed on 2/3 capacity, but only offering 1/4 of the potential variety seems really not cool.

I mean, we cruised with Costa during the pandemic too, and it was miles ahead of what we got on MSC now. It made us very wary of choosing MSC again.","Is the food on MSC this bad, or was this a fluke?",,Krian78,,7,2022-04-27 18:43:39

Cruise,"Hi there. Canadian here going on a round trip Alaskan cruise out of Seattle, with a brief Canadian port of call in Victoria, the night before, before heading to Seattle to disembark and driving back home to Canada the next day.

IIRC (it has been a long time since I last cruised), you can buy your duty free stuff anytime on the ship but you don't get it until your just about to disembark.

I also know that the rules on duty free alcohol are that you have to be out of the country for 48 hours. However, I have a 5 hour stop in Victoria before heading back to Seattle. 

Does anyone know if the duty free will get processed in Canadian customs in Victoria, where I will have reached 48 hour + threshold or will it only get processed upon my final return visit home which means despite spending one week (minus 5 hours) in the US, I won't even reach 24 hours? 

Would like to take advantage of buying the much cheaper duty free booze and take advantage of much higher threshold on duty free spending ($800 vs. $200 for under 24 hours), if possible.

Last time cruising, I was 15 with a 13 and 10 year old brother. My 16 year old brother also is on the Autism spectrum and wants nothing more than to sit on the balcony 24/7. This is honestly a big reason I think my parents booked the presidential suite, because of how big the balcony is. Anyway, I think the REAL reason my mom is hesitant to buy the wifi package is because this time my cousins are coming (16 and 14). They are girls. If you know anything about a 16 year old girl and her phone, THEY DON‚ÄôT STOP USING IT. I think my mom doesn‚Äôt want any of us using wifi because if she sees us using wifi, she‚Äôll beg my uncle to buy her wifi and be glued to her phone the whole trip. My question is, if my mom won‚Äôt buy a wifi package for me is there anyway I could buy it for myself? i‚Äôm 17 and don‚Äôt have the credentials to the cruise booking, nor would I sneakily want to log in regardless, but I saw that the social wifi package is only $6.80 per night (more on board). At this point, I don‚Äôt really care how much it costs; I make my own money and am willing to spend my own money. If I were to go down to Guest Services with cash or a debit card, is there anyway I could buy wifi without my mom finding out or seeing it on the room details? If she sees is after the cruise, I don‚Äôt really care, but I don‚Äôt want her finding out while we‚Äôre on the cruise. I just don‚Äôt know if it would even be possible in the first place to buy wifi without a room to my actual name.",Wifi plans on cruises,,Gavin_G3,,37,2022-04-25 00:06:10

Cruise,"Hello-

I just got back from my first Princess cruise since the whole Medallion thing started, and it has me wondering whether or not I stiffed the crew?

My fare was a Princess Plus fare that included drinks, tips and wifi. The cost for this was $40 a day. The drink package alone would have been more than that, so it was an incredible deal and I jumped on it, but keep that $40/day cost in mind we'll come back to it.

When I cruise on Carnival and the drink package, with every drink I order I get a paper receipt where I can add a tip. Typically I add $1-2 per drink unless the server goes way out of his way for me, where I tip more. I know that the package itself has a gratuity added as well, but I still think the people working the ship deserve more, so I always tip more.

Cut to Princess this week. I go to order my first drink at the pool bar, and the bartender hands me the drink and says ""Have a great cruise!"" I asked if I needed to sign anything, and he says ""No sir, it all goes on your medallion."" and I said ""But how do I tip you?"" and he says ""It is included in your drink package."" ""But I want to tip a little more."" and he says ""Well, if you would like you can add cash...""

There's the catch. I didn't bring cash. I was on a cruise and figured I'd just be tipping and adding it to my room account.

&amp;#x200B;

SO, here is where the question comes in:

How much are these hard working people getting in tips from my cruise? The ""Plus"" part of it was only $40 per day. The daily auto-gratuity is $14.50. The drink package gratuity (18% of $59.99) is $10.80. That means of the $40, at least $25.30 wen to the crew, right? 

Specifically for the drink package, does the beverage staff just divvy up the $10.80 between all of them equally, or do they get a percent of each drink I ordered even if I didn't pay for it separately?

Just wondering if they are being compensated properly. I just want to be sure Princess is giving their staff all of that money from Princess Plus and not using it to short change them!",How are Tips Distributed on Princess,,wallyboag,,2,2022-04-24 19:54:09

I want to preface by saying I (M29) have never been on a cruise of any kind, but my partner (F34) has. We're currently toying with the idea of going on a cruise during the July/August time frame this year. 

A little about us: We're both fairly active, and want an experience that gives us plenty of options to be active. We're into hiking, biking, rock climbing, frisbee, disc golf, kayaking. Those are the more frequent activities that we partake in, but we're really open to anything. We're both very big on good eats/fine dining, wine tasting/drinking, and welcome the idea of fun and new experiences. 

While it's going to be very hard to meet all our ideal conditions, here are some that we're spitballing. We fully understand that we won't be able to find the perfect cruise that meets all our conditions, but the more conditions that are fulfilled, the better. They're the following:

* Flexibility and freedom is a big driving factor
* Having plenty of options for food/drink
* Cruises that include physical activities/experiences
* Preferably departing from the west coast, or east coast, USA (would like to avoid the southern coast during this time of year)
* Stops at Alaska or Hawaii preferred
* 3-4 night itineraries preferred, but would possibly be open for a 7 day itinerary
* Ability to debark the cruise ship on land for a good amount of time

Cruise,"Hello all! My girlfriend and I (24 and 30 respectively) are first time cruisers and need help deciding between 2 carnival cruises. The first option is an 8 day cruise on horizon that visits the Abc islands at 64/night (excluding taxes/port fees), while the second is a 6 night cruise on magic that visits cozumel, costa maya, and Belize city at 48/night.

From my understanding, the two ships are very similar. Horizon is newer with additional features such as imax, thrill theater, sky ride, and music review. Magic is older, but was recently refurbished and has basically the same amenities but also has all the art related classes and exhibits. Additionally, magic has the superior atrium (not sure how much that matters) along with better seating for the theater and comedy club.

Speaking of which how many seats did the those venues lose on the horizon? Is it really an actual issue or were enough seats lost that it‚Äôs a big deal?

The above listed differences seem rather minor (though please say if they are not!), and as such the biggest differences are ports and duration.

As first time cruisers, would you suggest a 6 night or 8 night cruise? Personally, I‚Äôm leaning towards 8 night, but I‚Äôm not sure there will be enough to do on the horizon to keep up entertained.

Also, and probably most important, which itinerary of ports do you think is best? We want a mix of beach and exploring a cool, cultural landscape.

Cruise,"Thinking of taking a cruise with my husband next year in the Caribbean - looking at either Mardi Gras, Magic or Horizon. He does not do pools or sunbathing. Being from a Caribbean island ourselves, he loves the sea and any kind of boating, but hates pools and just sitting around. I know a cruise vacation is not entirely suited to him, but he knows how much I want to go, and the trade-off is that he gets to spend our next vacation doing something totally his style, even if it's not 100% mine. :)

So with that said, what will our typical sea days look like? We will get up early on port days (he is a 5.30 a.m. riser normally) but will maybe party a bit the night before sea days so we can sleep in a bit. Then it's brunch time. After that what is there to do? Mardi Gras has Bolt, Horizon has SkyRide, but those don't take long to do. I was thinking maybe some mini golf or bean bag toss type of stuff. A game of pool? We could do our own drink and snack hopping around the ship, especially the first sea day when we are still getting to know our way around. In the afternoon we could see an IMAX documentary or movie on Horizon or watch Family Feud on MG. Maybe have a rest in the cabin, though I understand there aren't many options to view on the TV.

My family of 4 (two adults, one 8 year old, and one 12 year old) are trying to figure out which cruise to take in June.  Both go to Bermuda and the Joy also goes to Norfolk.  When my husband and I took our honeymoon, we were on the Carnival Valor and I was pretty seasick.  I also had an ear infection so that may not have helped.  One of my biggest concerns is suffering from seasickness next time around (although I loved cruising otherwise).  

Both ships have a ton to do for my kids.  Both are similarly priced (although Norwegian seems to have more things we'd have to pay for on the ship).  Given my seasickness and the ages of my children, what do you think are our best options for sailing?  Which rooms would work best for us?  I've looked at the family suite but am afraid it'd be worse for motion sickness because it is interior.  Does anyone have any experience with those rooms?

Cruise,"Hello,  


I have never been on a cruise, but I'd like to go once in my life because I like big ships.  Does any itinerary like this exist?  


1.  The ship must be big.  Very big.  I'm thinking at least 150,000 Gross Tonnes, if not larger.
2. There needs to be really good food.  It doesn't have to be fancy gourmet.  It can be donuts and burgers and fries, but it has to be really good.
3. They need to not charge me a huge extra supplement for being one person.
4. The cruise line must not be tacky or trashy or a retirement home.  It can be downscale or upscale.  Families or a booze cruise.  Modern or classic.  Relaxed or traditional.  Does not matter but not tacky, trashy, or everyone on there is a boomer.
5. Lots of public spaces to explore and chill.
6. At least one, if not two days of just sailing so I can explore the ship.
7. This is the big one:  I don't want to spend money to visit a bunch of places for 8 hours, and not really get a chance to get to know any of them, so the itinerary must either:  
A.  Visit places that I can see and experience all that I need to see and experience in one day--So NOT Barcelona, Rome, Naples, Santorini, Corfu, San Juan, Dubrovnik, Split, Cozumel etc.  Some places I've seen cruises go to that seem to fit the bill are some of the Portuguese small towns, some of the smaller Greek islands, Bruges, and some of the Norwegian fjords.   Exception is at the beginning or end of the itinerary where I can extend at will.  
OR  
B.  Visit places that require more than one day but I've already been:  I've seen the Netherlands, London, Paris, Venice, Stockholm, Visby, and Gdansk (among common cruise ports).

I will steal a few seconds from you to tell my misadventure with MSC, which, due to what happened, I do not recommend as much.

I book a 15-day cruise with MSC Seaview to the Caribbean in November 2021, departing January 2022.

I paied about 3200 Euros immediately as requested by MSC and book the flights for departure.

After a month I get an email that changes the port of departure from Martinique to St Maarten, and also changes the day of departure. I write to MSC customer care who tells me: ""If you booked the flights you did it to save money, now it's your business"". I inform the customer care that I booked on my own to spend a few more days on the islands before and after the cruise and I spend another 900 euros on flights to rearrange the departure change.

After a month I get another MSC email saying: ""We are very sorry but we are canceling the cruise"". You can choose a voucher for another cruise or a refund.

You can imagine my happiness for having thrown away the money for flights and flight changes, which will be unusable. Well, I ask for a refund, it was December 16, 2021.

My main question is: can anyone give me a short breakdown of the drink package options on RCL and CCL? I‚Äôve been watching some cruise vids and noticed one couple mentioned that they were able to purchase an NA package with Royal to enjoy virgin cocktails, coffees and teas, etc. This would be perfect for us, and I wouldn‚Äôt mind just paying cash for any alcoholic drinks I might want.

Cruise,"First time cruiser here. 

Aside from the usual coverage from travel credit cards, are there additional coverage that I should look at? E.g. COVID related, and other cruise related coverage not usually covered by the credit card? 

My credit card covers the following: 
* Travel Emergency Medical Insurance
* Trip Cancellation / Trip Interruption Insurance
* Flight Delay Insurance
* Delayed and Lost Baggage Insurance
* Travel Accident Insurance

Also, do you know if your credit card covers COVID-19? Tried reading their FAQ, but I'm not sure I understand it clearly. 

We're traveling from Canada (Vancouver). Our starting port would be LA, then ends at Vancouver. 

Their credit card insurance FAQ section says:
---------
&gt; Will I be covered because my trip had to be cancelled or was interrupted as a result of COVID-19?

As of March 13, 2020, the Government of Canada has advised Canadians to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. Please visit the Government of Canada‚Äôs¬†Official Travel Advisory page¬†for the most up-to-date information.¬†

(But non-essential travel outside of Canada has already been lifted!!!)

Trip Cancellation/Interruption Insurance

As a result of the travel advisory, customers who have booked a trip before March 13, 2020, may be eligible to submit a trip cancellation/interruption claim for travel booked on eligible Scotiabank credit cards, subject to the conditions below.¬†

Before making a claim, please first inquire with your travel provider regarding credits and/or refunds available. Coverage is only available for non-refundable expenses.¬†

(!!!!)*
For trip cancellation/interruption claims as a result of COVID-19 reasons, the following circumstances must be met:¬†¬†

The Government of Canada has declared an official travel advisory risk level of 3 (avoid non-essential travel) or risk level 4 (avoid all travel) for the travel destination¬†¬†

The trip was booked prior to the travel advisory being announced¬†¬†

* Any trip booked on or after March 13, 2020, will not be eligible for trip cancellation/interruption insurance while the travel advisory is in effect

etc.

--------
(!!!!)* This section throws me off because it seems that you can only make a COVID-19 related claim if you travelled while there is a travel advisory high risk (level 3-4), which doesn't make sense to me.

Pretty much everyone over 16 has had their second jab, and ads for cruises on Odyssey of the Seas have been popping up everywhere (and cruises are not something I looked up since before my honeymoon almost six years ago) In any event, my wife and I just booked a 5 night cruise that was going for a shade over 1,800 USD *for a balcony stateroom*.

Cruise,"I'm sitting here in the long beach terminal waiting to board Carnival Radiance, having just made it through my first ""post covid"" check in process.  I wanted to share some information about the testing route we went with since it was such a big question mark for me as our embarkation date approached.

We had read articles about Carnival offering $10 tests in the cruise terminal on selected cruises, and ours was one that qualified.  I looked into this option, but I was never sent the link needed to apply, and when I called Carnival they only offered me the $150 option, which was a non starter with 5 people. I spoke with a few people that HAD gotten the $10 tests, but they told me they had a doctors note. I don't understand why there isn't better information on who and what qualifies for the $10 tests. 

So we decided to go for testing ahead of time. In my area, rapid travel tests are $180. If you lie and say you ""have symptoms"" you can get free tests, but its a mixed bag on who offers rapid and who offers the ones that take 48-72 hours. You also have to get insurance involved in some cases which I didn't want to do. 

We settled on proctored home tests. These are tests you administer yourself, on a video call with a clinician.  There are several approved brands according to Carnival's website.  I don't want to promote any certain one, but for reasons you'll see I want to tell you I went with the BynaxNow tests from eMed. I bought a 6 pack for $150, plus shipping it was about $175. 

Adukts have to make an account and download the Navica app. Children jave to have a managed account under an adult.  This step wasn't super easy, but after going through the FAQ section I figured out how to do it. Its much easier to create managed accounts on a laptop or desktop instead of the phone app.

The testing process itself was pretty easy.  I did myself first, and I found that using a laptop was the easiest way.  You push the laptop back on your table so you have a work surface in front of you. When instructed, the proctor will tell you to tilt your camera down so they can see you removing the contents of the test box. There's a couple things they will need you to hold uo to the camera such as the test kit expiration, a QR code, and your ID. They walk you through the steps to prepare the test kit, then they ask you to tilt thw camera up so they can watch you swab your nose. Then you tilt the camera back down, go through a couple more steps of activation, then you leave the camera pointed at the kit for 15 minutes. A new proctor will connect at the end of the 15 minutes and you will hold the test up to your camera for them to interpret the results.  They email your results that minute as well as update your navica app. 

Testing kids is the same process. You just sit right next to them and do everything for them on camera. Once they are done being swabbed you can cut the kids loose and continue the process with the proctor.  

One major issue: We had 5 people and instead of ordering 5 tests I got a 6 pack. That turned out to be a good move because one of the kits was defective.  We might have had to scramble to find a local rapid test is we hadn't gotten a spare. They did send me a replacement but it wouldn't have arrived in time for this trip. 

Overall, I was happy with the process and now that I've been through it once it will be our preferred method for any future travel with testing requirements.  Once you get everything set up, subsequent testing is a breeze.  In our case, proctors were available 24/7 with no wait times.  I did read articles about 3 and 4 hour hold times when these tests first came out. 

TL;DR:

Proctored home tests were easy and affordable, with a couple issues that were workable. We will use this as our go-to testing method for future travel.",A full breakdown of our proctored home covid testing for those that are researching the option.,,robinson217,,8,2022-04-18 17:48:33

Just found this sub and went through the limited wiki and had some general questions regarding cruises

I understand each cruise liner will vary but my wife and I are entertaining a couple of long overdue vacations now the kids are older.

- I got very sea sick going on a fishing charter a few years ago. I'm getting mixed feedback on cruise ships from ""it's too big to notice"" to "" everyone gets it, take some meds"" how is it? Those who get sea sick?

- inclusions what is generally included with your fare price? I've been reading through some sites and some hint at food being included from some places onboard and then charged from others? True false? On that we aren't big drinkers but love coffee and some soft drinks...are these available in drink packages or included?

- what's a humble amount to take for spending? We never tend to go wild but do want to do some things. Is there free things onboard?

- we love a chill and Netflix session of an evening. What facilities are in the rooms for this? Any tips...yes we will be enjoying the cruise itself but we do like to wrap up an evening with a show or something.

-Any hot tips from seasoned cruisers you wish you knew beforehand?

- what's wifi like I'd at all on the ships? I work on occupation that may require me to check emails and some other thibgs

Thanks in advance, and I know all cruises vary",Cruise virgin questions,,GrandOccultist,,13,2022-04-18 03:10:04

Cruise,"Need your feedback on the below three options. Tell me your thoughts.

Given the hotel and plane ticket costs from Seattle...I figured i might as well book two cruises to Alaska. The first cruise will have Glacier Bay and the second cruise will be cheaper since it won't travel to Glacier Bay. I don't know if I can afford to go back to do another Alaskan trip...might as well bunch it all here. What are your thoughts? Is this a terrible idea?

We are thinking inside cabin as it‚Äôs obviously the cheapest! 

Food:
I‚Äôm confused about the food choices, the buffet and main restaurant is all I can have as a inside cabin person?   The other 2 restaurants are for the retreat guests?  What other food locations is included, also is the menu rotated?

What prices are the speciality restaurants?

Drinks:
I‚Äôm on the basic package if I go for a more expensive drink am I only paying the difference?

Also things like the martini bar come at a higher price? 

Entertainment:
They are quite vague about this, what type of entertainment is there?

Is there any majors dos and donts when going on a cruise?

Also how is the pool never rammed out?  Every review video I‚Äôve seen the pool has been very quiet.

Cruise,"Hi everyone! I recently discovered cruising this year and love it so much, I offered to take my mother (42) and my younger 9yo twin sisters on a cruise. However, while they are excited my family can be very finicky and Im having a hard time deciding on the best cruise for them despite all the homework and research I‚Äôve done. We live somewhat close to FL and would be driving in. Sisters aren‚Äôt vaccinated, mom and I are, but we‚Äôd consider getting them vaxxed if necessary. 

About us:

- The ship is overall more important than the ports. 

- Room type doesn‚Äôt matter, mom doesn‚Äôt even want a balcony per se for child safety reasons. 

- On RCL it was cheaper to book 2 separate rooms. Connecting rooms would be nice but Im fine if Im separated from the group if we can communicate easily. 

- My mom is a big germaphobe and is going to want a newer, modern, clean ship. Nothing dated and minimal smoking preferred bc we have allergies. 

- She likely won‚Äôt eat in the buffet so sit down restaurants/grab and go restaurants are a must. Bonus if they‚Äôre complimentary or there‚Äôs a specialty dining package. 

- Mom prefers coke products and cans. (We‚Äôll bring our own cans onboard if possible.) 

- Moms idea of fun will be eating and drinking by the pool, mini golf, comedy shows, and some slot play. Will probably get her an internet plan. 

- Sisters (and I) are going to want to be in the pools all day so we want the best aqua park available, but the more overall activities/things to do together the better. 

- A kids club so mom and I can go to adult comedy shows and the girls can make friends would be nice. 

- I‚Äôve already done Carnival and NCL so prefer MSC or RCL, but they come first overall. 

- Cruise Fare budget is preferably $2000 max, so I prefer either a cheaper cruise to spend more on onboard activities/dining or a cruise with the majority of things included. 

Options
- All cruises are stopping in at least the Bahamas, Grand Cayman, and/or Jamaica. All RCL cruises stop in Coco Bay. I included the room type I get with the price. 

5 Day Carnival Sunshine ($1150)
Room Type: Ocean View or Spa Inside

5 Day Carnival Sunrise ($1300)
Room Type: Ocean View

4 Day Freedom of the Seas ($1300/$1500)

4 Day Independence ($1600/$1900)
Room Type: 2 Interior Guarantee/2 Connecting Promenade 

6 Day Carnival Horizon $(1750)
Room Type: Balcony or below

7 day MSC Seashore ($1800)
Room Type: Balcony or below (same price)
This is the only ship I think I‚Äôd be willing to go over budget for since it intrigues me. (And then I wouldn‚Äôt need to do it again later.) 

5 Day RCL Mariner of the Seas ($1900)
Room Type: 1 Interior Guarantee

I have two Celebrity Cruises FCCs that I am not able to use by the deadline of December 31, 2022. 

They already rejected my refund request but they advised me today it would be transferable as long as I provide an email providing authorization of the transfer.  You would be able to call Celebrity to verify the credit before we do any transaction.  They told me a booking would be needed first in order to transfer the credits, along with the Booking Number and Names of Travelers.  We could even call them together if you like!

My goal obviously is trying to sell them, understanding that I will not get the full value back obviously.  So a chance for a nice discount here for some lucky cruisers!

Cruise,"Following up on a very informative post from Cleric\_Giggles  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/tje0hd/being\_covid19\_positive\_on\_a\_viking\_river\_cruise/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/tje0hd/being_covid19_positive_on_a_viking_river_cruise/) . I posted a reply but after hearing there are presently 950 covid + cases being worked by Viking, I'm moving to a new thread to hopefully help others. 

Background:

‚Ä¢ This is for the Swiss Alps to Paris, Paris extension Viking river cruise

‚Ä¢ I tested positive (day 5 sample, notified on day 7). My wife tested negative at that time.

‚Ä¢ We are from Ohio, United States

‚Ä¢ Our airline tickets were through Viking

‚Ä¢ I did purchase Viking travel insurance for this trip and paid all costs with AMEX platinum for secondary coverage.

‚Ä¢ We're both fully vaccinated and boosted (twice, for a total of 4 shots each). Neither of us have caught COVID before this point. Symptoms are mild and possibly related to the fact that my 4th shot was 2 weeks prior to infection.

TLDR:

Our situation is ongoing. We completed 7 days of the cruise, confined to cabin day 8 and now 3rd day of quarantine in Frankfurt. The (half) cruise was excellent but the quarantine experience has been difficult (no contact from Frankfurt Viking local host for 3 days, after 6 phone calls to Viking provided #, straight to voice mail (in German)). Hilton Frankfort City Centre quarantine hotel is nice (single room for wife and I). No results provided for 2 additional tests we took on board or assistance offered (no contact). Antigen test provided on 3rd quarantine day ‚Äì we are now both positive. Called Viking Customer Support because of lack of local host support and we were told we would get a call back today. There are 3 COVID specialists at Viking Corporate and they are busy. Our cruise had 10 + Covid cases (20 people affected out of 106) and Viking rep said there have been 100 cases fleet wide \~this week. Covid incidence in Germany is much higher than at home. Over 100 positive cases at our hotel today. In summary ¬Ω cruise was excellent, evolving quarantine experience has been frustrating.

Update 1: Contacted by local Viking host 3rd day afternoon. Provided info needed and will deliver food/supplies within 60 euro stipend per day. He said Viking was adding staff because of the COVID incidence wave and indicated they were now working 950 cases (I assume in Germany). Very relieved to have info and supplies option while cooped up in hotel.

How things worked out financially (preliminary):

‚Ä¢ We have Viking travel insurance for this trip and paid all costs with AMEX platinum for secondary coverage. I read that Viking insurance provides coverage to 5 days beyond planned end date.

‚Ä¢ During our first call to Viking customer service, they indicated others with Viking travel insurance were fully reimbursed so we shall see.

‚Ä¢ The private travel (somewhat harrowing ‚Äì see below) to the hotel was covered by Viking. I was asked for my AMEX to cover the quarantine hotel costs and lunch and dinner room service. Breakfast is provided daily (included in rate) and is very good. I have been told that record of my + test needs to filed with Viking insurance provider to be reimbursed for costs incurred.

Story:

Quarantine Day 1: Viking requires a saliva based PCR test every morning (due by 0730) to verify covid negative status. On day 8, the manager came to our room and related I had tested positive. We were asked to remain in our cabin. During that time, staff brought us lunch and dinner. Our hotel manager was also very professional. He did indicate we needed to be patient (5 days for next test and 10 day quarantine). I don‚Äôt think that was accurate per my research of local rules. We packed and were given private transport to Frankfurt quarantine hotel. It was a 2 hour ride and the driver texted, hands free voice calls, video call and ate a full meal during the trip which at times was concerning but I don‚Äôt fault Viking for this. They just booked a local guy. We were dropped off at check in at the Hilton Frankfurt City Center contrary to what our hotel manager had explained (not a contact free check in). I provided my AMEX for hotel, meal costs. We were provided a single room that is nice. My wife can somewhat isolate in a separate bed. Attempted to call the local Frankfurt Viking host with phone number provided 2 times to no avail and no calls back.

Quarantine Day 2: Attempted 4 more calls to local Frankfurt Viking rep, straight to voice mail (left voice mails with call back #s), no calls back. Because of lack of local Viking host contact we just do whatever the hotel asks us to do. Called Viking Customer Support line and rep was very caring and helpful. She did recommend going out and getting our own re-tests but I‚Äôm not allowed out so that isn‚Äôt an option. She filed a case with Viking COVID specialists to call us back tomorrow. There are 3 COVID specialists at Viking Corporate and they are busy.

Quarantine Day 3: Called hotel front desk and it turns out he (said) the hotel is in contact with Viking and he related they would contact us this morning and maybe provide a follow up test today (4 days after the + sample). One of the local hosts apparently is ill. We again did not receive a host call as of early this afternoon. Surprise knock on the door, and we were nasal swab antigen tested by a non-English speaking aide. Results were provided in 10 minutes. Now both wife and I are positive. I asked for the test results and certificates which indicated I had a stronger positive than my wife. Aide indicated they were very busy, over a 100 positive cases at the hotel today. Aide also indicated we would be tested every 2 days. Would have preferred daily but this should keep us updated on infection status.

Edit 1: day 3 afternoon update: Received a call from local Viking host. He was super helpful. Apparently we have a 60 euro stipend for food/drinks so we ordered that he will deliver tomorrow.

Summary (to date):

Viking local host support for quarantine has been non-existent (until 3rd day afternoon). Hotel has been nice, although it‚Äôs a single room for my wife (negative as far as we know ‚Äì now positive) and I‚Äôm paying. I‚Äôm guessing that Viking wants me to pay so that costs are incurred by the insurance company once my claim is filed. It‚Äôs been very frustrating not getting any local Viking local host help (not getting 4 previous test results after the positive test and no further testing, until this afternoon). I researched the local rules so I know what I can do without Viking local host help. Local Viking host established contact 3rd day afternoon and situation improved dramatically (info, supply options). I think there are a relatively large number of cases and this may be impacting our quarantine support. 

Update 1: Viking adding staff to work 950 cases. Will keep updating.

Recommendations:

1. Do not leave the ship without getting all of your test results or making sure they will be provided later (if possible). We are missing 4 test results conducted on board after the positive result. Having the additional test results are very important: a) level of infection (increasing or decreasing) and if partner remains negative. Get all your test results in writing.
2. Have the Viking ship hotel manager confirm contact with the Viking local host or you may have a broken handover like ours.
3. Contact Viking Customer support. They are in sales but they answer the phone and can get you to the corporate COVID reps (in our case TBD, expecting call back). They are busy.
4. The ship management will not help you as soon as you leave the boat. They are busy running the cruise and dealing with additional new cases.
5. Work with COVID quarantine hotel front desk. They are helpful.
6. Provide your member status with the hotel for potential perks. I have been unsuccessful linking my Hilton Gold status (online chat and front desk multiple attempts), but if I do figure this out, I may get some food and drink comps.
7. Get trip insurance and secondary coverage (Hopefully that works out)
8. Try to contact local Viking host ASAP and get best info and food/supplies within 60 euro stipend per day.",Being COVID-19 positive on a Viking River Cruise (another experience),,fredq2,,10,2022-04-15 16:32:16

How does their drink package work? Is it per person?

Do they have the similar walk in freestyle kind  of dining like NCL?

I have a 13 y/o who really liked the entourage teen club on last sailing. I am guessing similar on RCL?

Any other big differences?

Both ships I am looking at seem to be comparable in terms of on board amenities (NCL Joy and Adventure of the Seas).

Cruise,"Hey cruisers! I‚Äôm going on my first RCL in August with my fianc√©e and 2 year old son. I had a few questions regarding the main dining and deluxe beverage package.

Main dining:

‚Ä¢ Is there a price to dine at the main dining hall?

‚Ä¢ Are we able to attend breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the main dining hall?

‚Ä¢ Since the main dining hall has pre assigned seating, are we able to view our seats ahead of time before our cruise dates?

‚Ä¢ Is the wait for food long at the main dining hall? Asking because my son will go crazy if we‚Äôre seated for more than 1-2 hours, but maybe we can sedate him with some Cocomelon..


Deluxe beverage package:

‚Ä¢ Is there a waiting period in between drinks that I order? For example, I ordered a cocktail but didn‚Äôt like it. Do I have to wait a certain amount of time to place another drink order?

‚Ä¢ Is my deluxe beverage package applicable when ordering a drink while I‚Äôm having a meal at the main dining hall? 

‚Ä¢ Does the package come with the freestyle coke tumbler?

I got the the final screen to enter my credit card info and pay the $400 deposit. After selecting ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù I got an error message, but my card was charged $200. Weird, since it was supposed to be $400. No email confirmation came through. I call in and wait on hold for 3 hours until I have to hang up and go to bed. I‚Äôm not super worried. I‚Äôll call and find out what‚Äôs up in the morning. I was wrong‚Ä¶.

It takes three tries on Monday to get through. Finally get through and they tell me that I have one room and it‚Äôs an interior. What the fuck? That‚Äôs not even one room at the level that I booked!

During the process, we get disconnected, I‚Äôm at work, I can‚Äôt call back that day, so I call back on Wednesday.

Cruise,"My wife and I decided to book a 7 night Caribbean cruise end of May/beginning of June; this will be our second cruise.  Our first cruise was a short cruise to see if we liked cruising (we loved it), and we did no excursions.  This time around we'd like to book some excursions. Seems like the consensus from what we've heard is that we should not book through the cruise line, but book on our own.  We're hoping for some advice from frequent cruisers out there.

Here are the ports we'll be sailing into:  
Montego Bay (arrive 8:00 AM - depart 5:00 PM)  
Grand Cayman (arrive 7:00 AM - depart 4:00 PM)  
Cozumel (arrive 10:00 AM - depart 6:00 PM)

My wife would like to have a beach experience at one of the three ports - hit up a beach with others (we're in our mid 40s), drink, soak in the sun, etc. She loves to be around and to look at the water but doesn't necessarily like to spend a lot of time in it.  I love everything about the water. We both would like it if we could ""experience"" Jamaica while we're in Montego Bay - I've been to Jamaica on vacation but my wife has not, and while she knows she won't get much out of 9 hours there she'd like to kind of ""preview"" it to see if she's like to return for a longer vacation down the road.

I'm worried that we'll end up with the Chef's Table experience on the Nassau port evening.

I called Carnival, and the guy told me that it **is** possible that our reservations would fall on the Nassau day. He said I wouldn't be told what day the reservation is until the day before the cruise starts...

The group would be two couples with three minor children between them.  One child will be 14, so an adult for cruise pricing purposes.  Ideally we‚Äôd like to have three sleeping rooms, one for each couple and one for all three kids together.  The kids could be in a seating area rather than a separate stateroom, but we‚Äôd really like to have the three sleeping areas completely separate rooms with doors.  

So it sounds like a two-bedroom suite or a one-bedroom suite plus connecting room would be best, but we‚Äôd rather not pay a premium for the extra suite perks ‚Äî we just need regular rooms but a lot of them, if that makes sense.  I thought about getting two connecting balcony rooms for the parents and putting the three kids in a nearby interior room, but I don‚Äôt think the other parents would be comfortable with that.

We're cruising NCL Getaway from Southampton, UK and would like advice on pre-cruise testing. we are going to be in London 4 days before embarkation which means we must test in UK.  Unfortunately, NCL is absolutely NO help when it comes to where we can go to get tested only saying the site (pharmacy) must be a ""verified 3rd party""  whatever that is.  we cannot test at home and bring results as test must be done 2 or 3 days before embark.  When asked about the cost to just test at the port ( at our expense) the NCL rep said they have no idea and to just call London to ask. He said he heard its very expensive, but doesn't know anything else.   Also they don't know what UK pharmacies are approved but said people test at local pharmacies ie, Walgreen, CVS.  unfortunately, Walgreens and CVS are not in the UK - although we've heard that Boots pharmacy could be an alternative... not sure.  

Surely this has happened to others coming into the UK a few days early and needing to test for boarding! if so, please advise...

 1.  How much is it to test at the Southampton UK port?

Previously we‚Äôve taken two cruises with Celebrity, one Mediterranean on the Equinox and another aboard Summit in Caribbean- both were fantastic. Neither of us have cruised with any other lines. 

For Alaska is seems like our best options are Celebrity Solstice out of Seattle, this would require a flight for us and since it‚Äôs a 7 day round trip we‚Äôd probably spend a couple days exploring Seattle before or after. Other option is Ruby Princess out of 
San Francisco, we‚Äôd only need to Uber to the port from our home in Silicon Valley- it‚Äôs a 10 day trip.

&gt; After months of working towards restoring the Carcross and Fraser Train Service Combination, we unfortunately must announce that we are unable to provide these offerings for the 2022 Season.  We have delayed this difficult decision for several months in the hopes that we could find a workable solution for all involved and provide passenger service on these international routes.  The **challenges of logistics, restrictions, and uncertainty around wait times would have made it impossible for us to provide a consistent high quality service without delays and would create significant disruption** to the passenger experience.

&gt; We respect and appreciate the time and efforts of our communities, staff, partners, customers, and governmental agencies at all levels in both Canada and the United States over the last year to try to bring this to fruition.  Though we could not complete the task in time for this season, we will continue to work together towards restoring this service for 2023.

The wife and i are thinking about doing our first cruise. Narrowed it down to Alaska. Most likely going with princess, specifically the crown princess ship. The room we currently have reserved is p333, i believe on the 5th deck if i am remembering correctly.

Cruise,"We've cruised mostly Carnival, but also NCL and Princess (and very much looking to try Royal Caribbean).  On our last Carnival cruise in February we were joking about their platinum award level gift of a beer koozie, as we collected our free bottle of water.

We've always said that we'd pick the cruise we want based on price, ship, and itinerary and not chase brand loyalty because the frequent cruiser benefits seemed like such a joke.

I think I was looking at things wrong, as our Carnival VIFP deals are so good right now that we've just booked a couple of cruises where the fare is actually less than the taxes and port fees (for 7 and 8 day cruises).

I'm curious what other people think of the loyalty programs.  We try to use the same airline and hotel chain to gather points, but up until now we haven't put much effort into consolidating loyalty to a single cruise line (although we've accidentally sailed Carnival more than others due to price and destinations).",I think I was wrong about cruise line loyalty programs.,,FireBuilder86,,20,2022-04-08 21:38:35

Cruise," 

TLDR: Don't do it.

I was looking for more information on this excursion before booking, but could not find any reviews online at the time. I am writing this review to help anyone else looking. I tried leaving a review on Norwegian's website, but it looks to be broken.

Details: The excursion offers round-trip motorcoach transfers from Port Canaveral‚Äôs pier. The details say you will be dropped off ""close to the main entrance"" but that is incorrect. You are dropped off at the Transportation and Ticket Center. After you get dropped off, you will have to take a 15 min monorail ride to Epcot or a 10 min monorail or ferry ride to Magic Kingdom. (Epcot and Magic Kingdom are the only parks offered). (This is assuming that you catch the monorail or ferry right when you walk up.) The duration is listed at 7 hours, but it is not made clear when booking that it includes the transportation time and that the bus has to be back an hour before any non-NCL excurrsions.

Our Plan: The excursion from NCL was $60 and the park ticket to Epcot was $140. $200 total/person. (You have to purchase the park ticket beforehand or risk the park filling up). We got our excursion tickets in our room the first day. On the ticket, it repeated the ""7 hour duration"" and only then informed us that the 7 hours included transportation (1 hour each way). We were prepared for this and we were satisfied with a well-planned out 5 hour Epcot day. The ship was to arrive at Port Canaveral at 1pm and depart at 9pm. The meeting time for the excursion was 12:45pm.

Our Experience: We met in the theater at 12:30pm, with all of the other transfer excursions. We waited over an hour and a half with no real explanation from the staff. They reassured us that this, ""wouldn't impact the time that we had for the excursion."" We were finally told that we could go after every other tour was called. (Even though many had shorter distances to travel than we did). We got on the bus at 2pm. The local tour operator was very knowledgeable and friendly. He noted points of interest on the way and gave tips on how to get the most of our time at the park. He informed us that the meeting time to be back on the bus was 6:15pm. People were rightfully concerned since we were told the ""all onboard"" time for the boat was 8:30pm. I overheard him tell one guest that 7:30pm was the contract time that he had to have us back by. Since we were running so late, he offered to contact the ship to see if they were able to extend the time. When we arrived at the Transportation and Ticket Center he said that he was unable to get in contact with the ship, so we would need to report back at 6:15pm. When he let us go, my friends and I ran to the monorail only to find that we had just missed it. We had to wait another 10 min for the next one to arrive. By the time we got to the park entrance, we had 2 hours before having to go back to the bus. For $200 per person, we were able buy food (we were starving after the unexpected extra 1.5 hour wait) and ride two rides. Our only solace was the thought that, ""at least Norwegian will refund us for the transportation, after all, we were told it would be 7 hours and even if the ship had been on time, we would have only had 6 including transportation"" that is why you buy from NCL directly, to grantee your satisfaction with the excursion. When we went to complain the next day, we were informed that they were not responsible for ship delays and that even though the ship was departing at 9pm it was their policy to get their excursions back at 7:30pm. They did not offer us anything.

Summary: At the current cost of Disney, Norwegian should not be offering this excursion. I assumed that we would be guaranteed the ""7 hour"" excursion we paid for but that was not the case. I do not recommend this excursion.",Norwegian Cruise Line: WALT DISNEY WORLD THEME PARKS - TRANSFER ONLY Excursion review,,kyleseverino,,7,2022-04-08 20:45:44

We're currently booked in a boardwalk balcony, all the way at the back (10729). From the reviews I've seen it should be an awesome view, and I don't mind the walk at all. (Generally on a cruise, I need those extra steps lol). 

This past week the sailing has been on a super sale (for high summer prices) and I could call and try to upgrade to a junior suite for very little if any cost. I've never sailed in a suite before. It would be extra room obviously, and a bigger balcony - probably nice to have with the kids along.

Cruise,"Hi I am a bit confused by the explanation of the ""Perks Extra"" on Celebrity Apex 7 nights:  


 **Perks extra:**

&gt;What's Included  
&gt;  
&gt;$225 shore excursion credit - you will be contacted within 3 business days after booking to select your excursions.  
&gt;  
&gt;Premium Wifi (one device)  
&gt;  
&gt;One dinner in a specialty restaurant of your choice - reserve with the Maitre D' once onboard.  
&gt;  
&gt;Laundry service (one bag).  
&gt;  
&gt;Perks Extra with drink includes a Premium Drinks Package.

It costs 60$ per person per night so 840$ for us.

What I don't understand is what I get exactly, since I have the ""All included"" thing that celebrity does.

1. 225$ shore excursion credit, is this per person? or for the whole party (2)
2. Premium Wifi -&gt; we get 2 wifi (basic) so not sure if I need that anyway but ok (do people use netflix on ship with that?)
3. One dinner -&gt; so I guess this is dinner for 2, someone knows how much does it normally cost for 2 people?
4. Laundry -&gt; ok I guess
5. **Perks Extra with drink includes a Premium Drinks Package -&gt;** What does it mean? do I get upgraded from the classic package to this package for 2 guests?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry maybe all of this is super obvious for you, but it is my first cruise with celebrity (2nd in life) and their paragraphing is not too obvious for me, I know I can call them and ask but English is not my native language so it is easier for me in writing

Cruise,"At the outset, if you have any strong recommendations about anything, just skip this OP and let us know in your comment what we should do!

We are a group of four to six friends in their late 20s and early 30 who have settled on an RCI Symphony of the Seas trip (7 days) in the Caribbean in August 2022.  We were wondering what things (if any) we should pay attention to or take advantage of on what is basically our first cruise. We picked RC/Symphony because it seems to offer pretty much everything a standard cruise could offer, so we will get a good sense of the cruising experience.   Additional info, if it helps:

* We are split between drinkers and teetotalers.  The drinkers generally plan to get the premium drinks package.
* We are fine with the basic dining options.  A couple of us are potentially interested in specialty restaurants, especially since the packages seem to be relatively low-cost for us (we live in NY so are used to outrageous prices for food).  If it affects anything, some of us are admittedly completely fine with any food as long as it is edible, while some of us will splurge for Michelin-star restaurants and the like.\*  Our group is fine with some people paying premium while others just enjoy the complimentary food.
* We are mostly okay with just chilling by the pools and doing standard daytime stuff, but if there are particular things we should pay attention to, let us know!  Pretty much everything--simulated surfacing, laser tag, rock climbing, etc., is attractive.
* In terms of nightlife, we are not super interested in comedy, but we are definitely into dance venues (especially EDM, R&amp;B, etc.), shows, and any other entertainment worth experiencing.
* Our cruise will definitely stop at CocoCay--is the included package enough?  Should we splurge on the waterpark?

&amp;#x200B;

\*To the extent that anyone has any insight on this across cruise lines, we would appreciate it.  Cruise food reviews seem all over the place.  For example, people tend to praise Carnival food, but I am a bit iffy on that after watching YouTube reviews that showed Carnival charcuterie and cheese compared to RC--the former was slimy (charcuterie) and processed/cubed (cheese) whereas the latter had both charcuterie/cheese formed into plates with garnishes like pepperoncini.",Symphony of the Seas--novice cruisers; what to do and buy on board?,,OpeningChipmunk1700,,21,2022-04-08 04:22:22

Cruise,"So I've seen several articles about a Carnival pilot progrom for $10 covid tests at embarkation on a handful of shorter cruises through april. I'm sailing on Radiance out of Long Beach on the 17th with 5 people.  In my area, rapid travel tests are $150+ a PERSON! That will cost me almost as much as the cruise. 

Here is the only thing I could find on Carnival's website https://imgur.com/a/SBKXkol. They mention the $10 tests which you can sign up for with a linked email. I never got one. They then offer $100 tests that you can sign up for easily through a link. I called Carnival and the lady had no idea about the $10 tests. Then I watched a YouTube video of a Carnival Radiance guest saying ""Just get in this line over here at boarding for a $10 test"". He made it sound like he made no reservations. But I don't want to risk it. 

Overall I'm a little ticked that Carnival is leaving it up to guests to figure this out. Other lines have this situation covered and I'm not thrilled that I have to come up with something on my own. In my area I've been ""rapid"" tested before and the results were delayed for days due to a backlog. My worst fear is spending $750+ to get tested, only to get denied boarding because the results aren't in. Or drop that kind of money only to find out I could have spent $50 at the port.

I have a credit to spend and was thinking of an easy trip out of our home state (La) would be better. I understand the Valor is older, but would we still enjoy it? We aren't expecting the Mardi Gras.

Cruise,"Hello everyone, I am planning a cruise out of port canaveral in September of this year and I have narrowed down my option to two choices that I am having trouble decide between. Both options are similar price points and 4 day cruises that sail to the Caribbean. 

Option A:  Carnival Freedom Cruise with a balcony room

Option B: Royal Caribbean Independence of the Seas Interior Room

&amp;#x200B;

Both options seem good to me on paper but my real question is where would I get the most value for the buck ? Thank you all in advance.",Help me decide ? Royal Caribbean or Carnival,,No_Raisin_3075,,11,2022-04-06 19:46:50

Cruise,"I have heard that cruise lines may drop the prices in the weeks and months leading up to embarkation day to try to fill the rooms of a ship.

I found a cruise ship that fits my schedule, but its still 9 months away. Is it worth waiting to the final months to see if they drop the price? Or should I just go ahead and book it now?

Cruise,"I am looking into cruises for me and a couple friends (we are late-20s &amp; early-30s, pretty low-key and non-party people).  4 people total.

**Question 1**

Several of our group have a nonnegotiable requirement of being able to read in (relative) peace and quiet for at least part of the day (not evening).  I am wondering what spaces are available on the larger RC ships for that.  Is the pool deck too loud/rowdy?  From my research, the Solarium seems like a place where that could happen while still getting some sun.  Are there other spaces, either exterior (or sunny) or interior?

We do not need perfect peace and quiet, but we tend to go to adults-only resorts, so the music is not insanely loud, there are not people screaming or splashing everywhere, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 2**

We have no experience with cruises beyond one of us who went on a Carnival cruise a long time ago.  It was (apparently) very rowdy and unpleasant.  We think that the diversity of activities and the size of the larger RC ships would be a good introduction to cruises.  We would be sailing for a week or so in the Caribbean.

We have an okay budget ($1-2k per person).  Is RC a sensible choice?  My main concern is that we have some more thrifty people in the group who will be reluctant to pay for *anything* on board, so I want to make sure that the activities that are included are varied/fun enough to occupy someone for a week (bearing in mind that we do like simple pool stuff).

If there are other lines or ships we should check out, let me know.

I‚Äôm leaving for my spring break vacation for a 7 day on the Norwegian Encore tomorrow (I was supposed to be on the escape). I was wondering if anyone could tell me of their experiences with the ship. 

What were the crowds like? Spring break party kids or Old timers? Was there enough room to sit by the pool? What was the entertainment like? Food recommendations?

Anything helps. I‚Äôm just trying to pass the time between now and then. I haven‚Äôt been on a cruise since middle school so I‚Äôm pretty excited.","Norwegian Encore, haven‚Äôt cruised in a while",,PersonManX,,9,2022-04-06 14:16:55
Cruise,"We booked b2b (7 day and 5 day) cruises on Oasis of the Seas. This was our first cruise with a toddler so naturally it takes a few days to recover from traveling and get into a schedule and groove. Day 5 was the first day I felt like I was going to start relaxing. I was looking forward to the 5 day second cruise and because I had that to look forward to, sort of put off the things I really wanted to do until then. 

Also on day 5, we march to the MDR to covid test for the second cruise. Then, it happened. My antigen test came back positive. We are immediately isolated in our room pending a retest and now they test my toddler. We are both positive. My husband is negative. We were quarantined in our room for days 6 and 7, and taken off the ship and told we cannot join our second cruise. They put us up in a Miami hotel for 5 days and said we can spend up to $100 per day on food. I'm keeping all my receipts and will be submitting all of our receipts after the 5 days are over. Allegedly they will refund us for part of the cruise too, prorated to the days we missed. 

All in all, RC has been incredibly generous with how they handled this. As a business owner myself, I know that they are certainly not obligated to help us cover these costs. 

At the same time, I feel like I'm going through the stages of grief. Lol! I am sooooo sad we missed our cruise. I am so mad I put off doing what I wanted to do. I'm pissed that this is ironically the cruise I booked 3 years ago that got cancelled and rescheduled 3 times because of covid! Also the odds of being the less than 1% of people getting sick is just crazy. 

I hope you all have wonderful cruise vacations coming up. Whether you care about covid or not, be careful because it still exists and is just waiting to ruin your trip.","Welp, the worst did happen...",,anonymoususererror,,74,2022-04-06 14:06:35
