TravelHacks,"Note: I am NOT referring to hidden city ticketing. 

There used to be a service called FlightFox that I used a few years ago and they kept find inga way to reduce costs on roundtrip flights by adding a 3rd leg.   
For example I needed to fly from EWR to FRA and back direct. I wanted to fly outbound on Jun 20 and return on Jul 2, non-stop only. What they suggested was to add 3rd leg to fly from EWR to SJO on Jul 8th (6 days after my return), and it would reduce the overall cost by 50%, compared to just booking round trip the days I needed. After I returned, I called United to say I couldn't make my last leg, and they even refunded the taxes for that leg.  
They've even been able to find ways to add a completely unrelated flight to reduce costs, e.g. instead of adding EWR to SJO, they might add UIO to SJO as an example.

My question is, does anyone have any idea how they were able to figure out what to add as a 3rd leg to reduce the price? Thanks!",Adding legs to reduce cost,,Lambo_J,,0,2023-04-02 00:22:08

TravelHacks,"tl;dr at bottom for top 3 of each category

I took a 16 day European trip with my wife from U.S.A through England, France, and Germany and back to U.S. But in Germany we had to stay longer as strikes cancelled my plane and could not get out till days later.

What I bought

just before the trip. While I’m not happy that I bought so much for a trip. A lot came in very handy and some obviously won’t have to purchase again.

These are listed in most useful at top to least useful at the bottom.

1. Vessi Everyday Moves shoes. Man for me personally I can’t give these shoes enough credit. They saved my feet so much through all the walking we did. It makes me rethink my work shoes. After work the bottom of my feet will be sore and kill me. But these shoes I never had feet that hurt, yes, my calves did, but not my feet. Also my feet stayed dry as it rained for about 14 of the 16 days we originally planned. Link: \[https://vessi.com/products/mens-everyday-move-onyx-black\](https://vessi.com/products/mens-everyday-move-onyx-black)

2. Rain jacket. Yeah I never had a rain jacket. Sure I have umbrella’s but where I live it only rains maybe 100 days of the year. So I just need an umbrella. The rain jacket was so nice to have as I didn’t have to juggle an umbrella in crowded touristy areas. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CPLW4L3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CPLW4L3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

3. Airalo Esim. I bought a regional Airalo esim that worked all over Europe for the 16 days a 5gb is perfect as long as your not doing a lot of wireless calling or video calling. It was easy to install and I have done it for Mexico before and will continue to buy in the future. Link: \[https://www.airalo.com\](https://www.airalo.com)

4. 1 Lightweight water repellent travel chino pants. I wear blue jeans all the time and have for the past 28 years. But I needed something more lightweight as I was trying to keep 15lbs and under in my carryon for Singapore air. These pants are amazing. The are comfy, a tad stretchy, quick drying, water repellent, and have zippers on the back pockets that have a small flap over them to better conceal and another “hidden” pocket on the side of the leg. I am definitely buying more. Link: \[https://a.co/d/bRfsuBN\](https://a.co/d/bRfsuBN)

5. A universal plug adapter. Was definitely useful as it had 4 usb plugs + type C and works for US, EU, UK, and AUS. Would be nice to have a second one. Maybe more of a dumb one in case of electronics malfunction. link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095BJFBW9?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095BJFBW9?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

6. A 10L sling bag for personal item. I wanted a personal item bag that would fit on pretty much every single airline as best as I could. My bag is 9.84” x 3.9” x 15.4”. I like the sling as I could easily swing it around to my chest and easily grab my water bottle for quick drinks. The second best part of the size was it fit under the small space under the seat of the ICE train as well. The other nice part was when I was carrying it around in the Louvre my shoulder was getting sore and I can easily change the strap to go over a different shoulder. I like this bag. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GSTM8G8?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GSTM8G8?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

7. A luggage scale. While I didn’t have to do carryon only. I wanted to and the airline Singapore like a few others restrict a carryon to 15lbs. So I bought one and knew exactly how much my carryon and personal item weighed. I also brought it with me on the trip. So when I fly back I can rearrange things that I bought (I also packed an extra bag in my carryon as well). Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0822GDHYJ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0822GDHYJ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

8. A new sleep mask. So I have bought a couple before hand but never found one that I really liked. The first one was a sleep mask with a outward mold for the eyes so your eyelashes/eyelids don’t tough the mask. But the straps on these would hurt my ears. So I bought one that was super soft and fully covered ears as well but it had no eye mold. Then I found one that has the eye mold and the strap doesn’t hurt my ears. So I’m happy with this one. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R558RLV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R558RLV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

9. Selfie stick/tripod. I bought this specifically for Paris and England. So my wife and I could take shots of us in front of major tourist attractions without handing our phone to a stranger and then them running off with it. Definitely came in handy. If you are anti selfie stick bring/buy a disposable camera just for the photos that you want taken of you in front of an attraction. This way they are less likely to steal it. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K5QVJV3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K5QVJV3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

10. Laundry detergent paper sheets. Yes this is laundry detergent that is like a paper sheet. You just tear off how much you need depending on if a light load or normal. This was nice as some of the Airbnb or the hotel we stayed at either had no laundry soap or only gave us 1. Some of the washers in Europe were so small that we had to do multiple loads (even though we didn’t bring much). So this was nice to have. There are many it there this is just the one we bought because of a sale. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B81BPZNS?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B81BPZNS?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

11. A small clear travel pouch for toiletries. I wanted a small pouch just for some long haul plane essentials. In this pouch I had a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss picks, moisturizer, deodorant, ear plugs, travel size body wash, and a couple cough drops (if needed). I was trying to find a particular size and I looked up clear pencil case pouches and found this park of four. I like it because it fits in my personal bag right next to my Beats over the ear headphones and my wife’s Vera Bradley tech case perfectly (I measured Before hand) Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098NVNWYX?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098NVNWYX?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

12. Compression socks. Don’t know if they were necessary but my wife needed some as she is pregnant and the doctor suggested them. So we found a pack of six and wore them on our long haul red eye flight. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F1LJPNN?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F1LJPNN?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

13. 1 ft 90° iPhone cords. Usually when I go on vacation I bring some 6’ iPhone cords so we can charge our phones by the bedside. But they can be too long when we’re out day tripping. So I wanted some short cords. Also my wife makes her fanny pack as her purse and there is a slot for her phone. But the phone won’t fit in with a regular cord as it has to be angled. So I got some 90° ones and have been really nice. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916VZJJ1?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916VZJJ1?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

14. Travel camping clothesline. I bought this in case if the Airbnb’s didn’t have a drying rack as some didn’t have dryers or the drying racks were not substantial enough. We used it once maybe twice. Was fine except a bit awkward to adhere it to something in an apartment that won’t break what it’s attached to because of the weight. We’ll see if this gets used again. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QKYGTT?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QKYGTT?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

15. Apple air tag. These were a Christmas gift, but we wanted some for travel in case we had to check our carryon luggage or if we brought checked luggage on this European trip (we didn’t check bags). But I put one in my carryon and one in my wifes. I slid mine in a zipper pocket in the back of my carryon to better conceal it. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

16. Travel floss pick case. Okay so these were the least necessary item on the list. It was just nice to have a case for floss picks and not having them jumbled in a bag.

I may need to sand down a piece of plastic inside the case to fit my usual generic ones.

What I ought

These are things that I should buy or consider on a future trip.

17. Travel insurance. For international trips and to cover what my travel credit card may not.

18. Vessi shoes for my wife. Her bottom of feet were hurting even with new gel insoles. My feet did not hurt with the Vessi’s I bought. Will be buying her a pair.

19. A packable waterproof backpack for my wife. We found out my wife’s current daypack is not waterproof.

20. A new raincoat for my wife that actually is waterproof

21. A waterproof backpack cover. Like a shower cap but for your luggage. We found out my wife’s packable day pack was not waterproof. Which got me thinking what if we were caught in the rain with our carryons. How would or clothes be protected if it was a hard rain and can’t get under shelter. Think I will be buying these and keep them with the bags. Link: \[https://a.co/d/5KyYFx7\](https://a.co/d/5KyYFx7)

22. A second but maybe “dumb” universal plug adapter. Link: \[https://a.co/d/gKDA6r8\](https://a.co/d/gKDA6r8)

23. An umbrella. We didn’t pack this due to constraints with weight and space. Though we did have rain jackets, until my wife’s jacket started ripping. We bought an umbrella in Paris.

24. Portable fan. While it was 40°F - 50°F in all the places we went. Most didn’t have air conditioning and it was still pretty warm at night where you toss and turn a couple times. Would have been nice to have.

25. More cough drops. I only brought just one single one as an emergency. Well near the end of our trip my wife needed some and 1 was not enough. Maybe I would do 4 but no more. We did buy a pack when we could.

26. More blister bandaids. We had 4 of them and used them up already. I would like to try a rule of 2 per person plus 2 more.

27. My quick dry towel which is a swim chamois. I had bought this for my Kauai trip as I like to wear rash guards and bathing suits so I can jump in the water any time and easily dry off. This little towel while small really soaks up water! But since it rained like 14 days of this trip it would have been nice to have so that I could wipe the water off a bench and sit down to enjoy a pastry with my wife or just sit and not in water. What actually I did was took off my rain jacket and laid it on the bench for my wife to sit. While I got a bit cold.

What I brought

Obviously what I packed for the trip but the list below does not include what I bought just before the trip. These are in order of most used at the beginning to the least used at the end.

Electronics

28. 2 power banks + cords. We use the smaller form factor power bank when out and about, but will use the bigger one on flights or at the airport. Bigger power bank Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MBQPV91?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MBQPV91?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share) smaller power bank link (does not come with wall adapter): \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXMF52C?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXMF52C?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

29. Three 6’ iphone cords (two for phones, 1 extra for TV adapter)

30. 1 iPhone to TV adapter + hdmi cable. I like having this so I can watch my favorite shows from my phone to the TV. Why not just a chromecast? Well I can’t chromecast my downloaded videos if wifi is spotty to the chromecast. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009WHV3BM?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009WHV3BM?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

31. Phone holder for flights. This was a nice upgrade from the flat foldable but only sits on a flat surface phone holder. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T8KL6C6?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T8KL6C6?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

32. Headphone splitter + 3.5mm to lightning cable converter plus 2 old wired apple earbuds. This way my wife and I can watch videos together that I downloaded on my phone.

33. Old beats noise cancelling over the ear headphones.

34. Travel power strip. This was a Christmas gift a while ago. Good if an outlet is to far from the bed or not enough wall outlets. Link: \[https://a.co/d/4tGSVkT\](https://a.co/d/4tGSVkT)

Extras

35. Refillable water bottle. I have a Travel Kodi cup that is similar to a Yeti.

36. Ear plugs (for the plane, but good thing I had them for an Airbnb in London as you could hear the road noise a bit to well.

37. Charles Schwab debit card. I got this because it refunds ATM fees worldwide and it’s another account that I can keep extra money in and if it ever gets compromised my main account at a different bank won’t be messed with.

38. A packable day backpack. This has been nice to take on day trips when I don’t want to unpack my personal item bag to go somewhere or to have another bag if we bought to much. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D373JGV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D373JGV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

39. 2 travel Kleenex packs. Runny noses and more.

40. Nail trimmer and clipper kit. Came in handy for when having a hang nail or a nail broke even though I clipped them before the trip.

41. Ibuprofen + melatonin. Many countries you cannot get ibuprofen over the counter. So good to bring your own. I always carry any pills in their original box (I do not like putting them in these travel pill cases.

42. Swimsuit (use for Baden Baden spa)

43. Moisturizing cream. For the plane trip with the dry air and during my trip if needed. Maybe get a solid lotion bar like this. So it does not count against liquids. Link: \[https://a.co/d/gHBFySV\](https://a.co/d/gHBFySV)

44. Face mask. Just in case if I cough on the plane or a confined transportation, or if some business still requires it.

Clothes (for 16 days, turned to be 19 with flight cancellations)

45. 6 underwear and socks

46. 4 t-shirts

47. 3 pants

48. 1 zipper sweater (It’s all about layers and getting those layers off easily.

49. 2 pajamas

50. 1 long sleeve shirt

51. 1 windpants/ lounge pants (did not use)

tl:dr

My Top 3 of bought, ought, and brought.

Bought: #1 Vessie Move, #2 rain jacket, #5 Universal plug adapter

Ought: #17 travel insurance, #18 Vessi for my wife, #19 waterproof packable backpack for wife.

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone, I am planning a trip to Spain for around 21 days from early to late August before I travel to Portugal (late August - September) and spend 21 days there with Porto as my final stop to finally end in Madrid for 4-5 days (mid-September). So, the Spanish trip will be like 25-26 days at the end lol.

I am having issues to find a way to go from Donostía-San Sebastián to Valencia and not pay exorbitant prices.  After Valencia, I am hoping to go Andalucía for 7-8 days. Do you recommend a way to go from and to these places? Below are some of my own travel hacks I found:

1. Night flight from Cologne to Barcelona from Germany with RyanAir.  Will get to Barcelona at 23:59 lol. Flight is booked, and found out that the **cheapest way to fly out of Germany to go to Barcelona is usually from Cologne** and (sometimes) Berlin.
2. Day 1 morning - Day 7 morning: Barcelona for a week, with a day trip to Sitges and maybe Girona (never watched Games of Thrones). Still undecided where else to go for a day trip. Recommendations kindly appreciated!
3. Day 7 morning - Day 13/14 morning: Basque Country.  I found a **\~18 EUR Renfe train from Barcelona to Bilbao!** ( I am quite a tripster, so I would like to spend time in Basque Country after being in the more touristy Barcelona.  Ideally 7 days in Basque Country but if anyone in here thinks 6 or 5 even days is enough, please let me know in the comments.  My final stop in Basque will be Donostía-San Sebastián for sure with a still undecided place to go in between Bilbao and Donostía-San Sebastián.
4. Day 13/14 morning: Train/bus from Donostía-San Sebastián to Valencia.  Trip is apparently 8-9 hours! Would it be too much? One bus company forbids food in the bus. I am thinking of flying but I am flying too much already in this trip… Australia to Frankfurt via East Asia, Cologne-Barcelona, Madrid to Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Australia… it’s a lot! So, I was thinking of catching the train from Donostía-San Sebastián to Zaragoza and stay the night there and then go to Valencia the next day.
5. Day 14/15 - 16/17: Valencia.  Is three days too much? I am only going because everyone goes there to be honest. I would end up in Valencia in mid-August. Heard the weather in August there will be more bearable compared to Andalucía, especially Sevilla.
6. Day 16/17 - Day 22/23: Valencia to Granada. Stay there for 2 days, then Córdoba (2 days) and finally Sevilla (3 days).  Either Sevilla or the beach town of Cádiz will be my final stop before I go to the Algrave for a week. Though I could potentially reduce it to 5 days and those 2 days to Coimbra and Porto.
7. Train/bus from Porto to Madrid. Stay in Madrid for 4-5 nights. Fly from Madrid to Frankfurt next day and from there back home.

Any tips on how to get out of Donostía-San Sebastián or even back to Bilbao to go to Valencia in mid-August will be appreciated. Unless it is best to skip Valencia this time around and fly straight to Andalucía (Sevilla most likely)?

I’ve flown from west coast to east coast plenty of times but this will be even long then that.

We were unable to choose premium seats at the time of booking but I’ve been checking every day to see if any of them open up. Some seats are occupied but others just have an x through them that say unavailable. What are the chances something opens up so we can get maybe at least pay more for leg room?

I am going to call the airlines today to ask about this but I was watching a YouTube video last night where a person was flying from Texas to London and she wanted a non stop flight because if checking a back with stops, you have to go get baggage from baggage claim go through customs and recheck back.
My flight has two layovers…if I check my bag and my airport, will I have to go get my bag at each layover and recheck them?? I tried googling this and was confused on the different answers.

The other being the flight that would land in San Juan gets there two hours before the other flight and aren’t connecting.

Hi all!

I am rapidly planning my Germany-Spain-Portugal trip, with the German and Portuguese parts of the trip being increasingly easy to plan. But I am having a hard time about planning my August and September trip to Spain.  I was wondering if this trip plan is feasable.  I am not counting the arrival night in Spain and the departure day from Spain to Germany and then home:

(Already booked) Night flight from Cologne to Barcelona from Germany. Stay the night in Barcelona.

1. Day 1-6: Catch a morning/afternoon train/bus from Barcelona to Donostia-San Sebastian. Stay in Basque Country for 5 nights; mostly in Donostia-San Sebastian and Bilbao but open for suggestions if feasible.
2. Day 6: Catch a train/bus to Barcelona. Stay in Barcelona and surrounding places for 7 days.
3. Day 13: Head to Valencia. Stay for 2 nights.
4. Day 16-21: Go to Andalucia (Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada, Jaen(?) and Cadiz) for 7 days. Last day in Cadiz. Next day bus to Faro, Portugal. Travel around Portugal for 21 days.
5. Train/bus from Porto to Madrid. Stay in Madrid for 4-5 nights. Fly to Germany the next day and from there back home.

* buy an eSim for my phone (from Airalo, data only)
* turn off roaming for voice, SMS, MMS, and data on my old Sim (on AT&amp;T) -- I want to avoid all roaming fees
* if possible (given the no roaming thing), send and receive calls and texts on my old phone number using the Airalo eSim
* be able to use Uber on my iPhone (they usually require a phone number)

There seems to be a lot of good information about configuring the eSim -- I'm not asking for information about that.

**Is the following correct / is there anything else I need to do**:  To turn off roaming I \_think\_ I just need to turn off data roaming on  my iPhone (I think/hope that turns off roaming for voice, SMS, and MMS  as well).

TL;DR — Book a refundable United flight, use the boarding pass to get into the United Lounge, and then cancel your flight for a full refund. 

\-----

Basically, my partner and I were flying Delta with an 8-hour stopover in ATL. We had two United Club passes that we wanted to use, but I had heard that they will ask you for a United flight boarding pass to allow you to enter the lounge. 

To get around this, I purchased the cheapest, refundable, one-way United ticket departing from ATL, and planned to show the boarding pass to get into the lounge before immediately cancelling for a full refund. 

This worked perfectly — I was asked to show my boarding pass to enter the lounge, after which I immediately canceled my ticket. I spent 6 hours in the lounge without any difficulty, and I was given a full refund within 48 hours to my credit card.

TravelHacks,"I don't own a car, and I regularly rent cars from the local airport. I do this maybe like 6-7 times a year. As I don't own a car, I don't have any regular liability insurance policy.

Every time I pick up the car, I have a conversation that goes like this.

Agent: ""What coverage would you like for the car?""  
Me: ""I decline coverage and assume all responsibility""  
Agent: ""What's your car insurance?""  
Me: ""I don't have any""  
Agent: ""You can't just go driving around without any coverage then!""  
Me: ""Actually, in our state you are required to offer minimum liability insurance on the car""  
Agent: ""Is that true? I think it only applies when we have possession of the car""  
etc etc... very awkward... until they basically give up and usually their mood changes and they're like ""I'm giving you the car, I don't want anything else to do with it""

What is the correct way to proceed with this conversation just so it doesn't become a thing every single time?

I've considered buying a non owners policy, but it would be more expensive than buying basic coverage ($9/day usually?) for all of the 15-20 days in a year that I have a rental car. But at least, with a non owners policy, I would build insurance history, so I'd do it if it weren't too much of a price difference.

TravelHacks,"A couple of weeks ago I booked a four-night, end of May stay through [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) at a property in Sorrento, Italy. A few days ago we randomly discovered on the confirmation that our reservation was made for 2024, not 2023 (I have no idea how this is possible lol, I've never had this issue when booking a stay at any place). 

The major problem is that the booking is non-refundable. I messaged the property, apologizing profusely for this mistake and asked whether it would be possible for them to cancel the booking and reimburse us. They said that we have to take up the issue with [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), which we did and today [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) messaged us back, saying they contacted the property to request cancellation, but the ""accommodation is unable to make an exception in this case and you will be charged the entire cancellation fee"". 

I'm probably just dumb as heck and deserve blowing €370 down the drain, but I just don't see what the property has to gain by this? When someone books a stay 15 months in advance, the price is obviously much lower (when I checked the dates for the end of May 2023, the price range is around twice as high and it doesn't look like they have problems with occupancy rates either). If I don't cancel, won't they miss out on a larger sum down the road, or? I'm also confused by the property saying that we paid [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), not them - will the money not transfer from the site to the hotel until in May next year? In the end it's a big sum for us and currently it makes more sense just to write the money off and not go on the trip.

I am spending 3 weeks in Germany during July and very early August, with my final 9 days in Leipzig and Cologne.

I am starting to think 9 days might be too many days for both cities combined.  So, I have been thinking of including either Antwerp OR Ghent in between or at the end of those 9 days.  That said, I am flying from Cologne to Barcelona at night.  So, I gotta come back to Cologne anyways.

It looks like Ghent is a little closer to Cologne time wise by train.  So I was wondering if it would be the cheaper option? Antwerp is a bigger city than Ghent, so I guess Ghent could be cheaper overall for a few days.

I am thinking of the following: 3 days in Leipzig, 3 days in Cologne and 3 days in Antwerp/Ghent and come back to Cologne two or three hours before I fly out of Germany from Cologne.

I don't mind missing out on Ghent/Antwerp entirely but I have been reading comments like ""Cologne is depressing"" ""Cologne is boring"" and ""Cologne is enough for two nights"".  My bank is Australian so the exchange rate will not be great even with my Citibank card lol

After a 14 hr flight, I politely asked if they had rebooking for the same day, they yelled at me and told me no.

TravelHacks,"My mom has asked my help for a travel situation of theirs. I am more attuned to hotel and flight deals than car deals, but I of course said I would see what I can do. 

My mom and dad are traveling to Florida this summer, and they would rather not put the mileage and wear and tear on their vehicle. So, they were wanting to rent a vehicle. But not just ANY vehicle. A Toyota or Honda SUV or Van. 

Those aren't exactly easy to come by at rental locations, so we were looking at possibly renting from a dealership with a car rental department. There are a few issues causing difficulty here. (Aside from the inflexibility on car type and make)

1) They don't live in an urban area, so there aren't multiple rental agencies relatively close. They live in a rural area, and the nearest rental places, even dealerships that rent, are like an hour away. This is inconvenient, for a number of reasons. It adds 2 hours of driving time the morning of their trip. It requires 2 people to drive to and from. 

2) They are leaving on Friday and coming back Saturday night. All the rental agencies/dealerships/etc. will almost certainly be closed. Many of the places, but not all, will be closed Sunday as well. So...it's adding essentially 2-3 days of rental fees (depending on how they charge). Those extra days are killers. Even the one extra day takes things from being over their budget but doable to too far outside their budget. 

3) The budget. Their limit is $350....maybe $400, with all the taxes and fees included. I actually miraculously found something for $415. But, they are not willing to take a chance that it might be a car make that they don't care for. 

I am a big fan of Turo and have used it in the past. It's also nice because you can pick the exact vehicle you want. But...it still has the problem of price being higher than the budget, and there is still the issue of needing to travel a good distance to pick up a vehicle. 

Can anyone give me any recommendations, or should I prepare them that...it's not going to happen.",Car rental thorn in my side....help!,,throwawaylastsupper,,0,2023-03-28 01:58:43

Would strongly prever to experience the Lao section of the LCR, of the Laotian model CR200J train (lol it's finally not the ""trash bin"" painting) as I'm also a entry-level train enthusiast.

Questions:

1. Should I get the visa on arrival (it's allowed) or in advance? And if in advance, should I go to the Laos consulate or use private services?
2. When should I reserve the hotel/hostel rooms? Now, or later, or after I arrive?
3. Food recommendations?
4. Should I learn some basic Lao in advance or can I get by with English (and Japanese/Mandarin/limited German)? And if I should, what is the best way to learn it? I'm using a VPN that may or may not work to access the global internet.
5. It's 40 degrees celcius in Laos. Any tips on how to stay safe in such a climate, like how strict should I employ anti-sunburn measures? I have never travelled to a tropical area in summer.
6. Can I trust private, often illegal ticket scalpers to buy train tickets for the LCR? I'd prefer to travel in Business or First class as I have never experienced a Business class train travel. Second class is also okay anyways.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone!

I am going to Europe for the very first time in my life after so many years of my ""Everybody goes to Europe, I don't want to go"" phase lol. 

My partner is super interested in Hamburg, so we decided to go to Germany first for no more than 2.5-3 weeks, followed by flying/catching the train to Spain (2.5-3 weeks) and then train/bus to Portugal (3 weeks for sure).  I just have no idea if it is cheaper to catch trains and/or buses around Europe compared to flying.  I live in Australia, and the AUD is very weak this year lol.  But I can't go overseas in 2024 or in 2025, so... 

We will be in Europe during the high season (July - September; 72 days).  If it is cheaper to book trains and buses asap, please let me know! The plan is the following:

\- Sydney to Frankfurt with a 17 hrs overnight stop in Seoul (flight booked, accommodation in Hongdae booked).

\- Frankfurt to Hamburg.  We arrive in Frankfurt at 5:40 pm on Sunday 9 July.  Is it best/cheaper/easier to stay the night in Frankfurt and catch the train to Hamburg the next day? Or just catch the train to Hamburg right after we get our bags after customs and etc?

\- Hamburg for \~1 week; Berlin for \~1 week; Leipzig for 4-5 days.  The end.

\- Leipzig to Paris or Central/Southern France or even straight to Basque Country.  I can't seem to find the best way to go to Spain by train or bus from Leipzig.  Unless it is best/cheaper to just fly from Leipzig to Northern Spain?  I don't mind staying in France for a few days.  If so, it seems I would have to stop in Paris, which is not what I planned.  If I can avoid Paris, I am not sure which place would be a good stopover from Leipzig.  I assume Southern France?

\- Spain for 3 weeks.  We would love to start the Spanish part of the trip in Basque Country for 3-5 days (Donostia-San Sebastian and Bilbao), Zaragoza (1 day), Barcelona and small day trips nearby (5-7 days in total), Valencia, Alicante/Almeria, Granada, Cordoba and Sevilla (heard it is super hot in August!) and/or Cadiz.  The end. 

We are Madrid (4-5 days) to the end before we fly to Frankfurt and fly home 8 hrs later.

\- Portugal for 3 weeks.  It looks like it is easy to go from Sevilla/Cadiz to Faro, Portugal by bus.  Flixbus is the cheapest bus company I've found but heard it is quite horrible? We are planning to catch buses and stay in the Algavre region for a whole week (23-29 Aug). Unless that's too long? Aiming at making Faro and Lagos as my two main hubs in the Algavre.  Lisbon and day trips nearby (e.g. Sintra) for a whole week in total.  Coimbra and Porto for a whole week in total.  Are 3 days in Coimbra too long? Read great things about Porto.  The end.

\- Bus/train from Porto to Madrid.  Stay in Madrid for 4-5 days.  

\- 18 Sept in the morning: Fly from Madrid to Frankfurt (flight booked).  Hang around Frankfurt for about 6 hours plus the two hours wait at the airport to come back to Australia.

 I'm usually a fanny pack user but have to hold my water bottle as I take it everywhere. I usually get 1 liter plastic bottles while traveling, and it would be great if the bag could hold that and my phone and a little money. Any recommendations?

TravelHacks,"Hey guys, do any of you have recent experience with the following (or similar) itinerary?

First flight: Vienna - Seoul Incheon, operated by Korean Air

Second flight: Seoul Incheon - Tokyo Narita, operated by Jin Air (Codeshares with Korean Air)

Connecting flight also leaves within the same day.

I've purchased this flight on the website of Korean Air within one ticket, so both flights show up within one e-Ticket.

Because on the e-ticket it stated that the second flight is operated by Jin Air, therefore I should use the check-in counter at Terminal 1 at Incheon airport. Because I wasn't sure, whether I have to re-check my baggage at Seoul and go through Immigration and customs, which also means, that I have to apply for K-ETA, I've called the service hotline of Korean Air regarding my itinerary and they said it shouldn't be a problem, I just have to go to the check-in counter for Korean Air at the departure airport (here Vienna) and my checked in baggages will be delivered to the final destination (Tokyo) without rechecking it in Seoul, therefore meaning I don't have to go through immigration and customs.

I also think that this should be fine, I've checked the site from Jin Air regarding this and found the following:[https://help.jinair.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410892058265-Can-my-baggage-be-connected-for-free-when-transferring-to-another-airline-](https://help.jinair.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410892058265-Can-my-baggage-be-connected-for-free-when-transferring-to-another-airline-)

So therefore, I've decided not to apply for K-ETA, but I'm still a little bit unsure, if everything goes according to plan. Therefore, I've like to ask if any of you have any experience regarding this topic. Especially if a re-check of baggage at airport Incheon is required, and I'm denied boarding because I don't have the K-ETA approval.

In addition from what I've gathered, for my return flight, I would go to the check in counter of Jin Air and it should also deliver my baggage to my final destination (Vienna)?

Should we try to cancel and get a refund, and book directly through an airline, or just go through with it? The trip isn't until three more months from now, and it was paid for last night.

At the time of booking, I had gold status with American thanks to work. So at the time of booking, I was able to choose my seat.

Fast forward 9 months later (today). I check the American app and my flight disappeared. I check the BA site and British Airways canceled my flight. After an hour of being on the phone, BA rebooked my flight but refuses to book me in my original seat next to my wife. They simply state that this is an American Airlines issue and out of their control. 

I call American and they won't speak to me because all agents are busy. I talk to them in the chat and they blame British Airways. In the American application, they are trying to get me to pay $123 for the same seat.

The Portable Fresh Juicer Blender is a game changer for anyone looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle on the go. With its compact and portable design, you can take it with you anywhere, whether it's to the gym, work, or out for the day. Plus, it's waterproof and wireless, making it easy to use and clean.

The 1400mAh battery is impressive and can be charged with a USB cable, allowing you to blend up a quick and healthy snack without having to hunt for an outlet. The blending power is also impressive, making smooth and creamy smoothies and juices with ease. And with the ability to control the texture by blending for longer or shorter periods of time, you can customize your drink to your liking.

The only downside is that it's not very large, so you can only make one serving at a time. However, if you're a single person or don't mind making multiple batches, it's not a big deal.

Overall, the Portable Fresh Juicer Blender is a great buy for anyone looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle while on the go. Its portability, waterproof design, and impressive blending power make.

I exhaustedly drove 8 hours home and returned the car at Pearson….I immediately got asked by Budget how the damage to the car had occurred. There on the driver’s side was a fairly significant dent I hadn’t noticed. I was boggled; I had made exactly 2 10-minute stops en route, parked away from others, and had not caused any damage. 

I was told I should have inspected the car before getting in at the origin. The agent who helped me in Philly did not indicate I should inspect the car; I was too exhausted to even think of it. Is it an expectation that the rental agent should do this?  Given that car rentals are their job and not mine, I feel like I should have been walked to the car and told to sign off that there was no damage. This was absolutely not done.

Son is on a competitive traveling baseball team. Has a tourney in Vegas Easter week. Only husband &amp; son are going this trip. Will need to fly out 5th and will be done early afternoon on the 8th. Flying SW, so bags are free. 

We live less than 15mins to DEN, but COS is about an hours drive each way, so picking them up from there wasn't really an issue. 
Flights home on Sunday to COS were 2-3x cheaper to to DEN. 
Then we saw a flight that has a layover in Denver, then on to COS. I thought, perfect. We'll book the $67 flight home &amp; they can jump off there, at 920pm &amp; then we'll save ourselves the drive. They are only going for 3nights &amp; can easily pack a carry on &amp; back pack for flight home. 
Except....we can't check bats. And my husband is the one who will never ask anyone for help or a favor, even though we are constantly asked &amp; never say no whenever someone needs help, esp to baseball family. 

The thing is, the other 9-10 players will also be flying home that afternoon too. And we will see everyone on Monday, Tuesday for practice. Not really putting anyone out, but again, husband refuses to put himself out there for any sort of help. And these baseball bats are $300-500 each (son will take 2-3). 

Anyone have a hack that I don't know about? How can I get our bags to get off in Denver, if we are supposed to go on to COS? Can you carry on a bat? (I'm pretty sure no, but hey, maybe?)","Getting off at layover, what about bags?",,Emjewels223,,0,2023-03-21 16:15:24

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone!

I'm planning on traveling to Nice with a friend this June. 

I am planning on flying from NYC to Nice on June 1st. I would probably stay for a week and leave around the 8th.

Next, I want to visit family in morocco.  I want to fly into Marrakech on the 8th and stay for a week. I would leave on the 15th, take a train to Rabat to visit family for a few days, and fly back from Rabat back home to NYC.

Now, I am wondering what is the cheapest way I can do this.  I do need checked baggage as well, as I will have things to bring and many things to bring back. I am a bit flexible with the dates if there are cheaper dates to fly. I know this trip won't be the cheapest but, I am trying to go for my cheapest options as I still have Airbnb and other costs to consider. 

I am open to other options besides flights in regard to getting from France to morocco. I also don't travel too often so I am wondering what options besides Airbnb are good for short-term rentals. I am open to any other methods of travel.

TravelHacks,"I rented a room through booking.com while I was traveling for work. It was a place that I had rented a room from 2 times before, very small, minimal, and cheap but all I needed was a bathroom and a bed, which it had. Anyway, I had to rush out the morning of my checkout and forgot a pretty large book of collectible cards (football, basketball, baseball, soccer, YuGiOh, Pokémon, magic the gathering, autographs, etc.) worth about $3000-4000. My son and I forgot to take the book out of the car the day I left. I use my vehicle for work and had to empty out anything that was of value or that I wanted to keep safe from being ruined or broken. 
Later that day I tried to contact the owner of the property through text and phone call with the phone number provided on booking.com. This continued for about 4-5 more days with multiple tries to contact per day. I then started sending direct messages to the owner through the booking.com app, still no response. Next, I contacted booking.com customer service through their app chat. Their (pretty quick) response was that the owner was going to check with the cleaning lady to see if she found anything and get back to customer service with an answer. That was 3 days ago, with a total of about 10-11 days since the day I checked out. 
There’s a camera in the “common” area of the home that points directly at the room I was staying in. So I’m sure there would be video showing someone walking out of the room with a book that’s 12x10 and 6 inches thick full of cards. My question at this point is, what else can I do to get this book back? My son is DEVASTATED and I feel like a horrible father, I CANNOT let him down. 
Thank you in advance to anyone that has ANY advice or recommendations that can help this sad dad make his crushed son feel better.

I'm Mexican-American btw, and I've never really seen snow or seasons.

Recently I've been to Big Bend, TX. (10 hours away lol) My first time in a national park and damn I loveeed it. I especially loved the freezing nights and the stars. I have never seen the desert before so it also wowed me. It's my second time there and I'm just wondering what other national parks would be like.

So finally I have time to take a gap year. I'm thinking if I should do an epic roadtrip in the US, camping, visiting parks and some cities here and there and experience seasons. I have the car already. Or if I should follow the advice of my friends and go to Southeast Asia, which is also the most popular gap year place I believe.

I honestly can't decide. S.E asia feels like a cultural experience, with a new culture, cuisines, and it's also cheap. But US is an outdoor and adventure experience.

TravelHacks,"Hey, 

when i travel i walk a lot and like to explore. The problem i had on my last trip that that blisters began to form on my small toes. They were very painful and it got very hard to walk . I placed bandaid on them and tried to cover them with lots of cotton so it wouldn’t friction with shoes, still did not help. i had to spend the last 3 days of my trip just traveling by car and setting in places that i visited also limping whenever i walked. 

I have upcoming trip and don’t want to suffer again. What is the best way to avoid having blisters? 

FYI i always were sneaker shoes with breathable mesh. my shoes are one of the good brands with memory foam soles. I don’t like tight or fit shoes so  i always buy one size larger. I  change my socks either daily or twice a day and i wash my feet daily. I am overweight so is it weight problem? 

Any advise is appreciated

As the title says, I am in the preliminary stages of planning a bucket list trip for me (65m) and my wife (66f) to Melbourne for the 2024 Australian Open. My problem is my wife is a claustrophobe and cannot spend over about 8 hours in aircraft.

At present I am looking at flying from WAS &gt; (LIS) TLV &gt; (DBI) HKT &gt; MEL &gt; PPT &gt; (LAX) WAS spending some amount of time at each site to enjoy the area and to enable her to recover for the next leg.

Some websites mention even doing two transfers to maximize value, like going from (made up example) Citi Thankyou Points to Avois, to Qatar Privilege Club points, etc ...

I had had a question for those who have transited through DXB before.

I booked 2 different flights with 36 hours between them. One arrives into DXB and the other departs from DXB onto a third destination the next day. 
I will have to collect my bags after arriving via the first flight and for that I will have to pass through immigration first. 
Both flights are entirely different airlines with no codeshare agreement and different PNR. Did this because the fare I was getting for my final destination was super cheap. Also, visa on arrival is NOT offered for my nationality and my flights are not Etihad or Emirates or any other UAE airlines.

Do you think I did the right thing because I am relying on getting the free transit visa to pass through immigration, collect my bags, sleep in a hotel and then depart again the next day? Will immigration create any problems with this?

In a recent blog post, [Sata Travels](https://www.satatravels.com/home) shared their top 10 must-do activities and places to stay for a memorable staycation in Dubai. These recommendations range from relaxing at a beachfront resort to exploring the city's iconic landmarks.

Some of the top activities on the list include taking a ride on the world's fastest roller coaster at Ferrari World, visiting the famous Burj Khalifa observation deck for panoramic views of the city, and experiencing the cultural traditions of the United Arab Emirates at the Dubai Museum.

When it comes to accommodations, Sata Travels suggests checking out some of the city's most luxurious hotels, like the Four Seasons Resort at Jumeirah Beach or the Atlantis, The Palm. But for those on a budget, they also recommend some more affordable options like the Rove Downtown Dubai hotel.

In May I'm planning to visit San Diego and Seattle and rent a car for a couple days for each. When I click the top results on Google, I'm shuttled from site to site and not only does the price change, but I am quoted for 3 or 4 days when I only select 2 (less than 48 hours). 

It's infuriating. What's the best way to do this without overpaying or spending hours combing through all these sites that definitely seem to be colluding anyway? Would Zipcar be worth it? 3 days in San Diego and 2 in Seattle, then flying back to the East Coast. Also Chicago before San Diego but plan to use public transportation there.

TravelHacks,"Just a reminder that if you buy a ticket through Priceline and the airline cancels the ticket, Priceline cannot and will not guarantee that you will get home without having to buy a new ticket, they are incapable of working with the airline to get the tickets that were sold through Priceline honored, and they allow the airlines to refund only a small fraction of the actual cost of the cancelled ticket. I had tickets from Zagreb  to Seattle on Priceline last July. Lufthansa cancelled the flight because they chose to sell tickets that they did not have the staff to fly. My travel insurance wouldn't pay, because Lufthansa was contractually obligated to get me home. Unfortunately, I had to work with Priceline to rebook - and even though Lufthansa was obligated to rebook, Priceline dropped the ball. I got a refund that was one third of what it cost me to get home (both because the refund did not reflect the higher cost of cities on my return leg and because I was having to buy a last minute ticket). It took me seven months to get an answer from Priceline - which came down to, you are stupid idiot for buying a ticket from us because how could you possibly think we would get you home (paraphrased, but basically their answer was that they were under no obligation to get me home, and refunding a small fraction of the ticket is all that I could expect.) 

Here is the response to stranding me on another continent:  

Upon investigating your case, I can confirm that  there was an involuntary cancellation for the inbound portion of the  flight. To our regret an alternative option could not be offered by the  airline so in such cases we can only raise a refund request for the  unused ticket. 

Allow me to underline that  whenever a flight is canceled, we will endeavor to rebook you on to the  next available flight in the same cabin, but it is always in the matter  of availability. In case the customer was inconveniently assisted, we  want to take the opportunity and apologise for the frustration created.

Thus, we placed a request for a partial refund instead. In response to the query, assistance was provided by the service team. ",Avoid Priceline for airline tickets if you want to get home,,Zhenja92,,0,2023-03-16 02:21:10

What’s the best way to sit together? I know advance seat selection requires a fee, but does that allow you to pick specific seats, or just a “type of seat,” such as window or aisle (which renders that feature useless to us if we get our preferred seat type but far away from each other). 

Will we have better luck if we just wait to check in and pick seats 23 hours in advance?

so i plan on taking just a carry on and a personal item. both bags fit fine for dimensions. one should fit fine under the seat and the other above me. but they're a few pounds over weight. from what I've seen just googling, it seems that airlines don't bother weighing those bags if they look like they'll fit fine. can anyone confirm that's a safe bet? i havent flown in a few years and i don't remember any issues back then. 

follow up question - my Nintendo switch won't fit in those two bags. it's not the end of the world if i can't bring it, but if i just carry my switch case in my hand separately would they care either? like it's a hand held item not part of my bags?

This is something which they list every year.  Keeping that this list in mind, I've gone &amp; expanded upon as to why  its so.

Hopefully this helps any  new solo travelers who are reluctant or afraid to start their journey,  these places would be a good start.

No country is 100% safe.

Keep  in mind, this list doesn’t guarantee your safety as an individual  traveler, your safety is in your hands. Use your judgement, use common  sense, be practical, be informed.

1. If I don't have any car insurance, do I need to buy some sort of rental car insurance from Enterprise? If so, what is the minimum required thing to buy, as they have so many options, such as Damage Waiver, Personal Effects Coverage, and Supplemental Liability Protection ([https://www.enterprise.com/en/help/faqs/car-rental-insurance-us.html](https://www.enterprise.com/en/help/faqs/car-rental-insurance-us.html))

So my mom and I recently applied for and received our passports for our upcoming international trip in September this year. My passport is fine, but my mom received hers with her middle name misspelled. Our plane tickets do not include our middle names, but licenses and Real ID (once we get it next month) will. I was wondering if there is a fee to get this fixed or if it's worth it to ""risk"" going with the misspelling (which I would rather not do due to anxiety in this being my first out of country trip).

TravelHacks,"Having recently traveled to hotels in south east Asia, and in Europe, where they require you to keep a hotel key card in a power slot to have electricity and air conditioning in the room, I have a little hack to share, if you have more than one room. So you need a minimum of 2 rooms for this hack. It was frustrating to not have power to charge a battery pack while we were not in the room since we had to take the room key. What we found out at almost every single hotel we stayed at, was that the key is universal for the power slot. We had 2 rooms so we would take room key #401 and put it in my room which was room #200. I would then take my #200 room key with me and we would go about our day. So in essence, 1 of the rooms now had power vs none of the rooms having power if we all took our key card with us. When we would return to the hotel, we would go to my room first, since it was the the lower level with the key. We will swap out the keys, and my friend would go up to his room with his key.",Hotels that require a keycard for power haxk,,smiledrs,,0,2023-03-14 10:14:26

TravelHacks,"I made a huge mistake booking a hotel for an upcoming trip to Tokyo with my two kids. I made a reservation on [booking.com](https://booking.com) for a total of about $3000 for 6 nights in a large chain hotel, which is more than I could afford, but our dates are in high season and almost everything was sold out when I started looking in January. The hotel offered free cancellation until March 3, so I felt safe in having a backup while I looked for something cheaper. Soon after I did find something cheaper, less than $1500 for the same 6 nights, in the same hotel in the same type of room, but on a different travel website. That also offered free cancellation, so I went ahead and booked it. 

Here comes my grave mistake: my son got covid and then I caught it from him and we were both sick and I forgot to cancel the first reservation during the free cancellation period. Today I went on [booking.com](https://booking.com) to do so, and was informed that the cancellation fee is the full price of the trip, i.e. $3000. I asked for them to waive the fee, thinking that it's 3 weeks out, and it's high season so they'll have no problem rebooking the room. They said no. I have the option to cancel the reservation and be charged the entire fee, or to keep the reservation.

I am a single mom who saved up and pinched pennies to be able to take my kids on this trip that we have all dreamed of, so it's not like I can say ""Oh well, I'll cancel the second reservation and just pay an extra $1400 for the exact same room booked on the first reservation."" 

The way I see it, I have two options to try to avoid paying for the more expensive reservation:

1. I cancel the credit card I used for the [booking.com](https://booking.com) reservation, and then cancel the booking and ignore it when they ask for a new card after the charge is declined. Then I show up at the same hotel on the same reservation date and try to check in under the other booking, hoping they haven't made the connection to the failed cancellation.
2. I don't cancel the first booking and just show up at the hotel and try to check in under the second booking, that is already paid for BTW. But will they see two bookings and not allow me to do this, and they will force me to pay for both rooms, or cancel the second booking and keep the money?

I feel angry at myself for not reading the small print when I booked the ""free cancellation/pay when you arrive at the hotel"" room on [booking.com](https://booking.com). I don't travel much and I had absolutely no idea that a hotel would charge me for the full stay when a room is canceled so far in advance. (And, for reasons I cannot understand, the hotel's cancellation policy on the second travel website is a fee of 1 night's charge!) I'm in such a bind now, and I'm going to be losing a lot of sleep over this unless I find a solution.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone, hoping to get some tips and suggestions from folks who’ve traveled this area before as I’m in very early stages of sketching out an itinerary. My partner and I have booked round-trip flights to Paris in late September (I know open jaw would have been better, but this was cheap and it’s already booked). I’m thinking of traveling by train from Paris to Venice, stopping in a few regions along the way, and then flying back to Paris (or the other way around). 


Our wishlist of destinations is too long to fit into two weeks, so opinions on what is a must-do and what is skippable are helpful! Here’s what I’ve got so far:

-A couple days in Paris at the start and end of the trip (total 3-4 days)

-A wine region in France, hopefully involving a vineyard tour and tastings. Open to suggestions, but my partner strongly prefers red wines so I’m thinking a couple days in Dijon (but also looking at Lyon)

-A quick stop in Geneva, since it’s right there anyway (1-2 days?)

-A few days along the coast somewhere. Any suggestions there?? I’m open to anywhere from French Riviera to Cinque Terre

-A few days in the Alps/Dolomites where we can take in the scenery and do some day or half-day hiking. Open to France, Italy, or Switzerland here. Is this achievable without renting a car?

-Lake Como, perhaps? Would that fit into the mountain category above, or is this a separate stop?

-Spend a day or two in Venice before flying back to Paris from there. Feel like we should see it before it’s gone, considering climate change.


Obviously this adds up to more than the 14 days we have on the trip, so some cuts need to be made somewhere. I’d also love some tips on which cities are easily connected by train.

I sent 3 follow up emails, and the last two bounced back as the email address no longer exists. They never intended on giving me back my own money, but were happy to waste hours of my time while I combed through bank statements and confirmation emails to provide them with every piece of evidence needed to show that they owed me $240. When they had every piece of info, they deleted the email address. What was the point? If you're thinking about booking a holiday, don't be charmed by their lower prices.

TravelHacks,"I learned a lot from my experience being involuntarily bumped from a flight today. Thought I would share so others can be prepared in similar circumstances. My husband and I suspected that we were going to be bumped when we weren’t issued a seat number during online check-in. So tip #1 to avoid any chance of being bumped is MAKE SURE YOU ARE ASSIGNED A SEAT at check-in. If you aren’t assigned a seat or are interested in the freebies that comes with voluntary or involuntary bumping, read ahead.


Voluntary Bumping:

Tips for Volunteer Bumping:
1. Don’t just accept the first or second auction offer you hear over the loudspeaker.  The first reason is that they’re going to try to lowball their offer to see if anyone takes the bait. The airline is trying to find the cheapest way to fix the situation (the situation being that they oversold the flight). They’ll typically start saying something like, “The flight is overbooked today. Any volunteers who come up now will be flown out on the next flight and receive a $500 travel voucher.” 

The second reason is because this process WILL cost you a lot of time, and don’t forget to include that time in your mental calculations. Even if a $500 travel voucher and free hotel stay and meal vouchers sounds appealing, remember that you’ll spend longer at the airport dealing with the situation and you’ll probably have to wait for your hotel room to be cleaned before you can check-in, so if you took an early flight you might not be able to fully relax for hours. 

2. Understand that it is, in fact, a negotiation. You can ask for a higher travel voucher, cash offer, more meal vouchers—really whatever you want in the voluntary phase. The worst that can happen is they say no and wait for a different volunteer—and you still make it to your desired destination on time.

3. Be wary of the travel vouchers and ask lots of questions. The vouchers can be notoriously difficult to cash in. Make sure you confirm it will be good for both weekends and blackout dates. Also, if you book another trip just to use it before it expires, you’re likely spending more than you made by volunteering. That’s why my husband and I were in full agreement that if we were involuntarily bumped (which we were), we wanted cash instead of a voucher.

4. Most importantly - especially if you are traveling during a popular holiday - make sure they GUARANTEE you’ll be seated on the next flight and don’t leave until your seat number has been issued. We met one poor soul who agreed to fly standby in her voluntary negotiations, but because the destination was a popular one for spring break, every single flight for the past two days had been fully booked and she was still at the airport.

5. Expect the unexpected. When we received our hotel voucher, the airline sent too many passengers to the same hotel. There were no rooms left for a few people in line, and the only advice they were given was to return to the airport and get a different hotel voucher. Needless to say, those folks were understandably quite upset.

6. Meal vouchers are lower than average restaurant prices. We received four meal vouchers for $12 each meant to last us two days. Not terrible, but also not the amount I was expecting.



Tips for Involuntary Bumping:
1. Know the law - both its pros and cons. 

Pros: you can get cash instead of a travel voucher. You are entitled to 400% of the ticket price or $1550, whichever is LOWER. 

Cons: The cash may be all you get, meaning the airline may not be able to get you on a future flight if it is a particularly popular destination. Luckily for us, we were very polite and understanding with our ticket agent so she worked hard to get us a flight two days later — but the law does technically absolve the airline of its rebooking responsibility. 

2. Expect to have to advocate for yourself. The airline will still try to push a travel voucher on “invols “ instead of cash, so you have to make it clear that you know what you are entitled to.

3. Cash takes longer to get than a travel voucher. Once we asked for cash, we had to walk to a different part of the terminal and wait in a rebooking line until a supervisor could give us debit cards. It added another hour of waiting in lines.

4. If you notice no one accepting the voluntary bumping offers and suspect that you will be involuntarily bumped, go up to the counter ASAP to begin the conversation. Your bargaining power is at its highest before the flight closes. You may find the travel voucher amount more appealing than the 400% value of your ticket if, say, it’s a cheap connecting flight that you’re missing.

Hope this helps some folks out there in similar circumstances.",Flight Bump Tips,,GratefulTeacher25,,0,2023-03-11 22:06:40

TravelHacks,"Hello travelers of Reddit!
I'm traveling across several cities in April and May. I’d like to have a consistent checklist of things that will help me explore each of the different cities. So far it’s things like: drink their famous drink, use 3 modes of transportation, eat their famous food, find a mural/sculpture/public art, visit their tallest building, attend a live event. 
I kinda think these ideas are a lil boring though. What creative, fun and more whimsical kind of ideas might you all have? If you’ve made a checklist for your own multi city travels, what were your favorite things on the list? 

Other things I’m curious about:
Any good travel mantras, mottoes etc? What phrases or affirmations do any of you use while traveling to help you remember to embrace the chaos, smell the roses etc?

What kinds of routines do you use while the landscape and people around you are changing but you’re a creature of comfort who is pushing themself via travel? 

What is a small, lightweight, reasonable, cute, quirky thing to look for in each city to bring back as a souvenir? Some ppl collect shot glasses or magnets from their travels and that’s just not me. 

A few details if its helpful: I’ll be solo traveling in the north east in VT and PA, then in the south, AL and LA and I’m traveling to each city by train.

This works out because I'm more interested in active travels like hiking, and I've been looking at getting into cycling as well.

I came across The Natural Adventure and Mac's Adventure and like their business style. Solo travel is possible over varying lengths of time. It's also possible to get it stripped down so you're getting a room and a rented bike for a week and almost nothing more, so there's a lot of independence possible at a low price point. A lot of the trips I'm seeing with those two companies are less than $1000 USD, which I'd consider a sweet spot financially. 

I like the look of both of those companies and I'm interested in some tips about other, similar companies that have offerings around that same price point. Additionally, any tips on renting a bike in one location and returning in another - are there any regional, national, or international bike carriers that operate similarly to a rental car company where you could pick up in one city and return in another at the end of your trip (say, pick up in Bordeaux, return in Toulouse).

I have been told that my butt is slightly larger than average or that it is bigger than average (my ex boyfriend said I had a big one.) I’m black pics in comments 

I have grown up in a city that is 42% white 31% Asian, and have always lived here. My ex boyfriend in junior year was black and average looking, overweight. The relationship failed.

I am technically introverted. I intend to start at community college and don’t know what I’ll major in. I will admit to dealing w internalized racism and that I am indeed most likely a colorist. I have enjoyed watching after black kids the most (I babysat, without prompt, my cousins who I met for the first time on our family vacation to Michigan in summer 2021, and really enjoyed working w the kids - specifically the little black kids - on my last day as an intern at a camp in summer 2022. My youngest cousin was a boy who was about to turn 3.) 3 out of 4 people voted “child development” on my poll where I asked what major will likely work best for me, a few days ago (I asked what you think will work best if you’ve spent time around me.)

I am from a low income family. We live in an apartment complex. My older brother is in rehab, and I feel some guilt over how he’s turned out. I have learned this year that I really like reading (I recently finished “IT” by Stephen King and actually have a post about that over on r/books - by recently, I mean a few hours ago.)

I am more involved in my EC’s this year, which the facilitator of an extracurricular I’m in actually pointed out today. I don’t know what I think I’ll actually major in.

I will likely eventually start taking antidepressants. I am attracted to some of the black and white men I see daily.

I asked this on Instagram and there’s one vote for “black” (from an Asian girl) and one for “white” (from a white guy who I called cute like a yr ago.)

TravelHacks,"Hello, 

A friend told me he bought domestic r/t tickets on Frontier airlines (US)online thru their website. Then someone informed them that they can go to the airport and buy the same flights at a cheaper price from their counter.
He did not believe that but then thought of going to airport to try it out.
He was able to buy the same flight tickets for about $80 cheaper each r/t and they were 3 ppl, so saved $250 nearly!!

The person who informed my friend said that he knew someone who stayed near the airport who bought tickets this way always and hence good to try if you stay nearer the airport.

Never knew about this so wondering is this common since this seems to go against the airlines aim to get everyone to purchase tickets from their websites / apps.",Buying flight tickets in airport counter cheaper than online ??,,AbhiAKA,,0,2023-03-10 00:27:22

TravelHacks,"Long story short i'm looking at needing to extend and keep my rental car for 6 weeks. This would be expensive. 

However, some research that Hertz apparently also offers a monthly rental subscription program for $999 per month, insurance included. This would save me a lot of money. The problem is that, for some reason, this program seems to be obscure, not advertised, hard to find, and you also need to be 25. 

I'm 23.75. I've rented three vehicles with Hertz without giving them any problems, I have an AAA card (which apparently is the only reason I was able to rent an SUV under 25? never knew that until some guy asked for my card last time.) 

Additionally, my most recent rental car from Hertz had a major problem. I made a left turn into traffic and the entire passenger side front CV axle, bottom ball-joint, and lower tie-rod came clean off. The car was stuck between two lanes of busy traffic for over an hour, the police were called, I had to pay for a tow that I'm still awaiting reimbursement for, and Hertz had to deliver a new vehicle the next da while I stored their debunk ford edge in my s/o's family's apartment's parking lot, where it wasn't even allowed to be. 

Like, at this point, would it be ridiculous or unfeasible to ask them to do me a solid and allow me to get enrolled in this despite not being 25 yet?",would it be possible for Hertz to make an exception?,,acp3500,,0,2023-03-09 16:33:59

TravelHacks,"I want to move to a state w higher black population that doesn’t have high crime rates 

I’m almost 18. I actually had to turn off IT: Part One (2017) yesterday because I was already feeling sad (I actually read the book and finished it two days ago which is part of why I had plans to rewatch it) but also bc it reminded me of middle school and got me thinking about how different everything is now. I remember that in middle school, I saw IT (2017) twice in theaters - once w my father, the other time w a girl who I don’t hang around anymore. I remember I watched sharp objects after and was rlly into the film and felt to be one of the best horror movies I’d ever seen. But even though I liked it this time (and didn’t finish, but will rewatch Friday) I was still just thinking about how I can’t “relate” to the characters anymore. And comparing it to the novel. 

I’ve changed a lot since the pandemic started. I’m no longer super obsessed w one specific decade. I am also always quite tired and am noticing that a love of reading has replaced my interest in watching films and tv all the time like I did in middle school. I have made a new acquaintance and had my first boyfriend (maybe only one who knows) last yr as a junior

I have been reflecting for maybe the last hour on just… idk, I guess the loss of my youth? Now that I’m getting closer to graduating from high school (I think - I had some drama earlier this school yr like in regards to a few things I actually did a while ago off campus and notice the body language of the staff of my school has changed around me and was wondering if maybe they’ve talked over the idea of potentially holding me back from graduating) I feel kind of anxious. I mean, it feels good, bc a part of me seeks freedom after graduating - the kind of freedom that you obviously don’t have when you’re in school, the freedom to decide on what you hope to do with your life and on how you’ll be spending your time - but I’m also worried abt becoming an adult and just… well, just how my brother is in rehab and how my parents are so unhealthy (and getting older all the time) 

I think I’d like to move, even though I’ve lived in this city for all of my life. It’s a thought that crosses my mind a fair amount. I don’t feel like I “belong” in this city. There aren’t many people who are the same race as me, and it’s safe but I just don’t think it’s the kind of place I want to spend my adult life in. I think I want to eventually start a family, I want to move somewhere that’s less expensive (I know that I’m not typing this in a super formal way.) 

The only people who voted on my latest Instagram poll voted “yes” when I asked if I seem like a bookworm (I posted my book review of “IT” to my account and am really surprised that I have started to enjoy reading as much as I have. It’s just fun, getting lost in the world of a book and learning new terms along the way. Books are actually a lot more entertaining than television.) 

I was bothered earlier today when thinking abt how much things have changed.

The facilitator of an EC I am in pointed out to me today that I am a lot more consistent abt the extracurricular this yr/semester than I was last yr. 

I generally feel kind of nervous when talking to other people but have general anxiety and probably social anxiety too. 

Now that I haven’t been able to replace my silent reading book with another story for my English course (my English teacher had me as third on her list of ppl to talk to for some reason. I remember some part of me was wondering if maybe she was going in order of her favorites or smthn.) I noticed that since I don’t have anything to read, I actually got back into my old love of watching films/tv tonight even though my love of reading has replaced my love of film this month. 

When I graduate, I really don’t want to be stressed out. I want to find smthn that works for me but also doesn’t stress me out

If we are at dinner and the bill comes to $100 and we use our credit card (no foreign transaction fees) will then that convert to $72? or will I still get charged $100?

TravelHacks,"1. **Become A House-Sitter -** If you can manage a few responsibilities, which is looking after someone else’s home (especially pets, plants etc.) while they travel away on vacation or for business. This is a unique way to travel as it features free accommodation, while feeling like a local, plus a lot of more benefits.
2. **Get the foreign money before you leave -** Never exchange money at the airport, too much high rates. Still you see so many people line up to exchange money at airports, even if they promise zero commission, they provide poor exchange value.
3. **Subscribe to hotel newsletters -** Most hotels chains have a newsletter to keep their customers engaged &amp; periodically offer out various types of discounts or offers to entice customers. This is different from signing up / subscribing for your OTA. With a little luck &amp; monitoring periodically, you should come across on an offer that is lower than that of what is being offered online.
4. **Use Less Popular Booking Sites -** The same flight, hotel, place, will cost different different websites. Especially on less popular websites. Try to take advantage of them.
5. **City travel card** \- A humble city travel card can give you access to local transport services, discounts on train, subway tickets to museum fees. Some even offer more added benefits like events, exhibitions, shopping, if you do some research.
6. **8-Week Rule For Flights** \- Studies have suggested that a 6-8 week window before a trip is when the tickets are at the lowest. This is where a big chunk of your money goes, besides  accommodation.
7. **Haggle -** shopping in the local markets, Ask the nearby local person for help, for what an appropriate price is supposed. Maintain a fun, easy going attitude. If the shopkeeper takes a personal liking for you, you’ll definitely get your price.

I’m interested to know which one’s have you tried so far.

TravelHacks,"Hi guys, I was wondering how you would go about booking travel package deals when you travel with kids.  I see a lot of pretty decent deals for traveling to various places in Europe where it’s like $799 for 7 nights in two cities in Spain or something.

Considering that most flights are $400-800, these deals are pretty good.  The rates are usually for two adults and they give you the option to extend the trip.  How would you go about booking these deals if you are traveling with kids?  Would you just call the company to customize the trip and add the flight portion for the kids?  

I’m kind of curious to see how this works because sometimes they are able to get prices down from government subsidies and other items they just offer deals through partnerships.

As our family grows flights are now a big portion of our travel expense and lodging isn’t significantly more until the kids are older.

My parents and I are thinking of applying for global entry, we are all mexican citizens but travel to the US anywhere from 2 to 5 times a year so we feel like it is probably worth getting it, however my mom is worried because she was detained while going through customs in IAH around 13 years ago, they were looking for someone with a similar name to my mom, they questioned my mom for about 3 hours, accusing her of traveling to a place she had never been to and tried to get her to confess something she did not even do until they called another officer who reviewed the wanted person's profile a second time and realized the only thing that matched with my mom was her name, everything else including nationality, height, skin color etc was completely different and only then did they let her go, after this we had no problem until 2013 when we were going through customs in LAX and for some reason the officer thought she was traveling alone and tried to sent her for another screening until a flight attendant from our flight heard them and told them she wasn't alone and then in 2018 when another customs officer sent her for an additional interview while going through customs in IAH, they did not ask her anything this time except where she was going to and then let her go.  
We have no clue why this happened again, I assume whoever accused her of being the wanted person did not completely cleared up her profile and sometimes it gets flagged.  
When she went to renew her visa last year the interviewer asked her if she knew another woman by a similar name or if she had used a similar name before (think my mom's name is ""Grace Craig"" and the woman they were looking for is ""Grace Crain"") my mom said no and that was it, the interviewer said okay and approved her visa renewal.  
Would this affect her chances of being approved? What happens if she is denied and we get approved? Would it be better to just keep going through customs?",Questions about Global Entry if you have been questioned at a USA airport,,lucinasardothien,,0,2023-03-07 00:37:32

TravelHacks,"Looking for advice to plan a trip to Central Europe.  Either last week of February to third week in March vs last week in October to third week in November.  Countries and cities to visit: Germany (Berlin, Nuremberg, Munich), Poland (Warsaw, Łódź, Krakow), Hungary (Budapest), Austria (Vienna),  Czech (Praha), Slovakia (Bratislava).  I’m open to other cities. Even cutting back others, or maybe extending travel time. 

Transport will be rail trips and comparing city to city ticket prices vs Eurailpass.  I know there are pros and cons. Since I’m finally considered a “senior”, there are discounts on rail passes. Looking at three star hotels vs AirBnB vs pensions. I’ve found out youth hostels charge more for a single private room than a three star hotel. 

Main reason for travel, well, I’m finally retiring and am a total history nerd. Focus is on WWI and WWII and Jewish memorial sites. Yes, I know many WWI sites are found in Western Europe, and I’ve seen some on previous trips.  

Home airport is PIT. Is it a bad idea to take the BA direct flight PIT-LHR, and then just Eurostar it to AMS and then rail to Germany, or better to fly into FRA from JFK/EWR/IAD?  There are night sleeper trains from AMS to Berlin.

TravelHacks,"Every time i've rented a car I've always purchased the Allianz added coverage at the end of the booking (I book through carrentalsavers) because it's much cheaper than the agency's LDW insurance and seems to cover everything. 

This time though, I landed in a snowstorm, and the guy at the counter said something about that third party insurance not being valid in this country or something. I honestly don't remember what exactly he said, but in the moment having to make a split-second decision with a fuck ton of snow on the road, I decided it was worth it to risk getting scammed. He also mentioned that two cars he'd rented that day had been in accidents had been returned, which also seems kind of salesman like now that I think about it in retrospect. 

The rental location was at the Montreal airport in Quebec. Does anyone know if that's true at all, or if the LDW insurance was legitimately needed? And if so, how can I cancel my allianz insurance policy?

On a side note, later this same day I was making a routine left turn in this 2022 ford edge platinum and the passenger side CV axle, bottom ball joint, and tie-rod all came straight out. We were stuck in the middle of the road for an hour, I had to pay for a tow, and Hertz delivered a replacement the next day thankfully.

TravelHacks,"Hey everybody, my fiancé and I are in one of the most bizarre travel situations of our lives and are hoping to see if anyone has ever dealt with this and/or might have advice on what to do!

Our original flight was from Boston to Detroit (3/4) with a final destination of Tokyo. We entered our passport info into the delta website and checked in, had the boarding passes in had. Due to weather in Boston we had to change our itinerary and fly through Atlanta.

Here is where everything gets a bit weird. I go to check us in but am being blocked with a message that we now need to check in at the airport - no biggie, happens from time to time. We show up and learn that our passports were reported stolen?!?! Delta could not check us in as our passports (that were in hand, along with other ID info) are of course no longer valid.

WTF! Our only option was to change the flight again to depart 3/7 evening with the hopes of getting an appointment tomorrow and a same day passport, which seems bleak.

Has anyone ever heard of something like this? Any advise?",Major passport issue,,typicalmillenial7,,0,2023-03-05 16:15:20

TravelHacks,"Hey fellow Redditors!

I recently came back from an epic backpacking trip around Asia, and let me tell you, it was incredible! The food, the culture, the scenery - it was all amazing. But there was one thing that kept bugging me throughout my travels: internet censorship.

Whether it was trying to access my favorite streaming services or staying in touch with my friends and family back home, it seemed like every country had its own set of online restrictions. That's when I decided to try out a VPN - and it was a game-changer.

If you're a fellow traveler, or even just someone who cares about online privacy and security, here are five reasons why you need a VPN in your life:

1. Access Your Favorite Websites Anywhere: With a VPN, you can bypass internet censorship and access any website or service you want, no matter where you are. Whether you're trying to watch Netflix in a country where it's blocked or accessing a social media platform that's banned, a VPN will get you there.
2. Stay Safe on Public Wi-Fi: We've all been there - you're at a coffee shop or airport, and the only available Wi-Fi network is unsecured. With a VPN, you can encrypt your internet connection and protect yourself from hackers and other online threats.
3. Get Better Deals on Flights and Hotels: Did you know that some airlines and hotels offer different prices based on your location? By using a VPN to change your location, you can find better deals and save money on your travels.
4. Avoid Geo-Restrictions: Certain content, like TV shows and movies, are only available in certain regions. With a VPN, you can change your virtual location and access that content no matter where you are in the world.
5. Protect Your Privacy: Finally, using a VPN is a great way to protect your online privacy. By masking your online activity and location, you can avoid targeted ads and other invasive practices that compromise your privacy.

So there you have it - five great reasons to start using a VPN today. Trust me, it'll make your travels (and online life in general) so much easier and more secure. I found this [**Community Website**](https://www.vpngrades.com) on Reddit with that latest discount codes from different providers.

My flight from Portland Oregon lands at CDG in Paris at about 10:45am. My next flight through a different airline that I bought as a separate ticket leaves at 7pm.  

I get my checked bag and pay for my checked bag and carry on to be in luggage storage for 6 hours.  
I take the metro into the heart of Paris where I then go to the Eiffel Tower for a summit tour with elevator access. I haven't bought the tour ticket yet, but I'm thinking a 1pm or 130pm time. Would 1230pm be pushing it?  
Well, I do the tour for 3 hours max. I know I'll have to wait at some point for the elevator but it will just be me so I'll squeeze in if I have to.  
  
  
I leave and head to CDG by 4pm. I've read that it takes about an hour on the metro. I'm not paying extra for taxis/Uber.  
If I get my bags at say 5pm, would I make it to board my 7pm flight?  
Is luggage storage before or after the point where I would check my bag?  
Since my night flight is an independent ticket, I'll have to go through the gate agents and such again, I'm sure. Will 2 hours be enough? My night flight is from Paris to Djerba Island, Tunisia.

Context: my partner and I want to take a two week trip to Europe in the fall, somewhere in the mid-September to mid-October range.

Our destination preferences are pretty broad since he’s never been to Europe before (other than not wanting to be cold), but top of our list are Spain, Italy, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, or France. 

I’m seeing direct RT flights to Milan on Neos (which I’m not familiar with) for just under $500 right now, although we’d have to only bring carry-ons and leave on a Sunday instead of Saturday, giving us one less day of vacation. 

Would you jump on these flights, or give it another month or two and see what deals pop up?

On one hand, I feel like there’s good odds that a deal will pop up. On the other hand, I don’t like having nothing to plan/look forward to, and I worry that prices will explode and we won’t end up going (the fall travel dates are already a budget concession, as the original idea was to travel for my milestone bday in July, so I really don’t want to push it further).",Book okay flights now or wait for a great deal?,,RagingClitGasm,,0,2023-03-02 22:39:23

Target: \~500

Gas: &lt;100

Dining: \~400 (grad student living with gf, so a lot of that is chickfila, but some nice sit down restaurants)

I fly once or twice per year, I'm hoping to fly more once I'm more settled into my career. I'm a grad student in Orlando, so a lot of my vacations only involve booking a hotel around the resorts, not flying. But it doesn't seem like many travel rewards cards, Chase/Cap1, offer much for hotels and focus much more on flights. (Im looking at Chase Preferred because I have great credit, but not enough history)

So Im wondering, should I just get a Chase Preferred, and deal with their hotel rewards, or should I get a separate Hotel Credit Card (I havent done too much research on them tbh) and use that soley for hotels, while Chase is for flights/dining/other travel stuff?

However, when i look at booking Just a hotel, not through a package, its $3200?

Why and How are the packages so cheap when they include flights? 

And when booking a room at this hotel through a package, rooms with less features are more expensive? the room i’ve chosen, which is $0 extra, comes with free breakfast and lunch, hotel shuttle, wifi etc, however a room that costs $475 more doesn’t even include a hotel shuttle and Only has dinner for 2 each night?

These people are either refugees or people who have been discarded in the system and they hang around these locations intending to ask for help but they're running along corner some sort of!

**Translation:

I travel to some countries that have very low visa requirements (i.e. no visa required or they have easy entry  for countries with a large outward bound population or an official refugee program via UNHCR). This is not a hack but I'm warning you of an issue. These countries tend to have more issues with people hanging around hotels and shopping malls trying to con or scam you. It's particularly bad in one country that starts with a capital M. These people are either refugees (Syrian, Rohingya and possibly Russian now seems common) or people who have been discarded in the system (but not bums - legitimate travelers I think who overstay because they can't or don't want to return home due to conflict) and they hang around these locations intending to ask for help I think.

More context: on multiple occasions in the XXX hotel at the actual fucking lobby in XXX I've been confront by small families or single guys on a scam of some sort.  It starts simple ""Oh where is the shopping mall?"" and then rapidly segue into highly personal questions and eventually an ask.  I wish the hotels would shut this down.  I have COMPLETE sympathy for these people as the UNHCR or the countries immigration dept is completely broken and these people are allowed into M and T but given no real support and end up basically begging.    These people are not economic refugees or illegal workers - they're allowed in but often not permitted to engage in official work.

It's all a bit muddy and I'm really not being racist - my rant really is with the system and the conflicts that drive these people out their homes.  As a traveller keep this in mind when traveling to countries with low barriers of entry if you cannot deal with this (I can, but my mother can't). I think there are two countries starting with M that are particularly overloaded with refugees due to easy entry now.**

TravelHacks,"Hey all,

We recently got back home from Florida via Air Canada. Our flight (which cost $500 per person, by the way), was supposed to land in YYZ at 8pm. We intentionally paid extra for the straight flight as we were traveling with our 22 month old son.  

The flight got delayed twice, and a third time after boarding. The pilot flat out explained they were having staffing issues, fueling issues and technical difficulties from a previous flight. 

We ended up with a 6.5 hour delay. Landed in YYZ at 2:11am. 

It gets worse...

We wait by baggage claim for 45 minutes until we hear on the PA system that all FLL to YYZ baggage has been unloaded. Our luggage was nowhere to be found, along with about 100 other passengers baggage. 

It's now 3 am and we're told to line up at AC customer service to get a lost baggage form. Another 1 hour wait. 

We finally left the airport at 4:45 am (park n fly didn't show up for almost an hour). 


Is there any way we can get compensated for this disaster? A partial refund perhaps? We still don't know where our suitcase is.

Now, I have read many stories from people online where they have met crazy, disrespectful, creepy or shady people when living in a dorm room like that. Of course, it's not all bad with some connecting and eventually becoming great friends. And also, I would like to mention that I'm not going to simply label anyone and everyone as hostile or with ill intentions. I merely want to exercise caution because after all, I'm going to be sleeping with a bunch of strangers and my personal belongings are just within reach.

We are only really concerned about outbound jet lag and are not too bothered by how we feel on our return. This particular journey has approx 32 hrs travel time give or take. Longer than our usual travel time, with 2 stops instead of one (Auckland to Dublin via Melbourne and Abu Dhabi) 

Usually we stay awake once we hit Dublin, eat, drink copious amounts of tea and walk outside plenty. Falling into bed (nearly dead) at about 8pm. The issue is we always wake in the night and then are up at 5am every day of our holiday barely making it until 9pm before we flake. This specific flight has us arriving into Dublin at 8am which presents additional challenges...

Do we take a nap on arrival or will that make it worse? What can we do prior to leaving that'll make it easier to adjust? Have you got any tried and true techniques for tackling heavy duty jet lag?

TravelHacks,"Okay, so looking for reasonably priced destinations. Ideally it’s somewhere scenic that feels upscale/luxury, but is moderately priced. We don’t see a traditional wedding in store for us. Instead our vision is a trip with friends and family.

A location with hotels that have luxury/upscale vibes for around $200 or less per night OR for ~$350/night but there are decent hotels for under $200 too.
Example: Dubrovnik, Croatia with beautiful views and you can stay at a beautiful hotel like the Rixos for ~$145/night.

Ideal features:

• Scenic/Picturesque: landscape or architecture 

• Weather: moderate to warm weather destination. Sunny.

• Near the ocean - this is a plus, but certainly not a requirement.

• Good food 

• Good nightlife or culture that knows how to celebrate(like Argentina or Mexico)

• Location: North/South/Central America or Europe

• Convenience: a plus if it’s near a major airport, but I don’t want to limit ideas. Onsite activities or nearby things to do (a city or plenty of excursions).

I plan to do Singapore for few days, then Thailand, then Hong Kong, Vietnam (Hanoi/ Ha Long Bay) and finally come back to take my flight in Singapore.

I wanted to do Japan instead of Vietnam, but it would means that I need to do a 7H flight the day before 2 long flights to go back to SFO.

TravelHacks," I have been travelling for years as a minimalist traveler and my life fits in a 24L bag.  
Over the years I have learned plenty of tips, tricks and hacks and here are just a few. I always love sharing, so if you have any questions or would like to learn more about minimalist travel please feel free to ask.  
I'm really passionate about seeing the world and experiencing what this planet has to offer in terms of communities, food and culture. But more importantly, I love hearing people's stories and experiences.

Either way here are the tips, Hope they help :)  


1. Get a backpack with a harness system to take the weight off your shoulders
2. Get a waterproof bag to protect it from the weather.
3. Bring a power bank to keep your smartphones/digitals charged when you’re on the go
4. Pack Black – One pair of black jeans, 3 black T’s will get you through a long trip.
5. Find a pair of workout shoes which can also be casual walking and touring attire.
6. You can get by on “Five of Each” (5 pairs socks, 5 undershirts, 5 underwear etc) almost in definitively.
7. Once every 3 months, take EVERYTHING out of your bag. Challenge everything. When was the last time you touched it or used it on a trip? Throw it away or leave it at home if you will not need it overseas.
8. Wear the thicker jeans and the heavier jacket along with the bulkier shoes in the flight!
9. Pack for the right season
10. You can find cheaper, yet comfortable accommodations for your travels. Look for [hostels ](https://hostelworld.com/)or budget-friendly guesthouses which you can find on [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/).
11. Knowing a few basics about the language, culture or traditions of the place you are visiting will make it easier for you to navigate and interact with locals.

Hope it helps and if you would like some more tips you can check out the link below. Either way If you have any questions let me know :)

I have a flight with Delta, and have just purchased a carry-on, no checked luggage.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to buy a better bag than the old duffel bag I use now for travel.  So I'm looking at the Small or Large variations of the [Baboon to the Moon Go-Bag](https://baboontothemoon.com/products/go-bag-small-duffle).

The small bag dimensions: H 10.5in x W 20.5in x D 12.5in

Big Bag dimensions: H 12.5in x W 21.5in x D 14in

Delta said the requirements are 45 linear inches. The big bag dimensions come to 48 linear inches.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you think I can get by with the big bag as a carry on or will they make me check it? If I get by with it on this trip, could I do it with other airlines or are others more strict?**

Fairly new to traveling, so I welcome any help.

TravelHacks,"Hey all,

I have a trip from the US to Europe coming in October and I have -- and I cannot emphasize this enough -- no clue about how to go about grabbing a point card and using it for tickets. Specifically, it looks like all of the great travel points credit cards will give you the sign-up bonus after you hit $X in the first Y months -- which yield my main question...

Do they give you the points immediately at hitting that limit, so you can apply them to flights right away? (or however long it takes you to spend that money)

I'm just generally also totally unclear about how you use points on purchases that are travel-related but I am sure that depends on the card provider.

Many of you may know about this already but I’ll add it for those that don’t. If your flight gets cancelled and you don’t want to wait you can grab a rental car to drive to your destination if it’s within a reasonable distance. However if all or most of the flights are canceled you’re not going to be able to rent a car to drive there because 5000 other people have beat you to the punch. Tell the rental car company that it’s for in town use and you’ll be returning it there. They still have cars but they’re worried about inventory abd don’t want to keep as many as possible. Drive your car to your destination and tell them you changed your mind. It’s a lot cheaper than getting a room (if you can find one) and a lot more pleasant than sleeping in a crowded airport. Not to mention you get there a day earlier. 

I know this is a specific circumstance but believe me you will be so happy it’s an option if it happens to you.",Massive flight cancellations at an airport made renting a car to drive to your next destination impossible because all the cars are gone?,,TableLegShim,,0,2023-02-24 16:06:08

I watched this [video](https://youtu.be/UkmcDafXNzA) on YouTube from Sadhguru which gives some useful tips on handling jet lag and stress while travelling. He travels very often and shared some tips that are based on the science of yoga. I've gone ahead and summarized the points for you all:

Eating right can reduce travel stress

* When you are especially crossing time zones, consume food substance with very high water content like fruits and fresh vegetables
* Consume as much pure water as possible before, during, and after your journey (try to consume within 24 hours after reaching)
* During this period, avoid intoxicants and stimulants like alcohol and caffeine. Avoid food substance that stay in your stomach bag for more than 3 hours like red meat, complex mixtures of carbohydrates and fats, and deep fried foods. 

Practices to reduce spinal stress (helps greatly with jet lag)

* Once you are in a different time zone, get some sunlight exposure especially with your back facing the sun for a minimum of 20 minutes, 2-3 times a day
* And practice [upa-yoga](https://youtu.be/QjGF2MLdIz8)

These tips can help get rid of jet lag quickly. Do try them and see the difference.

# Pre Booking

* Fly between the largest possible hub airports, more airlines competing == lower fares. Taking a train 3-6 hour once you arrive for $20 is better than a more ‘convenient’ flight for $200 more. This site shows what connected airports are biggest: [https://www.flightconnections.com/](https://www.flightconnections.com/)
* Let flight deals dictate your travel plans, flights are often the most expensive aspect. You  could save over $1k if you travel based on deals instead of wanting to go to specific place at a specific time
* Look at flights way ahead of time but when you’re planning to book, as you do, flights get ‘hotter’, try and wait a day after you concluded your search so prices ‘cool down’
* Use a cheap old android phone in incognito mode to search flights and prices. Searching on a high end MacBook sometimes gets you higher fares, especially when booking directly with airlines
* Statistically the cheapest time to book is 64 days before desired departure
* Don't bring a checked bag for ultimate savings and airport convenience. Also, no lost bag
* Churn a credit card to save $500+ on a flight with travel points. Many credit cards offer a 1 year sign up for free, bonus signup points and include travel insurance
* If flying 10+ hours, deliberately choose a flight with the longest layover possible, bonus if you'd arrive in the stopover country late in the afternoon. You'll be able to get a much better sleep in a hotel in the stopover country, in addition to saving bucket loads on the flight. You can also leverage stopover to ’tick off’ other countries/places you'd otherwise not visit
* Some excellent dates to fly out is on Christmas or New year's days early in the morning. Bonus, try to fly to countries that don't celebrate the same holidays as yours so you get a holiday aligned with your work break but you don't pay through the nose on the place you're going. E.g do easter in China, or Australia Day in New Zealand
* Try to travel when your local state has public holidays, this reduces the leave you need to take. My favourite time is between Easter and Australian Anzac Day because a lot of countries don't have days off for then so they often aren't more expensive AND it's not school holidays, but you also get 3 free days of leave
* December is always expensive to fly. Try to either depart on one of the last days of November or return on one of the first days of January
* If you get all the way through the flight booking process and it tells you prices have increased so “go back and start again”. Give it at least 24 hours before retrying. Sometimes even a week if you can be patient, let prices ‘cool down’
* A lot of marketplaces have people selling flight vouchers and credits, often if you're planning to book at the same time you find a seller and you tell them you'll book immediately they'll discount you more (upto and beyond 30%) where you can also validate the credit works along side them.
* Always check the weather for the month in the place you're planning to book. E.g A tropical island in monsoon season is often worse than not going at all. My biggest tip is travel to places when they're experiencing their best weather
* Find good flights on third party sites, note the dates and airline, wait a day then use the airlines site directly. It's often a few dozen dollars cheaper
* If you're searching for flights on the month “view”, often when you click a departure date you'll see a lot return dates that aren't populated eg ?  
 With only a few good ones, this is to incentivise you to book a specific period that's best for the airline. To take advantage, pick some departure dates close to when you'd like to return and notice the best return flights that actually load. Now pick a better earlier departure date, if the return day you want has changed to a ?  
If you click it anyway and search, you'll find it's the same price.
* If travelling with one other person and you feel like getting a row to yourselves. Book the window and the aisle, the single ‘’between” seats are last to get filled. If someone does take it, it's usually easy to swap them for the window or aisle, if not then one of you gets the floor and the other gets the row of seats, have a nice sleep!
* If you want to visit multiple countries in one big trip, book a return from home to country A, then another return from country A to country B ($). This will save about 30% rather than doing home &gt; A &gt; B &gt; home ($$$). Also you'll get to “taste test” country A. Better still, book home &gt; country A city A, then travel to country A city B and do a return to country B ($$)
* The far right seat at the back center of the plane where it decreases from 4 to 3 has the most space and doesn't cost much extra. You can put your leg way out and it wont get bumped by passers by or the trolley  
   
 

# Flights

* Ensure you're the last on the flight and then go into the bathroom, wait until they tell you to get out and pick whatever seat you want on the plane - everyone should be seated by then
* Wear a pride wrist band on each sleeve to potentially get both arm rests on the flight, works when seated next to men
* Laptops are heavy, when checking in, put it inside the back of your pants under your shirt. Once your bags have been weighed, put it back in your bag. This also works if they weigh at the boarding gate
* Bring an empty water bottle, most airports have filling fountains
* Wear your heaviest clothes on you on the plane, you aren’t weighed
* Airport Chappell's are the quietest place to be, good for a sleep
* Never exchange cash at an airport FX converter. The best place is a bank, second best is an ATM. With ATMs, always decline it to do the fx conversion, your bank will do it for you at a better rate automatically
* If you want to bring a second carry on bag, bring one that's a modest size. At the duty free area, buy the cheapest thing you can like a pack of tim tams and then ask for a duty free bag. Put your second carry on inside it. Most airlines allow a bonus duty free bag in addition to one carry on
* Put a napkin between your phone and your phone case sticking out on one side, put that side in the tray table locking mechanism with the tray up for a simple phone holder
* Alternatively, Use a selfie stick to hold your phone for movies on a flight in a much higher and more ergonomic position, allowing you to better lean back, saving your neck
* Don't watch shows with short episodes or play games with short arcady levels. You'll check the clock everytime you finish one and it'll make time drag on. Watch long movies, play endless games or my favorite: be productive on something that gets you ‘’in the zone” like coding, reading or writing  
 

# Hotels

* Get a hotel with an included buffet, eat like crazy and take as much food away as possible. Also, do this as late into the breakfast period as you can to feel full for as much of the day as you can - don't do this at little hotels, only chains for ethical reasons
* Random hotel lobbies have the cleanest bathrooms - Just act like you booked a room
* Get an inflatable ergonomic pillow, you'll never have neck pain from bad hotel/hostels pillows. Tip: Only inflate it about half way for best softness
* Don't get a universal charger. If you don't travel a lot you'll lose it or lose an important piece of it. I think it's best to get a singular adapter designed for the destination countries plug for each trip and just keep a collection. They are simpler, lighter and often more reliable
* If you have to cancel a hotel reservation but it's not free anymore, ask to rebook it later. Then cancel
* Confirm stay and arrivals times with hotels a few days beforehand, it prevents your room being overbooked and you being stranded. Further, be really nice and ask if you could get a free upgrade

# Backpacking

* Bring two phones. I like to film/take photos with my nicer phone but doing so drains the battery a lot, this leads me to bring a battery bank and cables which is a pain. A second (usually old or cheap) phone can be what you use for maps, texting, travel sim and itinerary so you'll often end the day with both phones on 50% charge. Bonus tip, bring a tiny 10cm USB C-C cable and both phones can charge each other so you don't need a battery bank at all
* Get a passport travel wallet that opens with the fold on the shorter side so you can fit notes and boarding passes without needing to fold them up awkwardly
* Instead of a thick raincoat, bring a ‘’single use’ poncho. You can totally use these dozens of times on a single trip
* If you wear sandals, you don't need to pack any socks
* Merrino wool shirts only need to be washed every 4 days max if you're heavily sweating, less if you’re not. They also dry super fast after a rinse in the sink with soapy water. You could easily do a 2 week trip with 3 shirts and only washing one once
* Add mini carabiners to any loops on the outside of your bag, then you can attach anything that itself has a loop so you don't need to carry it
* Get a foldable water bottle, as it empties it takes up less space. Get a good one otherwise the water will taste awful
* Get a 65w + GaN charger - They’re tiny but a little expensive
* Bring a lightweight thin bag with drawer strings for dirty washing. Keep it seperate from your clean clothes, it’ll take almost no space when empty and they’re less noisy than plastic bags which hostels bunmates will be thankful for
* NoDoz is a capsule caffeine tablet that gives great energy and will dramatically improve your mood when you're tired
* Ear buds take up a lot less space than headphones on a flight and the noise cancelling is usually ‘good enough’
* Work remotely 3 days a week while travelling if you’re allowed. You'll appreciate those 3 “rest days” and become more attuned to the area you’re staying while also planning your busier days closer to when you'll actually do them. You also retain 3/5ths of an income and only use up 2/5th of your annual leave
* If staying in a hostel, cook for everyone! It's fun to get some randoms together to go ingredient shopping, especially if none of you know the language, it becomes a real mission. Then while cooking people will be stoked to socialise with you, they'll be grateful and often return the favour
* Taking photos or videos on a phone that automatically backs up with google photos or iCloud is way better than needing to offload an SD card and manually do it yourself every day off of a camera. Also your phone adds metadata that makes searching for moments easier. Bonus, you can make albums for specific people and after a trip, send it to them so they have all their photos of themselves from you in one place

### Misc.

* If you're planning to take a ride share app to/from the airport. Check it regularly before you actually need to go and track the prices. Likely you'll see it double and halve as demand grows and shrinks. Work out what “cheap” is and once you see it, tap “schedule in advance” for a time you’ll be ready to go
* Keep a digital copy of all your documents, tickets, passport, visas, hotels on your phone in a locally saved folder
* Always have an airtag in each bag you're travelling with
* Download maps of the areas you'll travel in advance. So that even if you don't have a Sim you still get GPS, also sometimes the downloaded map will have a detailed floorpan of the airport
* Download the local language on google translate in advance too
* Hydralyte tablets and gastro stop will make short work of any food poisoning
* Bring some basic colored string to braid friendahip bracelets for people you meet
* If travelling in less developed countries, the biggest source of illness is bad water. Don't consume ice, sliced fruit or meat. Opt for vegan food in hot boiling wateror steamed and or go for reputable chains to avoid getting sick. Sneaky tip, eat places where you see kids and crows lined up, parents usually put a lot of work into ensuring their kids won't get sick so they’ve done the work for you.

I'm about to take the plunge and quit my job to travel and work. I plan to stay in one place for 2-3 months (either Portugal or somewhere in Europe). I was wondering how people found accommodation when just starting out - i.e. affordable but practical.

Hostels even seem pretty expensive for 2-3 month stays. So far I've seen a lot of luxury co-working/DN spaces, but no 'no frills' apartments with good internet which get the job done.

TravelHacks,"Background:  I live up north where we are still getting snow in USA and really want some ""quick"" 3-4 day getaways from the cold weather to somewhere warmer. I like to golf and figured I could bring my clubs and enjoy some 70 degree days down south

Situation: I have been wanting to travel (both domestically and internationally) right before 2020 and have been watching flight prices over the last 3 years. However, I cannot ever for the life of me seem to find cheap flights... I have tried different booking sites, airlines direct, and I always see flights that are 300+ dollars MINIMUM last second (normally its 600+). I was under the impression if an airline can't book the flight those tickets drop in price. Is my understanding of this wrong? Essentially, I am getting an itch at the last second to travel and quite literally want to hop on a plane in the next hour or 2 to head to somewhere warmer. I would rather bank on having a cheap flight since the lodging in the area might be booked out the door for whatever reason. I don't want to be double whammied on this. 

Ask: Is there any sort of site or app out there that can find all cheap flights from my surrounding airports? 

Ask2: If ask 1 is not possible can someone suggest a better way of approaching this? What I'm doing is clearly is not working so open to suggestions.",Possible Strategies For Finding Cheap Local Last Hour Flights,,Whavesz,,0,2023-02-23 19:56:06

TravelHacks,"Hi,

My husband and I are going on a Norwegian cruise that has a stop in Belfast. We paid for an excursion to go to Giant’s Causeway, but we have an extra 5 hours after the excursion before the boat leaves port.

I am planning to surprise my husband with a little plot of land in Ireland near the Causeway for his birthday, which happens right before our trip. I’d like to see if we can secure our own transportation from the Causeway to the plot of land near Ballycastle, then back to the cruise ship terminal. 

Would it be possible to secure such transportation? Is there a way to do this that wouldn’t cost a ridiculous amount of money since it’s about an hour back to the cruise terminal.

TravelHacks,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Our schedules finally matched, so my husband and I plan to vacation in the last weeks of March. We decided to take that honeymoon trip we'd postponed for the previous three years because of all those pandemic restrictions. We chose to take a trip to Thailand, which our friends have raved about, sharing their extraordinary experiences and eagerness to return. 

&amp;#x200B;

While certain about our destination, we had doubts about whether to use a travel agency or go on a solo trip. To be honest, I'm a bit of a coward when it comes to trying new things, and I prefer to minimize any potential risks before doing something. So I'm more inclined to use a travel agency that would take care of everything for us. I'd feel more comfortable with the security and insurance that a travel agency could provide.

&amp;#x200B;

But my husband is the opposite and believes solo travel would be cheaper than buying an agency tour. Besides, it'll offer an opportunity to immerse ourselves in the local culture and have a true adventure. He has even done some research and found affordable options for flat rentals and renting a vehicle on Thailand classifieds. According to him, 2K should cover all our needs for ten days and even allow us to buy souvenirs for our relatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds tempting, and my husband almost convinced me to choose this option. Still, I'd appreciate some feedback and advice from people who went to Thailand on their own. Is there anything we should know about while planning the trip? Any things to watch out for? Any dos and don'ts while dealing with locals? 

 

Also, since I don't want to get in any kind of trouble while being there or offend someone unwillingly, I'd be grateful for any guidance about the country's laws or cultural taboos. 

&amp;#x200B;

TravelHacks,"We are planning on flying out of Sacramento/San Francisco/Oakland (not sure yet) to Nashville in the next few months. I've read many articles on flying with kids, but I'd like real feedback and advice on what it's really like. Particularly, I'm concerned about bringing the car seats (3 of them, each weighing roughly 40lbs), packing enough of everything, and how to carry all said things into the airport. 

It also looks like there are very few flights without a layover, except at horrible hours. If it was just myself, it wouldn't be a big deal waking up at 2AM to be on a 5AM flight, but a 1, 3 and 5 year old wouldn't be too happy about it. 

We've heard horror stories from friends taking flights with short layovers where by the time they get on the next flight, it's full except for their seats, and no one will give up their seat for them to sit with their young kids until they make a fuss about it. I get that if you have window seat, it's hard to give up. But an exhausted family will not leave their 2 year old who's never flown before in a seat with strangers far away from them. And those said strangers would not appreciate the uncontrollable screaming too... I digress.

Should we bite the bullet and wake everyone up in the middle of the night for a straight shot flight? What should we do if we do a layover? Long layover worth it? We have a crawler, so I'm cringing at letting him go all over, but I know he wouldn't be too happy being strapped in a stroller for several hours without being allowed down. Advice? Thoughts?

Questions!
1. Is public transportation reliable/safe/recommended around the country? 
2. What excursions/daytrips do you recommend from each city? We have plitvice lakes national park on the itinerary currently.
3. How many days should we spend at each city? Heard Split should take bulk of the 10 days, with fewer days at Dubrovnik.
4. Any must see places in your experience?
5. Are most places on board with using credit, or is it crucial to have a bunch of cash € with you?

TravelHacks,"Hi! 

I'll be taking an overnight train by myself to Italy from Germany. I will be sleeping in a seat (because that's all I have reserved rip) while travelling with a Kanken backpack. 

What is the best thing I can do to keep my backpack safe while I sleep? 

I'm a bit cautious at the moment because (other than being a young femme travelling by myself): 1) I saw a stranger going through people's suitcases on another train journey and 2) my parents had their backpack stolen at a Spanish airport two days ago. 

I'm also arriving at 6 AM, so what can I do to avoid looking like a tourist? I am not gonna make my friends pick me up from the train station at 6 AM after a night out.

TravelHacks,"Hello guys I'm Chinese and wanna travel to Laos (solo) right after the final exams. This would be my first time travelling abroad. I'm on a moderately tight budget, that's part of the reason why I'm choosing Laos, a relatively safe and cheap country. On the internet I read about Luang Prabang, the Capital, and 4,000 beautiful islands which seemed quite fun. But still a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I stay in a youth hostel or a hotel? I have bipolar disorder 2 so I want a more undisturbed condition (I have to take my meds, sleep early etc) but the socializing opportunities in hostels are also attractive. My English (C1\~C2) and Chinese (native) are good, can also speak Japanese and some German, and wanna learn some Laotian so international communication shouldn't be a problem. Should I stay in a hostel or a budget hotel? Or a hostel with single rooms?
2. I would also like to take the Laos-China Railway. But it seems that online booking is not available for the Laotian section. Any hacks on how to make my railway experience easier?
3. I'm quite left-wing so I don't have much interest in the religious culture there but not offending others is still important. I heard that you should never give or recieve things with your left hand and never touch the head of another person. Any other taboos in Laos that foreigners might often break?
4. What non-religious travel attractions are there besides maybe Vang Vieng and the 4,000 islands? I would like more adventures and interaction with locals and other tourists. 
5. Any advice on how to do more outdoor activities in the Wet Season? Can I still take rafts or camp or do whatever outdoor activity in June or July?
6. About tropical diseases and crimes. Is Laos generally safe for a solo traveller who would like to explore the night life of the vibrant capital, or go to more adventurous places?
7. Finally, any other tips on how to safe money while having fun? My total budget (including getting into the country) is maybe only $1,500 or 10,000 yuan so saving some unnecessary expenses is also a good idea.",Traveling to Laos in June or early July,,TheShoA17,,0,2023-02-20 05:43:51

TravelHacks,"In the past I've used [booking.com](https://booking.com) to find places to stay on vacation and I've learned to make sure to check the ""excluded"" section to get a real idea of how much it's going to actually cost. Typically that section included taxes and in the past 10+ years you started seeing ""resort fees"" included there as well. For the most part it wasn't a problem because, typically, every place had similar fees and it didn't change the price THAT much.

However, I am now finding a lot of places (it appears to be mostly vacation rentals) that list their accommodations at significantly lower prices and then make it up with various different fees. For example, I recently found the following in the ""excluded"" section: ""11 % Tax, 9.99 % Destination fee, US$ 18.65 Tourism fee per night, 19.98 % Property service charge, US$ 205.13 Cleaning fee per stay"". It made a listing which originally came up as $222 come to a total of $592.68... which, btw, you can only find out if you start the booking process and get to the details page where it, somewhat ironically, calls it that price the ""No Surprises! Final price.""

Frankly, I don't have a problem with it being a fairer price, but it makes the ""sort by price"" feature completely useless since ""sort by price"" doesn't use the final price. So, does anyone know of a way to get ""sort by price"" to sort by the actual final price? Maybe by filtering out ""homes and apartments""? But not all ""homes and apartments"" do this, so it would remove a bunch of legitimately priced listings.","Is there any way to sort Booking.com accommodation results by full price including all ""excluded"" fee?",,QatarYouDoing,,0,2023-02-20 03:31:23

There’s no doubt the last few years have been tough. First the pandemic and now perpetual talk of a narrowly avoided recession – it’s enough to make anyone need a break.

Scouring travel websites can also result in a sinking feeling. Flights have gone up (2022 saw the biggest ticket price hike for more than 30 years according to some reports) and car hire has too.

When Which? analysed costs in nine holiday hotspots over the Easter holidays, it found increases of 72 per cent on average. Meanwhile, the company has also reported package prices soaring by 20 per cent or more.

Despite all this, a holiday remains a reason to be cheerful which explains why the British are reluctant to let go of theirs. Bookings are almost back to pre-Covid levels and demand is high.

To that end, our experts have come up with 50 money-saving ideas worth celebrating. There are myriad ways to trim the costs of a trip without losing any of the feel-good factor, whether they involve shaving a star off your hotel’s rating, eschewing the boring breakfast buffet in favour of coffee and a croissant in a local favourite or swapping the south of France for less well-trodden territory.

Do this and you might even add a dollop of unexpected adventure to your sojourn. Read on to find out how to save on everything from coffees to cruises, museums to mountain retreats.

TravelHacks,"Honestly, I could complain about this for days. From so many different angles. But for me right now the problem I’m most irritated at lately is the global travelers themselves.

People seem to be only interested, or at least an overwhelming majority of people, in going places they have already seen or heard about. Massively contributing to over-tourism and overcrowding, for what? Keeping up with Jonses? Never really thinking critically about where they should go or what it might impact? Does everyone actually love art history so much that we need to queue for the Mona Lisa? Or have people just heard about it. 

Call me incredibly salty, I probably am, but I’ve worked my ass off for 4 years with my wife on a high quality travel YouTube channel entirely dedicated to off path places. To digging deep and travelling past the trip advisor. Hiking along 1000 year old medieval pilgrim paths in Tuscany with more hidden gems than you can imagine, places that desperately could do with some tourism dollars, a mere 20 minute train ride from tourist clogged Florence. I go out into the woods to show a truly authentic German beer festival where the old traditions are alive and well instead of just covering Oktoberfest. I go to the sorts of difficult Alpine Christmas markets that many locals haven’t even heard about instead of just showcasing Munich and Nuremberg. I was the only person that week to visit several Ancient Greek cities in Turkey that are mind blowing. I have these places entirely to myself, places that would love and benefit from some tourism. If only we stopped concentrating it one or two places and instead spread it around. 

Do you know what kind of viewership the truly off path stuff gets? Zilch. Nothing. A crumb. I’m faxt it negatively impacts the growth of my channel for months. 

But yet if I do a video about a place people are already familiar with? Oh boy, tons of views.

The market pressure is on the influencer to be a sell out. 

It does my head in. If you want to travel deeper and not just be another tourist then you have to put in some work and at least expose yourself to new things, but from what I can tell by the travel audience at large….this is not what they do. I’ll hold your hand and take you to the hidden gems you say you want, all you have to do is click. 

I used to blame the influencers. Then I tried to become one to break the chain and do my part. Now I see how the people who got big, got big and it’s our fault.

It breaks my heart. Truly.

— if you want to see the proof for yourself you can find me on YouTube at NearFromHome. You’ll see the viewership for itself. Or, if my content is crap then you are welcome to give me a well deserved reality check.

As many of you know, sign-up bonuses for travel cards can be very lucrative. I like to pair the Chase Sapphire (60k sign-up) with the United MileagePlus Card (50k sign-up bonus). The Chase Sapphire Reserved card has many benefits including the ability to transfer points to a variety of airlines (United, Southwest, KLM, ECT). 

Why Chase Sapphire?

The Chase Sapphire Reserved card has many benefits, hotel credits, discounts, travel insurance, ECT. It is known as one of the most comprehensive travel cards on the marked. My favorite perk is the ability to transfer points to a variety of top airlines including United, Southwest, ECT. This give me the opportunity to find the most affordable award flights and maximize my available points.

Why United Mileage Plus?

United is part of Star Alliance and has access to many of the top global airlines. They have an incredible amount of global routes, allow free bags and have a lot of award availability if you book in advance. Most importantly you can take advantage of the United Excursionist perk perk allowing you one free leg across the region you are travelling when booked with Award miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Excursionist Perk Example: In June I'm travelling from Cleveland, OH to Lisbon (30k Points), from Lisbon to Athens Greece (free with the Excursionist perk) and then returning Athens-Cleveland (30k points). So for 60k points I have a free roundtrip to Europe with an extra leg. This would have cost me $1,600 at the time of my booking and it is only half of the point sign on bonus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Taking Advantage of sign-up bonuses: You can only receive the Chase Sapphire sign on bonus every 48 months. To maximize the sign on benefits I alternate the credit cards between me and my wife every two years. I sign up in 2023 for both cards and receive the (110k point bonus). In 2025 I refer my wife for both cards (25k point referral bonus) and she receives the 110k bonus points. Every two years we alternate and this has given us enough points for two free global roundtrips (Asia, Australia, Europe) per year. You can move any leftover points to your partner as long as you are living at the same address. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tips:

Book early for the most award availability

Be flexible with your itinerary to maximize value

Shop Award availability on multiple Airlines

Take advantage of the Excursionist perk on United

TravelHacks,"I want to book a standard room on the Las Vegas strip for a weekend in March, Thursday-Sunday. The last couple of days prices have gone up for that weekend, and I’m not sure whether to wait to book or bite the bullet and reserve now before prices get worse.

I don’t have much experience with booking hotels, but I read a short article explaining that rates often plummet the week/day of your desired travel dates depending on the hotel’s occupancy rate. I’m cautious to use this approach, because one of my desired hotels already doesn’t have a room available that weekend when I choose a Thursday check-in (plenty of availability Fri-Sun). However, I see some validity to this strategy because I’ve browsed rates for check-in today and they’re all much cheaper in comparison to March.

I worry that it will be harder to get last-minute hotel deals my particular weekend because of the influx of attendees for the event I’m attending (PAC-12 basketball tournament). On the other hand, Vegas is always busy.

TravelHacks,"TL;DR

*AA flight from NYC to LA got delayed and then moved while I was on a layover in Chicago, they paid for my hotel and gave an $200 flight voucher without asking. On the return my layover was delayed by a few hours because they didn't have a pilot. I want to know if/how I can get a full refund on the entire trip because of how messed up it was.* 

I recently bought a round-trip flight from NY to LA with a layover in Chicago. On my layover my flight got delayed 3 times, before eventually getting moved to the next day. 

By the time I left the airport, it was 1 am and the flight they moved me to was at 5 am, so even though they paid for my hotel and a meal, I didn't get much sleep and by the time we landed in LA I missed the main meeting I was going there for.

On the way back I had a layover in Chicago, and it got delayed 2 times as well because they couldn't find a pilot, but we eventually left 3 hours late.

After the first delay/moved flight on the way there I got an automatic email from American Airlines saying they gave me 15,000 points (or about a $200) credit, but I honestly feel like that's not fair since I had to reschedule the meeting I was going there for and they also delayed my return flight. 

**Can I still get a full refund or a larger travel credit?** 

**If so, is there anything I should know before trying?**

I'm worried that since I got on the first flight they rebooked to 5 am, I'm not entitled to a refund. Also I'm not sure if my delays on the return flight justify a larger credit.",Can I still get a flight refund?,,mediumslushy,,0,2023-02-15 18:27:49

Hi All,

I've done a little bit of travel in my life, but never this extensive, and for work. Past work travel was in the US, and for a few nights in a major city, Boston, NYC, etc. I lived overseas for 3 years in the Middle East, and have been international a few times. I am looking for any travel trips for a 12-day trip from US East Coast to several islands in the Caribbean. I plan to go business casual but don't want to lug a huge suitcase. I'm thinking one carry-on size hard shell suitcase, and a backpack. Some lightweight khakis and 4 company long sleeve polos, and boat shoes, and a pair of flip flops, toiletries, etc. Any packing tips, for things to bring that I may not anticipate? I am not very sure about the shopping situation on these islands. Also, any cultural advice to not make an American fool out of myself? I will be taking small airplanes between islands, can I even take a suitcase on those? I don't really take any medicine, but I will take essentials with me, will that be an issue for customs? I will be traveling with my boss the whole time. We get along well, but any tips for that relationship? Do's/Do Nots? Also, this is my first time away from my wife and daughter for this long. I think Im just rambling at this point. Ill take any advice anyone is willing to give.

I would share the experience even just for fun I've recently thought of being an airbnb host and in addition to that be like a guide to pack someone's itinerary with activities etc and transportation included. Taxi fares are expensive and alot of these tourist spots just gouge tourists. I'm a hiker , outdoors kind of person and I love meeting people. I think having an airbnb setup and also the exclusive vybz of going out with new friends to places off the beaten path.

TravelHacks,"Your friends will be enemies by the time you leave this place if you don't do these things. This comes from someone who lived in Miami and always visits. 

1. You and your group need to have a similar budget. DO NOT come here with one person having a $700 budget and another person having a $5000 budget. It is not going to work - I promise. The person with the $700 budget is going to want to do cheaper activities - exa: only go jet skiing, while the person with $5000 is gonna want to eat at the finest restaurants, go on a yacht, parasailing, etc. Miss/Mr. $700 is gonna be salty and your trip is going to be ruined
2. Splitting checks is NOT a thing. If there is going to be let's say 6 people - they will give you one check. You all have to be ready to have ONE person pay that check and everybody else needs to pay them back. The best way to go about this is to assign each person a day to pay. One person gets Monday, one person gets Tuesday, etc. 
3. Come in even numbers. Problems ALWAYS arise when there is a trio or an uneven amount of people. An Uber X fits 4 people, so stop trying to squeeze that extra one person in. An UberXL can only fit 6 people. Everything in Miami is in partners (2 people). Don't have one person left out. A lot of time, that left out person will have to pay extra (like on jet skis and other activites). It just isn't a good vibe. 
4. Know your alcohol tolerance and your friends' alcohol tolerance. Some of y'all like to drink A LOT and start issues. Last year, I watched a girl get in a fight with the wrong group of people, and let's just say the entire south beach was shut down. If you know that you're the type person who gets rowdy and obnoxious when drunk, do not drink too much. It ruins the trip for everybody else. 
5. Ladies, you need heels to get in basically everywhere - esp clubs. If you know that your feet are going to hurt easily, have an extra pair of shoes in your bag or get some numbing spray so you can last all night. Nobody wants to hear that your feet are hurting and you wanna go home. 
6. Men will be charged for EVERYTHING. It is impossible to be a bum here. Find a promoter. It can save you hundreds of dollars. If you're a guy, find a promoter and go half and half in their section. Promoters will pay for literally everything if you're a girl - the yachts, drinks, etc. 
7. Don't swim at restaurants! It is common for them to have pools inside. That water is not clean at all. 
8. Lots of FREE activities. People gatekeep the free activities, but there are Museums, waterfalls, etc. 
9. Be prepared to run into celebrities. It is so common. Quavo has walked past me while I was on south beach. I've seen Roddy Rich as well. They are there to have a good time just like you are. 
10. Last one, but look up the music they're playing at the clubs you plan on going to. I have spent $90 to go somewhere and I hated the music the entirety of the night.","You're coming to Miami for spring break? LISTEN UP!

I already have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, I'm debating getting the Amex Platinum and using delta for flights so I can get access to their lounge/hangout, but open for anything if it makes sense 

Thoughts? Help?

TravelHacks," Reposting my content because it got deleted in the other subreddit. I double checked their rules and there wasnt any that I have broken at all. I am reposting because when I had an issue with [booking.com](https://booking.com), there's none at all how they work (rebooking if cancelled etc). So I am hoping this post may help a few solo / group / family travellers in the future. Now going back:

[Booking.com](https://booking.com/) is great for solo and short stays. But sucks when you experience last minute cancellation. The only thing they could offer is

1. There only option is a Complete refund that would take 'business days' before you receive it back from your bank. They don't have any booking credits/coupon that you can receive asap so you can still immediately use the money that you pay for towards rebooking another place.
2. a maximum of 25 Euro price difference should the next listing you book with them is higher. And this 25 euro is something you can only claim and be refunded after your stay.
3. Their chat support isn't really a chat platform. You type something, and you won't be able to type anymore until the support responds. You also cannot ask for a callback through there

So unless you have enough money on your bank, lives in the US, UK / have enough money for a long distance call, just don't use [booking.com](https://booking.com/) for holiday stay with your family.

As for Airbnb? Yeah sometimes they suck, the only reason you don't get a response immediately is because a case manager works on urgent tickets simultaneously, but what is the difference if you get last minute cancelled by your host?

1. You choose to refund the money you paid for or get a booking credits/coupon instead. An option you want to choose so your refund goes towards the next rebooking instantly
2. Airbnb is better for rebooking. They will cover all extra cost. Even up to 100% of the previous cancelled reservation if there are limited listings available in the area. You don't have to have money in your bank, they will issue a coupon on their system and use that to cover the difference.
3. You can have someone call you from their chat

From my experience, the only reason why people hate Airbnb is because these people are entitled, don't know how airbnb works, don't know their TOS, don't have proof of their claims or simply the support theyre dealing with is an idiot which is a minority. But hey, what company doesn't have idiotic customer supports nowadays?",Booking.com Sucks on last minute cancellation.

1. Any specific travel insurance that is better rated - for service and claims?

I am unsure if this is the right sub to ask this question, if it is not I apologize!  I also know there likely aren’t many places in the states that have accommodations that include individuals with limited mobility, but my mom called me practically desperate to help try and get my very independent grandmother out of the house more. 

My grandmother is in her 80s and has a really hard time moving around and getting up. She uses a walker and needs the appropriate accommodations for her to use her bathroom without assistance, but can’t be alone. 

Looking online has yielded practically nothing, so I’m wondering if anyone has come across any hotels/overnight accommodations within Texas and/or Colorado that were very accommodating for individuals that have limited mobility? 

If there are any, I’d like to look more into them and check them out before sharing. My grandmother used to travel a bunch (mainly Colorado) so having to stay at home is grating on her and we all hate how frustrated she is. Trying to find ways we can get her out again.

When picking up the car I was again asked if I wanted insurance.  I declined stating that my Amex Platinum card provides coverage and I don't need additional insurance.  Agent says okay and has my sign the contract which is all in French (I don't speak French)  As I'm signing I notice that the amount that he authorized my credit card for is 565e...my reservation was for $411.  I ask why the charge is different and the agent tells my that they authorize the card for greater than the reservation amount to cover incidentals.  He says that when I return the car, the amount will be adjusted to the reservation amount as long as the tank is full and there is no damage to the car.

I return the car last Sunday and notice that I've been charged the full 565e.  I question the charge and they tell me that the difference is for the additional insurance coverage I selected.  I told them that I declined the coverage.  They apologize and say that their manager is gone and won't be back until Monday so they can't adjust the charge.  They email the manager and tell me to call customer service to get this situated.  I say okay and go on my way.  Well today I call customer service and they tell me that because I signed the contract there isn't much they can do about it.  They declined to reverse the additional charge.

Rental agents are commissioned on upsells.  The agent lied to me and had me sign a contract in a language that I don't understand.  Now Avis is refusing to do the right thing because the contract was signed by me.  I've initiated a charge back with Amex, so who knows if I will get the money back or not.

As I walked, I had a vision of a cool and free traveling app that could help me discover new places and learn about the city's attractions. I was at a crossroads in my life and this idea gave me a new sense of purpose and direction.

When I returned home, I set to work on creating the app. I had no personnel, no investments, and no backing - it was just me and my passion for exploring. I put in long hours and poured my heart and soul into the project.

The result is easy to use and provides some information about the user's surroundings. It's too raw, I know, but I am proud of what I have created, and I hope that it can help others discover new sights and attractions in their own city.

So... if I am going to spend a whole day stuck on a series of flights, it needs to be at least business class. I'm prepared to pay a premium, but the typical upcharge from economy to business class is just too much to justify.

TravelHacks,"i’m looking to rent a mid-size SUV in Montreal. i usually rent from the Hertz at the on airport rental counter, but i decided to investigate the prices for an off airport location and found it to be cheaper. 

from what i can see on the site i’m using, it’s approximately $1,900 to rent the vehicle for a month from the airport location, and $1,300 at the off airport hertz location. 

i think the off site location would be about 15 minutes away by Uber and cost around $30USD. 

what i’m wondering is, is it worth it to do this, or is there any different/greater risk of that location running out of cars or something?

From my personal experience, whenever I travel and visit a new place, I google the top things to do, the top restaurants to visit, local dishes, places to go out at night, some common phrases to learn in the local language and so on. It is very time-consuming when checking different websites and often the websites are plastered with a wall of advertisements.

Out of the need to simplify this, Travelmoji -travelmoji.xyz was born.

It uses OpenAI and ChatGPT to provide you with a timestamped itinerary and other additional info in less than a minute (compared to hour-long google searching). Travelmoji makes it easy to plan your stay and get the most out of it, all at your fingertips and powered by AI.

Would be great if you have 5-10 min to look into it and also provide me with some tips on how to make this product a success.

I wanted to get some specific feedback from you if you

1) Would you consider using Travelmoji

2) What do you like about Travelmoji

3) What needs improvement

4) What other things would you like to have included and would make it easier for you when you plan your travel

TravelHacks,"I just started traveling for work again this past week. I did fairly well the first half of last year with losing excess weight, but then gained back during the holidays, special events, etc.

I thought I had a decent plan for losing weight while on the road for work, but now I'm not sure about it. My goal was to get up and have hotel breakfast such as eggs, fruit, yogurt, and perhaps turkey sausage. Then for lunch, if clients wanted to provide lunch, I'd have that so as not to offend, and if lunch were not provided, I would have a protein bar/shake or similar. Then for dinner, I'd either skip if I was still full from lunch, or maybe have chicken &amp; vegetables or similar.

This past week, I did pretty well for breakfast. Lunch was mostly fattening stuff (which was really tasty, lol), but I tried to not over-indulge. Then my new co-worker who I travel with this week and next wanted to go out to eat every evening at Olive Garden, etc. I ended up feeling like I spent the entire week eating. I'm afraid to weigh myself now in case I gained. 

Also, I went to the hotel gym, but found the equipment to be dirty and grimy, and several pieces in disrepair. I've purchased some resistance bands to use in room, so hopefully this will help.

I am flying from London -&gt; Las Vegas (for a bachelorette party - the bride and other attendees live in the US, while I live in London) -&gt; Tampa (visit family while in US) -&gt; Atlanta (for a separate friends wedding) -&gt; London all within 2 weeks. I did research on American Airlines and I could do the total 4 flights for 125K points + $441-$600 (the higher price option is if I want direct flights internationally). 

Does this seem like a good deal to use points?The international flights are 30K points each, whereas the flight from LAS -&gt; TPA is 50K points. I have around 160K points on American and have hardly used them as I live in London now and hardly travel throughout the US, and when I do find it to be a better deal to just pay the fee and collect points.

Alternatively, if I don’t use points it would cost around $1.9K for all of the flights currently.

Everyone says you should get out of Reykjavik asap and explore Ring Road. But how do you determine where to stay while driving? Should you plan your days based on driving a certain number of kilometers or visiting x amount of landmarks and find beds within those zones? 

Do you have to book hotels in advance or can you easily find a safe place to stay after driving and realizing you want to call it a day?

If me and my friend fly in to Venice, wait for them to arrive so we can all to link up and continue through italy together, my friend and I will be in Venice for five days.

TravelHacks,"I'm planning my trip to Japan on Feb 12 - Mar 3 and was looking for places to crash on the booking.com. Since I’m the type of person who wants to save coin everywhere I can, I searched for properties while using a VPN and compared prices to ones I got from my residential IP. I’m based in the EU.

I’d say 4 out of 5 times properties came out costing less in **¥** when I searched connected to a Japanese VPN server. For a 4 night stay, on average, you can expect to save around 60EUR (8500JPY). Here’s a few examples:

* With VPN [https://imgur.com/a/sqOzbWx](https://imgur.com/a/sqOzbWx)
* No VPN [https://imgur.com/a/2V6FJnp](https://imgur.com/a/2V6FJnp)

So how to save money on booking.com?

1. Use a good VPN, not a free one. I was using NordVPN;
2. Connect to Japanese VPN server and login to your Booking.com account;
3. Start searching accommodation for your trip;
4. Compare the price with the one you get from your local IP address and pick the best deal.

Be aware of the properties which receive NTS subsidies (they’re marked with green National Travel Support disclaimer next to each such property). The price in JPY will be much less but if you’re not a Japanese resident you’ll need to pay the difference upon arrival.

So before booking a place, do your research, browse booking.com with a VPN on, and (fingers-crossed) find a better deal for your trip.",How to save coin on booking.com with a VPN?,,initialrotation,,0,2023-02-02 11:17:53

TravelHacks,"Hi! So I’ve only travelled via plane once in my life and it was many many years ago with luggage that had been tossed for just as many years for being old and damaged. I planned on going to Japan for a month this summer and the airline only allows one (1) checked bag and since I don’t own luggage currently I’ve been looking into getting something new. 

The current issue is the suitcase I found that I liked is over the 62” linear limit. It’s roughly 63.5” linear inches. So I’m wondering if that extra inch is going to cost me (can they tell if it’s an inch over on sight? I never saw an agent break out the tape measure when I was going through airports that one trip…) Or should I just keep looking for one that’s actually under the 62” limit to be safe? I heard it’s more the weight they worry about instead of an inch or so because I’m not out looking for a 70+ inch bag, but I’m not 100% on that.

TravelHacks,"Hi all, I'll be in Oahu for 8 full days in March (not counting arrival and departure dates). Looking for some guidance on renting a car.

Below are activities or places that interest me (not comprehensive and I'm open to suggestions or tips here as well!):

- Snorkeling (do any places give basic lessons?)
- North shore 
- Turtle bay
- Whale watching if that's an option this time of year
- Surf lesson(s)
- Shark dive
- Karaoke spots
- Hikes with a nice view (is Diamond Head a must, if so, what time?)
- Latin dancing
- Waterfalls
- Quieter/serene spots that are not disrespectful/intrusive to natives (I know, this may not exist in some people's eyes, especially in Oahu)
- Tantalus Road
- Sunset at Makaha (do you recommend or any other spots for sunrise/sunset?)
- Best quality seafood, including poke and sushi (especially if they have great menu items besides shrimp)

I'm staying in Waikiki and want to rent a car for at least part of my trip just for practicality's sake. That being said, while I'm pretty active, I don't need to fit a dozen activities into every single day. 

My main reasons for wanting a car is so on active days, I'm not tied to a single area after arriving by bus, if I hear about a cool nearby spot that isn't walking distance, and so I can go back to rest at my place between activities with ease. I'm okay with some slower days where I only do one or two non-food activities and get around with public transportation or on foot. 

For the sorts of things I'm interested in, could I build an itinerary where I don't need a car for the WHOLE trip while not missing a chance to explore the beautiful island?

Any input on specific renting companies is appreciated!

I was in Perth yesterday, not the one in western Australia where I lived years ago but in the original one, where all the Perth in the world got their names, the reason for the day trip was random no real reasons except that looking at old pictures in Facebook triggered the idea to visit the town….ops, city, seems like they are quite emotional about the topic.


The river Tay with the gloomiest day ever since I’m in Scotland, a reflection of what I feel lately ?
Weather was nothing like the sister in OZ and instead of the Kangaroos a lot of sheep, obviously as soon I decided for this trip I started to see everywhere advertising about Perth, love synchronicities and the feeling to be on the right life path, booked the train ticket at 5 am, regretted later, I arrived at 7 am and was dark, cold, raining but got me the time to sightseeing as much I could of this pretty medieval village, I have to be honest it didn’t impress me much and I won’t go back but it’s worthed if you never been before, the countryside is beautiful but it get dull quickly, the best part are the castles in the middle of nowhere surrounded by green lands, I won’t forget the fact that those buildings were built exploiting the local population, they might look great now but it is important to remember how many people had to suffer for few to live inside those representation of greediness and power.


Probably the prettiest part of the town
Wandering around memories from the past started hunting me and funnily enough wasn’t from Perth in Australia but from a Korean girl met in New Zealand, it was hunting my thoughts and I felt she was trying to reach me, I felt it even more real when in front a Ballet studio the name of the business owner was the same as her, obviously the girl I was thinking about is a Ballet teacher too, able to build a wall within my mind I restarted my walk lighter, the other interesting encounter was when out of blue I begun to think to a project started years ago for a cafe’-pizzeria with my brother and a Thai friend that we decided to call ”3 brothers” walking through this street I felt compelled to look on my right and in front of me ”3 brothers pizzeria-restaurant, a sign from the universe that is going to happen ? Hope so, would be great to start a business in Thailand, the only Asian country that match my personality.


3 Brothers restaurant, one day might be the face of my brother, my Thai brother and me on that sign
The day passed by nicely even if bloody freezing, at the end of the day I found that the most beautiful part of the trip was the beautiful hill to the other side of the river and the magical and mystical monastery, I could feel the spirituality of the place that was peaceful and soothing.


I believe that human beings can’t live without religion, it give us a purpose, a reason to be here on Earth, not as a random act but with a specific reason


The only place where everyone is the same and the accommodation free
Perth is worth a visit but maybe not two


The only colours I seen that day

They are probably smarter then us",Perth !!!! Where did you hide the sun ?,,Peaceandlove79,,0,2023-01-30 05:24:35

I'm an international student moving to Hamburg in February. I booked my flight with pegasus, the 'eko' option, where i get 20 kg of checked baggage, and 1 piece of cabin baggage.

We paid for a vacation car rental via Expedia and when we got off our flight and to the airport rental counter they told us they didn’t have a car for us. We called Expedia and they said there’s nothing they can do as customer service line doesn’t open until Monday. We had to go to another rental company and paid the higher costs since it was a walk up rental.

So now we have to go get a refund from Expedia but they aren’t budging at all on taking responsibility for selling us the reservation with the rental company that they couldn’t deliver on. We’re out about $500 extra because of THEIR mistake. Is there anything that Expedia should be doing (Expedia Rewards points) or that we (from a legal standpoint) can do to recoup our extra $500?

English is not my first language and I am on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.

My finance and I are planing a trip to Las Vegas with her mother sometime in June. 
We would go by plane either from Ljubljana airport or from Venice.
Now I have several questions since this is my first time traveling somewhere so far away.

1. Where do I buy plane tickets?
- I looked on Skyscanner/kayak/cheapoflyghts and price-something (cant rememer, searched in incognito), found a flight that was around 790€ pp for a round trip operated by British Airways. If I go to buy directly from their website the price is 1250€ pp which is a big difference. Do you recommend third party sellers or should I book directly on BA website?

2. Which hotel in Las Vegas do you recommend? Is the food or at least breakfast included in the cost of a hotel or do you pay extra? If it is extra where do you recommend we eat - the hotel restaurant or somewhere else?

3. We are mostly going there because my future MIL likes casinos, so we will definetly be visiting some. What are the things we must whatch out for in a casino that may be differtent to casinos in EU?

4. What are some other sites you recommend we see there? We will be there for 4-5 nights.

5. We probably need a visa to enter the US am I correct?

I think that is all for now, but I will probably have more questions in the future.

Being skeptical of that I called the hotel myself to verify sure enough it was confirmed details correct no issues. They even provided me with a confirmation code(hotel).

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone - graduated this past fall and I'm looking for an unforgettable travel experience before I start working full time! Hoping that this subreddit can help me find the most frugal way to travel.

For an idea of my current plans and preferences:

1. Flying from the US (AUS), typically fly with Delta but I don't have a strong airline preference aside from not wanting to fly on Spirit/Allegiant/Frontier.

2. For accommodation, I would prefer a private room. I'm fine with shared bathrooms. Typically stay in hotels/AirBnBs during past travels, but I'm trying to gradually warm up to hostels for budget reasons!

3. During my travels, most interested in food (love all types of food, from street food to Michelin star cuisine. This is where I'm most wiling to splurge) and sightseeing (both nature and man-made). I don't like driving, so walkable places or places with strong public transportation/bus systems are a big plus!

4. No geographic restrictions. Quick note that I have been to quite a few of the main cities in the US in the last year (CHI/DC/BOS/NYC/DEN/DAL).

5. For current plans, I'm looking at a 1.5 - 2 week trip to all of Amsterdam/Copenhagen/Norway/Spain sometime in April. I expect this to cost $2500 - $3000 (I have a few credits that can lower the cost of the flight). IT IS NOT SET IN STONE. I could scrap the trip, modify it to include more/less locations, or do anything in between. Solely optimizing for the best travel experience (based on my previously mentioned preferences) for the budget I have.

Any advice, itinerary ideas, or helpful links/resources are all incredibly appreciated! If there's another sub I should post this in, please let me know!",Just graduated college - I have 6 months and $5000 set aside for traveling!,,Daneity,,0,2023-01-27 23:39:45

TravelHacks,"The Beatles, a well-known English rock band, visited Rishikesh in the 1960s, making it known as the “**Yoga Capital of the World**.” The well-known band spent time at *Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Ashram* in search of **spirituality**.

When visiting this **spiritual city**, spending some time at this ashram is a given, but there are a lot of other places that demand your attention. Start the day off well with some **river rafting** at *Shivpuri*, a quick bite at one of the cafes along the water, and a stroll down Laxman Jhula’s eclectic collection of businesses.

Finally, relax at the ghat and lose yourself in the evening’s breathtakingly beautiful **Ganga Aarti**. And if you want a detailed roadmap to help you organize your entire trip, this is the guide for you. Keep reading to learn about the [top tourist destinations in Rishikesh:](https://nomadfreaks.com/best-places-to-visit-in-rishikesh-2/)

1. Laxman Jhula, the beginning of the trip to Rishikesh!

If you’re **planning a trip to Rishikesh**, don’t miss out on **Laxman Jhula**, a mythological bridge that is considered an integral part of the city. Tapovan and Jonk, two Garhwal villages, are linked by a suspension bridge 137 metres in length that crosses the Ganga River.

2. River rafting in Rishikesh

Among all the activities available in India, **rafting in Rishikesh** is without a doubt the most exciting and memorable experience you can have. Everything about this location is top-notch, from the naturally favourable conditions to the quality of the available human support. There are specialised **camping** and **rafting** packages available in **Rishikesh**, as well as a few well-known operators with excellent safety precautions. If you’re looking for a relaxing vacation, rafting companies will take care of all the details, including food and water. During the busiest times of the year, Rishikesh may get quite crowded, so keep that in mind when you make your travel plans.

3. Ganga Aarti, Rishikesh

When conducted on the ghats of Rishikesh at dusk, **Ganga Aarti** is the holiest and most auspicious of all rituals. Although the aarti is done at numerous ghats, Parmath Niketan Ghat and Triveni Ghat are the most famous. Smoke from the hawans rises into the air, lighting up the riverbank with beautiful floating diyas. Listening to the bells of a temple ring, hearing devotees chant sacred chants, and taking in the atmosphere is truly once in a lifetime.

4. Rishikesh’s Kunjapuri Devi Temple

The **Kunjapuri Devi Temple**, dedicated to Parvathi, the Hindu goddess, may be found at the peak of the **Kunjapuri hill**. In addition to the fact that it is one of Uttarakhand’s fifty-two Shaktipeeth, the shrine is well-known for its entrancing location, which provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the Shivalik range and the majestic peaks of Chaukhamba and Bandarpunch. This panorama is one of the reasons the shrine is so popular.

6. Temple of Neelkantha Mahadeva

The **Neelkanth Mahadev Temple** may be found in the midst of a verdant forest at an elevation of 1,670 metres and is located approximately 12 kilometres away from the city of **Rishikesh**. It is considered to be one of the holiest Shiva shrines in all of India and is highly recommended as a **destination for tourists in Rishikesh**. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva drank poison during Samudramanthan, a battle between the gods and the demons, at the site of the temple.",Best places to visit in Rishikesh,,nitinkumar_7178,,0,2023-01-27 12:18:29

TravelHacks,"In Europe, usually you have to pay to use a public toilet. I've found that despite that, they are usually not that clean and not always you can pay by card, which means you need to have coins ready. 

However, something I often do locally (I am German and live in Frankfurt), is to go to any university building and use their toilet. They are free, quiet and most of the time very clean. The only dirty toilets you'll find there are usually only in buildings, which are frequented by many students (buildings which contain many lecture halls for example).


University buildings can mean lecture halls, student canteens, faculties of whatever subject and libraries. 

That way, in Frankfurt alone, I know of at least 15 places, which are spread all over the city and where I can always find a clean and free toilet.

The most clean and quiet toilets are usually found in the university buildings, which deal with more niche subjects. For example, i've found that in Frankfurt, the buildings for medicine students usually have the most clean toilets followed by the physics building.

From my limited research, it looks as though you can double dip via Hyatt and American. Do any other airlines/hotels partner together to get miles/points when you book one or the other?

I like that with National Emerald Club you can just pick a car a go. Do any other car rental companies offer this? Is it better to get car rental points or link the reward to air miles?

However my upcoming trip is funded for the most part by points (with only 2 shorter flights being paid out of pocket). Since they’re points funded, my assumption is that the credit card protection no longer applies. ( as most policies require the trip to be paid with the credit card you’d claim on).   My question is whether my assumption is correct and I should spring for insurance or is my assumption wrong?  Since it’s a bit more of a pricey itinerary if I paid out of pocket I want to make sure I’m adequately protected.

I've been working on ""**One Second Diary**"" - a video diary app inspired by this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day).

The idea itself is pretty simple:

* Open the app at the moment of your day that you would like to remember in the future
* Tap the Record button and save a short video (or upload from gallery)
* That's it, open the app the next day and repeat the process

Then, after a couple months or even years:

* Tap the button to generate a compilation of all those videos, creating the movie of your life

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It's perfect for documenting the places you have been to, easily exporting a movie that contains the date, locale and subtitles for each recording.**

&amp;#x200B;

The app is packed with features:

* Add or edit subtitles in the videos
* Add automatic or manual geotagging on top of the videos
* Choose the date format and color to show on top of the videos
* Create profiles to save videos separately
* View all recorded days in a calendar
* Generate custom movies by periods or selected videos only
* Receive scheduled daily notifications
* Dark Mode
* Available in 8 languages

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, it's totally free, without ads.

&amp;#x200B;

TravelHacks,"If you're going on something organized or to a country where the medical care is readily available and good, you can disregard this tip. This is for people really going bush, going out to the open sea or the high arctic, going potentially days or weeks travel from anything resembling a medical clinic - people who may need emergency access to antibiotics and other medications that normally require a prescription. These are the trips on which you're taking a full suturing kit.

You need an expert travel medicine doctor and I guess you also need to be the sort of person whom a doctor would trust with medications normally only administered by professionals. Usually that's fellow scientists etc, but if you're planning a real 'expedition' travel adventure and need to be able to look after yourself, you need to have an appointment with a doctor with relevant experience in supporting remote travel and extraction, and go over what you need. You can go straight to a $$$ commercial business that supports this kind of stuff (eg [https://covacglobal.com/](https://covacglobal.com/)) or just look for a local travel medical clinic or private medical practice that supports expedition travel for vaccinations etc.

If you don't want to do it this way, you can still get hold of broad spectrum antibiotics and prescription strength topical sulfacetamide-type treatments without going through a doctor. Sadly, the whole 'resistance' argument is BS when the global agricultural industry is chugging down powerful antibiotics like there's no tomorrow. Just get online and buy your stuff from the same places that agricultural and fisheries businesses do. It's the same pills from the same factory, even if they lie about it and say it's not - for liability reasons. This for when you need something effective within 12-24 hours or it's going to mess up your whole trip and potentially kill you - e.g. broken bone(s) or large infected wound, serious bacterial ear or eye infection, really nasty parasite etc.

I am guessing this comment is going to get a bit of blowback from people objecting to 'breaking the rules' to get prescription strength medicines even if it's perfectly legal (it is) and perfectly safe IF you (and your expedition doctor, if you have one) know what you're doing (it is). If you are clueless about how these treatments work and when / how to use them, this advice is NOT for you. I'm just addressing the issue of supply here.

A note to US-based travelers. Be aware that you can get some things over the counter in Asia, Middle East, Europe and elsewhere that require a prescription in the USA. An example is or was the painkiller sometimes sold as voltaren, though I think just recently you can now get that without a prescription in the US - it used to be something you could buy OTC in Asia but not in the USA. Various de-wormers and other useful meds are easier to get in many countries. I use my travel to these countries as opportunities to pick up things from a pharmacy / apotheke that I can use later. Just remember that the medication will likely be sold under a different name elsewhere.",Taking it to 11: point 11 travel tip - what's in your medical kit,,UWarchaeologist,,0,2023-01-25 19:44:56

TravelHacks,"To add to the list:

1. Vacuum compression bags for clothes. Once you use them, you'll wonder how you travelled without them.
2. For long flights and long days where you maybe sleep on a train overnight and don't get to change clothes, and more especially underwear, bring some very light panty liners.  Swapping them out is like having a fresh pair of underwear.
3. Visiting high-impact tourism cities in high season (Venice, Rome, Florence, Istanbul)? Don't be the cool adventurer traveler who wouldn't be caught dead in an organized tour or cruise. Being part of a pre-arranged tour or cruise is what allows you to skip that 3-hour line into the Vatican or Topkapi palace and actually see the stuff you came to see.
4. You don't need that restaurant meal, at least not more than once a day. Buy a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese and some apples or whatever is the local snack.
5. Put the camera away. It's liberating to enjoy travel without feeling that it didn't happen without a selfie and a social media post.
6. Scan your passport, itinerary, contact information, drivers license, bank phone numbers etc and put it all on a google drive that is shared with family or a trusted contact back home. If you lose everything, it's incredibly useful to have.
7. For more adventurous travel, a quart bag medical kit should have cold and flu symptom relief pills, motion sickness treatment, bandage tape (anything can be a bandage, so you just need the tape), pain killers, zinc and vitamin C tabs, antihistamine, anti diarrheal medicine, UTI treatment if you're prone to UTI's, location specific meds eg for malaria, and a broad spectrum antibiotic that you educate yourself on the appropriate time and way to use).
8. Travelling alone is awesome. Bring a few small representative gifts or items from your own country to give to people who befriend and/or help you on your travels.
9. Love a cup of tea or coffee or just want to boil water? You can get small portable folding compact kettles to boil water from any electrical outlet and have that cuppa anytime.
10. If you are spending more than a few hours in any city, master the public transport system and use it to get around.",10 More best travel tips not on that list of 50,,UWarchaeologist,,0,2023-01-25 03:52:20

Long story short, my wife and I are expecting and hoping all goes to plan, we would like to travel with the baby a couple of months after the delivery. Has anyone booked a ticket for an unborn baby?

TravelHacks,"Hi, I am thinking about going to Hawaii for a week or so in March. First time there besides a brief layover. 

I don't travel much so I'm trying to make the most of this excursion in the way that I enjoy to travel. I prefer moving a more measured pace. I don't rush to get as many photo opps at popular sites as I can during my trips and I don't mind going back to my room for a nap after a good meal even though it's ""wasting the day."" 

But I'm also a single dude (31) who enjoys going out dancing and meeting people. I stay fairly active and would love to do a few surfing lessons, go snorkeling, and of course, hike and take in amazing sights. 

Given this description, what would be your recommendation? Both of my friends who live or have lived in Hawaii recommend Oahu if it's my first trip, while Reddit seems to skew more towards Maui or doing both. I'm sure I'll have a blast in any case, but all input is welcome!

Example from when I worked as a travel agent: honeymooners told me to book them ANY hotel in Istanbul with a suite (no budget). Based on reviews and previous honeymooners I booked the kempinski. They hated it! They hated the style which so many other praised (I couldn't even blame them. I wouldn't have liked it myself either but again: everyone's different).

Also on those sites you can select what you want to spend and what area you want to stay in, which are big factors.

People tend to suggest hotels they stayed at based on their overall holiday experience rather than the ""quality"" of their hotel. Even if it was years ago and several things could have changed since.

I think the hotel is an important aspect of your travel and it needs to suit YOU. 

Rather than asking for specific hotels, ask for regions to stay in (in Paris for example). 

Just my thoughts as I've seen a few people asking on here and don't want them to be disappointed. 

Ps: I'm not saying that any suggestions were bad, just saying that people should still do their own research afterwards and not just rely on the suggestions given",Don't rely on others when it comes to hotel recommendations.,,menalii,,0,2023-01-22 12:51:46

Also I'll only have my hand luggage on the plane and I'll be working in Spain for one month before this, so I'm trying not to go anywhere too cold as I'll only have one coat with me and I also thinking of budget as staying there so long is getting expensive! 

I'm looking for any tips and things to do, day trips and if Lugano, Como, Verona and Venice are really my best options of cities to visit. Hotels and restaurants or even things to eat that you'd say is traditional are also appreciated! 

Right now my idea is: 

4 - 9 Milan with one day trip to Lugano and maybe a soccer game at San Siro 

Get a train in the morning to Verona and spend around 5 hours there and a train to Venice after. 

9 - 13 Venice 

13 maybe go back to Milan to take the plane from there instead of Venice Airport as I'm seeing it's cheaper, but open to suggestions. 

13 - 15 Amsterdam, I know it's not a lot here, but I only really want to visit Rijksmuseum as most things I wanted to do I already did in 2019 when I visit for the first time.

TravelHacks,"This is long , I apologize. I have a fear of heights, and planes. I flew from Vegas to New York 8 times as a child/teen. My First flight I was like 4 so I don’t remember much. Just an overall uncomfortable feeling once we took off , I remember I didn’t like it but I was so young I probably fell asleep. My first “long” flight as an 8 year old I was freaking out so much the flight attendant was visibly very worried and asked my mom if I was ok. My mom said oh yeah and told me to calm down and stop embarrassing her. flight home they drugged me. As a teen it got worse , I tried being ms.coolio but as soon as we took off I started hyperventilating and crying again. Flashback to the last 2 flights I took as a 20 year old. 
Overwhelming feeling of doom. It was like no fear I had ever felt ever. One flight was from NOLA to LAX and the whole time I wished for death rather then continue flying. Hands and knees uncontrollably shaking, tightness in my chest, rapid breathing , tears the whole 6 hours. Typing it out has me tearing up and my throat closing. Last fight was from Vegas to salt lake , then from there to Hawaii. I got drunk and took about 4 Benadryl. I get to the plane and it’s absolutely tiny, all of the drowsiness is gone, full on panic sets in. The flight back to Vegas was the most fear inducing horrible time ever. I didn’t stop shaking for hours after. Every time I’ve flown it’s been with people who comfort me the whole time and are experienced flyers. On the last flight my aunt who’s literally flown everywhere in the world and also has a fear looked at me and said ,you really really don’t like this , I can tell, the terror is in your face 
I’ve done so much research to try and help my fear , I know it’s safer then a car , I know this . It dosnt stop my knees from shaking anytime I get near an airport or hear a plane. I’ve faced my fears so many times for years , it’s worse now. Frozen in Debilitating real fear as soon as I step on a plane. 
On the other hand I’ve never been scared of boats, I’ve been on cruise ships, tiny boats, boats in rough seas and on whale watching boats that are going full speed ahead toward a blue whale and I’m at the bow like rose having the time of my life. The ocean is a welcome place for me , especially being a California girl. 
How do I travel without making myself miserable?  I have such a desire to travel with such a real fear. Can I just take a cruise to Europe plan to be there for a month and take a cruise back? Anybody else who has faced their fear and decided ,,, yeah …no. 
I did it , so many times , hoping I’d get over it and I decided it’s not getting better it’s getting worse…. 
Also I’m located in the us , I want go to Scotland at least in my life time 18 hour plane ride , I would have to be knocked out.

What exactly scares me?: 
heights, 
the confined space of planes,
the fact I’m in the air and don’t belong there, the turbulence(I know it’s nothing to be scared of)
take off is the absolute worst . Literally I’d rather be dead then go through another takeoff.

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,

Does anyone know how I can set a generic price alert for entire regions on relevant platforms for overnight stays, i.e. [booking.com](https://booking.com), Airbnb etc., if I don't refer to a specific place?

The background is: E.g. I live in germany and I simply want to go to the foothills of the Alps, no matter if south of Munich, Füssen, Oberstdorf - the main thing is in / near the mountains. actually, only the accommodation price is important to me; I find exciting and sensible tours everywhere. Even during the week is an option, as I would then simply work from home.

And I'm sure that with a bit of spontaneity and advance planning, you can find absolute bargains, because there are certainly some hosts who want to fill their rooms at the last minute.

A meta search platform would probably be best, as I don't necessarily reach all the small niche portals with Booking / AirBnb.

Let's say I am booking a return flight back home on the 20th and 21st.

On the 20th: I fly from Seoul, layover in LA for 2 hours, then to New York. Travel time is 20 hours  
On the 21st: Fly from Seoul, layover in LA for 24 HOURS, to New York. Travel time is 44 freaken hours  
Both are arond the same price

The thing is for the 21st does have the option to pretty much have the same exact return schedule but that's an extra $600. It's literally the same exact airline/plane/ and flight number. 

Because of that, I was thinking if I do arrive in LA on the 21st, is it a thing to ask the gate agents if they can just simply add me in the flight home instead of the next day? Basically try to add myself in the return flight and not pay that $600. Of course if all the seats are filled, I'll understand and wait the next day. But seems so weird it wont give me the option to take the earlier flight when clearly there's still room in the plane.

TravelHacks,"Hi Everyone,

Basically wanted to ask this. I made the mistake of buying a flight from Toronto to Barcelona that has a fly over in Paris and I am worried about any flight cancelation / delay, baggage getting lost in the connecting flight. 

I thought I bought the ticket with my card with travel insurance and baggage insurance but I bought it with my cash back one that does not have any insurance for this…

Is there some kind of default compensation I can get from an airline or airport if my baggage is lost or if my flight is cancelled/delayed and I end up losing money from my pre booked airbnb and having to pay for other expenses?

Another question could be, can I ask the airline to re-charge me or MOVE the charge to another credit card that has insurance for this?

I guess the last scenario would be asking my bank to switch the charge to another card because of my stupid mistake since both credit cards are from the same bank. 

Both CC are Visa’s but I doubt Visa has anything to do with this so I wouldn’t bother contacting VISA.

My thought process here is business class tickets for my dates are around 155K miles. So I could essentially cover the cost of one ticket and buy the other using Chase sapphire points as a 1:1 transfer. 

I could be looking at this wrong but would love any insight/feedback from the community.

So I've got 30kg of hold luggage allowance. I'm only bringing a bag which will fit in the cabin. If my bag ends up being a few kg more than the allowance of 7kg, I can see on their website that there will be an additional fee of $70 per kg (from the location I'm flying from).

I also read online that if the cabin bag is too heavy they will put a tag on it and put it in the hold. 

Now, as I haven't used any of the 30kg allowance for the hold luggage. Will I still be charged $70 per kg if it is over? Or will they just put my bag in the hold for free, as I've got 30kg allowance anyway?

Of course, i'll aim to keep it under 7kg but I am picking up a few bits of tech (laptop/camera) and I'm unsure of the weight right now.

I'm getting married this year! Wooooo! And my wife-to-be and I together have decided that we want to have a traditional honeymoon. Where we go somewhere, do nothing, eat and drink a lot, because frankly, we haven't taken a vacation together since we began dating 5 years ago, and neither of us have taking any vacation since we were in high school. 

However we are having a hard time finding trips that aren't going to break our bank, and I'll be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing. We want to go right after the wedding, in the end of July, but August would also be cool. So maybe another time of year might be cheaper?

We will also be flying out of Canada. From what I've heard, Canada is stupid expensive to fly out of...but really it's our only choice. Toronto, London or maaaybe Montreal? Once again...never done this.

And maybe we shy away from the all inclusive Caribbean resorts? It seems like the easy option, but perhaps there's cheaper options?

I’m (19F) planning to travel abroad to learn Spanish this summer in July/August and was looking to get feedback or advice from anyone who’s done so before. I’m based in Ireland so thinking of the Canary Islands or mainland Spain rather than Central America. I’m looking to do intensive lessons as I don’t have any Spanish so like 20 lessons a week plus maybe 5 or 10 individual ones as that’s what these programs seem to offer. What is the best route to go with accommodation? Should I use the company or arrange private accommodation? I have two colleagues in work that are from Fuerteventura and Barcelona so could probably help me find legitimate accommodation there if anyone has experience with good language schools there. Otherwise, what are the red flags for a school? Green flags? I’m particularly interested in learning hospitality related vocab as that’s the industry I currently work in. I don’t drive so city living is better, does anyone who’s lived in the canaries know how feasible it is to cycle? I’ve only visited on holidays.

I posted on here awhile back about a trip to Japan &amp; after seeing everyone’s advice (which was all GREAT advice), I went to my partner and his buddy and discovered our plans had drastically changed. His buddy ended up needing to drop out from work stuff &amp; my partner and I saw that many people mentioned how cold it would be in Japan during that time. We didn’t want to get snowed in or not get the full experience, so we switched our destination to Thailand. 

That being said, we will be in Thailand for ten days. We are flying into Chiang Mai. Since everyone gave such awesome feedback about Japan, I figured I’d come here to game plan for Thailand (granted, our trip starts on the 8th of February-so my planning has been super bad). 

Our goals for the trip include: climbing spots (I love top rope climbing and would love to climb places over there… my partner doesn’t climb, so we would need to rent him equipment and would need a belayer for me since he doesn’t know how), temples to visit, places to hike, beaches to explore and relax on, and lots of food! It would also be cool to be able to see elephants. My partner also wants a bit of a culture shock for at least some of the trip. I’ve never been to Thailand, so I’m unsure of what to expect. 

Any and all advice would be wonderful! Our trip starts with us flying into Chiang Mai and ends with us needing to leave from Chiang Mai, but we are flexible with where we should stay in between. We haven’t booked any lodging yet, only flights.

I suspect it's because the trip I'm doing contains a 'detour' (BUD-DXB-LAX). Yes, there's a reason it has to be that way.

I've heard that it's beneficial to book everything on the same ticket for the better management of delays, cancellations, etc. But since there's no way for me to do this other than on two separate bookings, how much am I risking here? Keep in mind, both flights are on the same airline.

I learned same thing hard way. Now hear most of us out before we get scolded for using priceline. 

Priceline has advertisement like they the Apple of travel, when they are the SPIRIT Airlines of Travel. They take your money up front and will not give you jack back and will fight you tooth and nail. They prob spend big dollars on ads too.

booked a flight hotel and car package. was cheapest price around. Hours later i learned about Autoslash. tracked my rental and within one day the price was down $100 on rental.  So I cancelled the Car rental part. I got my confirmation email of cancel and refund on the way. Rental dropped another $100 a week later.

After 7 business days no refund. Call Priceline told to wait for escalations to get back to me within 5 business days. they pass and i have to call them and be transferred to escalations. was told my rental was non refundable blah blah. explain to him not what email said nor website. He checks his system and sees the refund notice sent. given a case number and told to wait for account specialist. email 7bussiness days later from account person asking for screenshot. promptly sent screenshot and havnt heard anything back for 12bussiness days

\- Comfort: $83 per person/journey (so $166 for a round trip) includes ""Meals and drinks"" and one checked bag (23 kg)

TravelHacks,"Hi,

Last December, me and my wife decided to take a trip to Budapest, Vienna and Prague. We rented a car from Enterprise Hungary. Even though I had picked an hatchback car on online reservation, they upgraded it to a station wagon brand new car, which was 8 months old. It was a 10 day rent, and at the final day I got hit by a rock at autobahn and windshield got cracked. It was rather a minor crack (at least from my perspective it was), but the company decided to change the windshield altogether since the car was new. They told me that the new cars are treated this way for the upcoming auctions. Apart from the windshield, I have also paid for labor fee, taxes, windshield protector and so on that totaled up to around 1200 euros, which was way way over the price I had paid for the car. They also said that the damage on the windshield was in front of the driver's view which is not allowed in traffic following the Hungarian traffic rules and I do not know how much of an effect the little crack would have. I just really regret renting the car due to this damage fee.

I know that wifi coverage will be nonexistent in places, like West Virginia for example in the mountains, but I'm interested in riding from a stop in Northern Virginia out to Chicago for a work conference in a few months.

I work a fully remote job and don't have meetings or anything like that I have to take, so I was envisioning a leisurely, scenic train ride where I'd leave on a Wednesday and arrive Thursday night for the weekend. I don't need much connection, though if I'm going to be traveling during the week, I need at least a few hours a day where I can browse the internet (I'm a writer, so I just need access to email, articles online, and Google docs). I have end of day deadlines for having content written, but I have a co-writer who can fill in the gaps, so things aren't totally dependent on me if I hit a spot without internet for, say, two hours.

I don't love flying, and in a way this sounds less stressful and possibly even productive for me, but that rides on the assumption that I can meaningfully access wifi on the ride.

TravelHacks,"Just an FYI. I rented a car from Avis in Florida this past November and returned it on the 12th. The car was a bit on the rougher side for a rental but given how busy it was I didn’t care. I took pics and vids of all the minor scuffs and scrapes. Also notified an employee of a small chip in the windshield, he said it was fine.

Anyways today I get a letter from Avis that was basically two lines long saying I was going to be charged $514 for glass repair. I sent an email to the address in the letter simply asking for any and all documentation related to the claim and I would require it before my credit card is charged. I received a response stating that your photos aren’t taking of minor damage and that the vehicle was removed from service for repairs. I then sent an email stating that their response was fine but I would need some type of bill or receipt to indicate what the $514 was paying for because right now all I have is two lines out of the blue saying I owe $514. Avis then emails back and says that their sorry for thr inconvenience and that they’re are closing the claim without charging my card

My point is, not that it’s a new thought, but take detailed photos of your rental and keep them for a LONG time.

Also is anything above normal? I barely gave any pushback and they immediate dropped it, almost like they send these letters out and just hope nobody follows up on it. I would have thought that at the time of Avis discovering the damage (if there even was any) they would contact me at some point before just deciding I was at fault and owed them money",Avis sent letter stating I owed for damage,,Squishy321,,0,2023-01-12 09:12:24

TravelHacks," Hello, I hope you are all doing well

I have asked around and after feeling like I am at my last option, I am here asking for some advice and/or help. I am in need of finding affordable airline tickets as soon as possible so I can start my new job (will explain more).

Maybe this is the wrong subreddit to post in, but you guys have the best advice on traveling so I figured it couldn't hurt to ask here. If this is not the place to ask, mods please remove this posts.

TLDR at the bottom:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22M, Korean-Chilean, recently finished college in the US, and went directly to Seoul as I haven't seen my family in 5 years so I wanted to spend some time with them before I go off to work. While in the US, I was searching for jobs and I got a job in Spain to work as a mechanical engineer which I signed the contract for. The only thing is that took a long time was getting the Visa to go work there but after weeks of talking to the company and the embassy I am nearly almost ready to get it.

**The problem is:** I had planned to go to Spain directly from Korea before I had arrived here, planning on getting the Visa here since the manager of the company who was helping me had told me I could do it from Korea, but it turns out he was wrong. I gave up my Korean citizenship a few years ago and I am not a permanent resident here so the Spanish embassy told me yesterday when I went for my interview that I would have to get my Visa in Chile.

I do not currently have the financial capability to purchase a ticket to Santiago from Seoul as they are around 1100USD atm and I had spent the majority of my saved up money on skin cancer treatment here (I am 100% okay now, but can show proof and treatment to mods if relevant). I cannot really rely on my family as my dad's business just went bankrupt and I've tried but I cannot legally work for any sort of cash here since I am not a citizen/permanent resident. I had already bought a ticket from Incheon to Madrid before arriving here leaving in 7 days, which I'll have to call the airline and hope they will change it and help me out.

Making it a little more tricky, due to me not being a Korean citizen, I only have 9 more days I can stay in the country before I have to go out. I tried to plan out everything before I came to Korea, but with my dad's business going broke, the passing of my grandmother, and me needing medical treatment everything went out of plan and I do not know what to do. I feel so helpless because once I get my Visa and arrive to Spain and start working, I will have money, but until then I feel so powerless.

**What I need:** just some advice. If you have ever been in a situation like this, what should I do? or rather what CAN I do? Do you know anyone that had a similar experience and if yes, what happened? I don't want to ask for money as that feels kind of scummy, especially since I don't know any of you, but is there any sort of organization that can help someone in my situation? I've tried looking at all the websites and YouTube tricks for cheaper flights but the cheapest I have found after hours of research is 1050USD for a one-way ticket. If there is any sites or codes or something that can help me, I would be so SO grateful.

TravelHacks,"Hey all!  


I'm (24M) super excited to be going to Australia from Mid Feb to Mid March. Works out that I'll be there for 3.5 weeks with my partner - we'll be heading to Sydney for the majority for World Pride, but also heading up to Byron Bay for a few days in the middle. General consensus is that accommodation is entirely sorted between my partners friends and family, but I'm very aware that aus (particularly Sydney) is spenny for everything else so want to get myself set up.  


I was going to take cash, but my partner seems to think Card is the way forward - would love a second opinion on that.  
In addition, a rough idea of budget - we'll be going to a lot of different events, dinners, parties etc. along with pride itself so expecting a good share to go on alcohol in particular as well as food.

I was also only in high school at the time so I don’t really remember how customs worked (I realize it will probably vary depending on airport and country).

Can somebody who is familiar with international travel (especially these particular airports) please walk me through this process and explain how they manage very short layovers? I’ve added the airports that I have layovers in below for reference. Any tips would be much appreciated!

TravelHacks,"When you book a flight or a hotel through a third party like Kayak, Priceline, or Booking.com, there will be many restrictions on your flight or hotel stay:

1. You do not receive loyalty points or miles that you can use to redeem additional flights or hotel nights. Using points to book flights/hotels can give you extremely good value (i.e. [you can stay a whole month at Hilton Bali with just 90k Hilton points](https://suitesmile.com/blog/2019/11/16/review-staying-in-hilton-garden-inn-bali-for-80-nights-with-only-240000-points/))

2. You do not receive status qualifying miles and nights to earn elite status on airlines or hotel chains (such as Marriott Platinum or Delta Gold. This can give you numerous benefits such as room and seat class upgrades.

3. If something goes wrong (i.e. airline or hotel loses your reservation), which happens OFTEN when booking though third parties, you need to negotiate with the third party to fix the issue, instead of directly with the hotel or airline. This is a pain in the ass, and something like this could badly screw up your entire trip. Hotels and airlines always give priority to reservations made directly with them, since they didn't have to pay a commission fee to the third parties.

When accounting for the points/miles not earned, the rates on these third party sites are RARELY CHEAPER than booking directly, especially if you already have status with the hotel or airline you’re booking with.

——————————————————

So what’s wrong with chrome extensions like TravelArrow? They promise to save the customer money by redirecting them to these third party sites. The creators/owners of these extensions are paid by Kayak, Skyscanner, Priceline, etc. whenever you use the extension to redirect to their sites, because it gets their websites more clicks, which means there will be more people booking with them. They are essentially a platform for advertising these third party sites TO YOU.

I singled out TravelArrow specifically because they create extremely cringe TikToks to promote their extension. In [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRghg6nj/), they show that their extension found a flight on Skyscanner for $800 cheaper (lmao), but what they don’t mention is that the flight they found had an extra layover and was 7 hours longer.

[Here is the founder admitting that his goal is to eventually get acquired by one of one of the third party travel booking giants.](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRghDVrT/)","Do NOT use TravelArrow, PlanMoreTrips, or any third party chrome extension that promises lower rates on flights/hotels.

TravelHacks,"Hi,

I'm currently in the process of trying to plan travel to SE Asia between the months of July and August, and was looking for an opportune layover to see an additional place. I was looking at flights from either DC or JFK to Singapore (where I plan to start my travel), and saw a good price for a flight to Singapore from JFK that connects through Tokyo, which is somewhere I'd love to spend a day or two in as I've never been just to experience the city, but the layover is only 6 hours. Overall, booking two separate tickets 3 days later would increase the total JFK - Singapore journey from $584 to roughly $850.  I'm pretty young and most of my travel has been around Europe from Europe, so no real use in trying to get an advantageous layover. But this is new to me, and I was wondering if anyone had advice on finding a layover that wouldn't be $275 more than the flights booked together.

1. We are vegetarian, so adding a lot of vegan places.
2. My wife has mobility issues/crutches as she had hip surgery, so trying to find places that are accessible.
3. I want to do maximum activities, but due to my wife’s recent surgery, I am trying to have a chill looking around.

Essentially looking to see (a) if we can do things better moving things around (b) did we miss something big (c) my wife Vs my idea of a perfect day trip- where Reddit users will decide what we do with our day, see 30th Jan for more info

24 January, first day:

• Arrive at Haneda at 7.35 am

• Collect pocket WIFI and 72-hour metro ticket (I don’t think I need Suica as I can simply get a 72-hour ticket, surely that will be better, right?)

• Going to Hotel in Shinjuku where we will be based.

• A quick visit to Tokyo Metropolitan Government building sightseeing tower

• Lunch at CoCo Ichibanya

• Visiting Shinjuku Gyoen

• Visit Seikido (stationary shop) + Takashimaya Shinjuku

• Dinner in one of the places in Takashimaya Shinjuku

• Time to sleep

•

25 January:

• Morning visit Meiji Jingu temple (Harajuku)

• Visit Takeshita Street (any vegan crapes places?)

• Get to Shibuya

• Shibuya scramble crossing (because it needs to be done)

• Shibhuya Sky building (amazing views)

• Visit the kitkat store in Shibuya (google says it closed down but YouTube went there one month ago so not sure if it is open)

• Photo with Hachiko

• If you have any more ideas for the day, please let me know credit users.

26 January:

• Breakfast and train to Yokohama

• Visiting cup noodles in Yokohama (I love cup noodles)

• Visit Yamashita Park in Yokohama

• Visit Redbrick Warehouse

• Train back to Shinjuku

• Back at the hotel and rest.

• Redditt users, I think I can do 1 thing more on this day may be trip to Giza?

27 January:

• Disneyland Tokyo

• Hotel and rest

• Lunch at Afuri, Shinjuku

• Visit Ginza and see Muji store

• Eating dinner at Ginza

29 January:

• Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden traditional tea room

• Back to Ginza visiting Kimuraya Bakery (check egg less bread)

• Ginza Corridor street

• Ginza Kabukiza theatre view from outside only

• Watch a movie

(Redditt users, we both love watching the usual Hollywood movies in cinemas abroad; We can find one in Ginza or one where we will be living in Shinjuku. Any recommendation for a decent modern cinema for the movie?). In uk we have Odeon and vue in our city so we go for one where we can find reclining seats and is modern.

30 January:

MY PLAN: not approved by my wife

• Train from Tokyo to Osaka in AM

• Visiting Nintendo world which is my dream

• Visiting Dotombori and checking the Glico running man

• Train back to Tokyo/Shinjuku

My wife’s alternative plan (I am not on board with this)

• Spending time in Tokyo districts

• Visiting central Tokyo Imperial Palace Grounds

• Visit central Tokyo station

• Visit Shin-maruouchi (the shopping mall)

• Visit Ryogoku Station

• Try to watch a sumo wrestling match (Reddit users, do we need to buy this in advance?)

Redditt users: Both my wife and I will be waiting for your reply are you on my side or my wife’s side Osaka or Not? 6 hours is a lot, and I am mindful, but it is once in a lifetime trip.

31 January:

Visiting Roppongi and Akasaka

• Visit Harry Porter Café (Japan, 〒107-0052 Tokyo, Minato City, Akasaka, 5 Chome−3−1 BIZタワ 1F)

• Visiting Tokyo Tower

• Visit Toyokawa Inari shrine

• Dinner back at Shinjuku at Ryo No Myako Inshokug(Shinjuku amazing street food style place)

1 February (keeping it a relaxed day):

• Pack items ahead of the morning flight the next day

• Reddit users very open to suggestions for this day

• Go to Akihabara and visit the Yobachi Camera

• Visit the owl café (Akiba furou)

• Take the metro to any place/district that we loved the most in our trip.

2 February travel back:

TravelHacks,"I have been a road warrior in the past but took some time off from business traveling with the rest of the world and now my travel plans are again increasing.  

Here's the trouble, when the world changed, so did I.  I went from 60+ hours a week, traveling 50% of the time.  Pretty much surviving on take out, whether traveling or home.  Covid hits, I got a new job that's barely 40 hours and zero travel due to covid. We stopped eating out almost completely! My spouse and I have never been in better shape, nor have we ever felt better physically! 

A few months ago I had a 2 week trip to Prague.  For those not familiar with the local cuisine, it's similar to German, very heavy, fried, comfort food.  I LOVED it, for like the first 4 days.  Then I felt bloated and overall like poop. 

Here's the question.  What food tips do you recommend? I have some medical issues that make small meals preferable, also later in the day is better.  I also usually don't have a kitchen.  

I'm headed back to Prague soon for a couple weeks again.  Last time, I ended up wandering around a grocery store and grabbed random snacks such as nuts, croissants, fresh fruit.   But I haven't figured out proteins, this was extra difficult as everything was in czech.  I get nervous around meats, if I don't know what it is, not sure if it needs to be heated or if it's safe to eat cold etc.    Salads are hit or miss, had a random fish on one I want expecting lol 

So any go to easy hotel room meals that you turn to when you are done enjoying the local restaurants and you can't stomach what's on the menu for room service?

TravelHacks,"Hi,

Can anyone recommend the best site or app to notify me of price fluctuations for a given itinerary?

I tried 2 from the App Store yesterday and the prices are vastly different, which makes me concerned that they are not “seeing” all the available flights.

There is also not enough granularity in the alert capabilities.  I would like to be alerted if the price drops but the travel date for one leg might need to be changed, etc.  One had the ability for +/- 1 day on the return flight but not the outbound flight, which was puzzling.

Also, are any of the paid travel deals sites worth it for a specific trip with fixed dates?  Or are they mostly beneficial for spontaneous trips when an unexpected deal arises?

Appreciate any help or information from the group.

Im a little more well traveled than her and personally, I don’t have anywhere I want to travel to or see on the east coast (that I haven’t seen already) so I’m just looking for some suggestions and inspiration on how to shake things up a bit so I’m not bored and get something out of this trip too.

Pre-pandemic I would  take any ticket 450€ or less to any city on another continent (not Europe) that appealed to me. Osaka, Bangkok, Seoul, Delhi, Costa Rica were all places I went to for cheap. Sadly since the pandemic there are no cheap tickets to be had. Boo!

TravelHacks,"I’m planning a 2.5 week long trip to Europe from Feb 22- Mar 10 (tentative dates).

I was originally planning to visit Greece(Athens, Santorini, Crete), Italy (Rome, Florence, Venice) and Spain (Madrid, Barcelona). But I’m now reconsidering Greece because of the closures during winter in the islands. I’d like suggestions on what I can change in this trip, maybe potentially do Croatia instead of Greece? Would love feedback from people who have visited these countries in late Feb, early March time.

TravelHacks,"My husband and I live in Iowa and are going to a wedding in Alabama in February. Because of the area we live in and the area the wedding is in, the easiest way to fly would be through small airports but the trip would be close to $2000 if we used those airports. We have decided to drive and fly out of Chicago and land in New Orleans (which is about a quarter of the cost), then get a rental car and drive to the wedding location. But rental cars are so high right now! Would it possibly be cheaper to not rent a car but take a taxi instead? It would be a 2 hour drive there and a 2 hour drive back. Advice? Currently with the cheapest flights and rental car I can find, the trip will still run about $700.",How to make a trip more affordable?,,kdjdurbrbksskoerjrh,,0,2023-01-06 17:11:42
TravelHacks,"So I decided I wanted to get from A to B via X. I know there are options, several ones in fact. The issue is (I'm a noob traveller, so bear with me pls) I can't seem to find a site that lets me 'force' the transfer airport X, which is crucial to my plan, because I want to try a specific airline/plane combo. Either they offer me another city (and it's true that those are the more sensible options money-wise) or if I choose multi-city, there's always the problem of the dates. Also I realise multi-city is not for my use case, but I gave it a try anyway.

My question to the more seasoned among you guys: is my only option to try specific airlines' websites and book both flight legs separately or do you know a search engine that lets me decide where I change planes and maybe book the whole thing on one ticket? I'm assuming the latter is better, IF possible.","I have a plan, but I don't know how to search flights for it",,IllustriousBrief8827,,0,2023-01-06 16:36:19

What vaccinations/ jabs do we need currently thinking typhoid , Hep A and rabies -  

-recommended travel cards?- atm I’m thinking Starling 

- will we need visas ? we will be in Thailand less than 30 days straight however it may be more than 30 days accumulated as we may spend 25 days at the beginning and 10 days at the end in Thailand for example ? We will also be visiting Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia during the 10 weeks 

- drinking water - I’ve heard some people say they boil the tap water , some take tablets or filtration systems  - I was planning to just drink bottled water- what would you all recommend 

- in terms of travelling place to place we were thinking long busses and trains prominently maybe with flights from Laos to Vietnam as I heard travelling from capital of Laos to northern Vietnam is a long boring journey . - what would you all recommend 

Best way to do SIM cards ???

- any sure fire insurance companies ? 

- finally very open to any tips / hacks / things to look out for /  or suggestions be it bags , towels , travel adapters , suncream , insect repellant  etc .

I’m a young man (21) looking to travel to a new country for some refreshment along with a lot of other reasons.

I have had my head set on doing it from a kid and now I feel it’s time to go ahead and test the water. 

I have travelled around a fair bit considering my town is known for keeping the crowd. I would like any advice or tips you can offer on Thailand.

Where is a good spot to travel? 

What’s the daily spending limit I should apply and how easily will I be able to do that?

Is a provisional needed for motorbikes?

TravelHacks,"Many visitors to Lhasa need the essentials for their journey. It would help if you packed seasonally suitable apparel and equipment for your trip. Seasonal changes in the capital city's weather mean you'll need to pack differently depending on when you visit.

# Legal Receipts for Air Travel

You will be allowed to leave the country with your papers, so remember to bring them. So, you'll need to pack them first. And store them somewhere you can get to them quickly if you need to manufacture them quickly.

You will only be allowed to enter the territory if you have the proper documentation for [Tibet](https://peregrinetreks.com/nepal-tibet-and-bhutan-tour), including a passport and a **Chinese Entry visa**. The **Tibet Travel Permission** is the most critical permit for entering Tibet and will be secured by your travel agency before your trip to Lhasa. Please send us scans of your passport and visa when you book your trip with us, and we'll get your Tibet Travel Permit. After your Tibet travel permit has been issued, we will send it to your hotel in China so you can be ready for your journey.

# Clothes

Could you remember the time of year and your destination when packing for a trip to the plateau? Though it is a monsoon-affected area, Tibet does experience the full range of four distinct seasons, making it much simpler for many Western visitors to prepare appropriately for their trip.

Warm and comfortable gear is a must if you want to hike in and around Lhasa in the spring. It would help if you still packed warm trousers, not jeans, and a warm fleece jacket, sweater, or pullover. Even while certain areas may feel warmer than others, having gloves, a hat, and a scarf on hand is always a good idea. Also, don't forget your shades and a good hat — the sun in Tibet is intense.

There is less need to pack bulky sweaters and coats throughout the summer, but a fleece is recommended for the cooler evenings. Cotton shirts are the most practical and pleasant option during the warmer months. Further, pants with less bulk make it simpler to go about. Wearing protective eyewear and a hat outside is essential, as is packing a raincoat and maybe an umbrella for the summer rainfall.

Dressing for the weather in autumn is similar to dressing in spring, although warmer. You should dress in layers; the fleece will come in handy on the chillier evenings. Light clothes are OK, but heavier hiking pants should be packed for a journey to Lake Namtso.

Even during the day, you'll want to bundle up in a fleece or chunky sweater this winter. At night, you'll want a thick down or quilted jacket, and during the day, you'll want to make sure you have warm gloves and a cap. Protective eyewear, such as sunglasses, is essential due to the intense sunshine, and thermal underwear will come in handy.

Good, sturdy boots are a year-round must, whether or not you intend to go hiking. Since the terrain is often unforgiving, a good pair of hiking boots is essential. And please include a pair of comfy shoes for the automobile and the hotel rooms.

# Medicines

Non-Chinese inhabitants will need help with obtaining medications on the plateau. If you acquire a headache in Tibet, you may not be able to locate even the most basic pain relievers, so be sure to pack accordingly. Medications used to treat headaches, nausea, and vertigo may help reduce the effects of altitude sickness.

For any ongoing medical issues, pack enough of your regular medicine to last the duration of your trip. You should bring enough of your prescription medications to last your trip, plus one additional week just in case you need to see a hospital while in China.

# Preventative Medication and Skin Cream

Contrary to popular belief, the Tibetan plateau is neither icy nor unfriendly. The sun may be as intense on the plateau as in the tropics of Asia. Due to the thinner atmosphere, sunburns are possible even in the winter in Lhasa. Packing sunblock with the highest SPF possible is a must in Lhasa at any time of the year.

Also, the winds may be brisk and ferocious. Bringing skin moisturizers and lip balm to Lhasa is a brilliant idea to prevent your face, hands, and lips from becoming chapped while seeing the city. The sun's UVB rays are more damaging than the sun's UVA rays. Therefore it's crucial to have a good hat to protect your head from the sun and your face.

# Cards and Money

Despite China's flourishing cashless payment sector, most purchases on the plateau still require physical currency. Tibet has yet to see the full benefits of this trend. Most stores and vendors will only accept cash payments. And using native money.

The Rénmnb (RMB), commonly known as the yuan (CNY - ), is the official currency of Tibet. Any central banks in Lhasa, including the Bank of China, will allow you to exchange your dollars or other primary foreign currency for yuan. If you need to convert currency, you'll find that many five-star hotels provide currency exchange services, often at the same rate as local banks. If you want to return to the Bank of China in Lhasa to convert money, hold on to your receipts. – Find out how to make purchases and utilize currency in Tibet.

Although big hotels in Lhasa are more likely to take credit cards, you will only find a few places to use them elsewhere. Credit card acceptance is limited even for significant purchases, and the few stores that take them sometimes tack on a 4% extra. Only the Bank of China branch in Lhasa allows customers to withdraw cash against their credit cards, and they charge a fee of 3%.

These days, ATMs are conveniently placed around Lhasa. You may use any major credit card at any ATM in China, but your best bet is to use a Bank of China ATM since they accept VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, Maestro, Cirrus, and. However, before using an ATM, you should find out whether it accepts your card. The highest amount can be withdrawn from an ATM transaction is 2,400 yuan. However, there is no restriction on how much can be withdrawn in a single day. Your card's spending limit is determined solely by the terms you've agreed to with your financial institution.

# Helpful Technology We Use Every Day

Today's world relies heavily on electronic gadgets, so it's essential to always have a working charger on hand for anything from cell phones and portable power banks to cameras, computers, and netbooks. As an added precaution, it's a good idea to have extra batteries for your most frequently used electronics in case they die before you get back to the hotel.

A small daypack or purse is recommended so you won't have to lug about your big luggage while visiting places like monasteries or other tourist attractions. And remember to include a water bottle so you can stay hydrated on your travels.

# Conclusion

It's easy to prepare for the Lhasa trip by packing. Knowing what to pack is essential, particularly if you plan to visit Tibet outside the regular tourist season. The essential component of vacation preparation is ensuring you have everything you'll need, including appropriate clothing and enough valuable equipment.

TravelHacks,"Inspired by my own personal hell when dealing with Frontier these past couple years, I spent a good chunk of 2022 reading dozens of increasingly similar accounts of how Frontier's evolving anti-consumer practices have ruined/soured so many travelers' trips. This trend will likely only get worse in 2023, so I've decided to compile a list of the most absurd but common nonsense that myself and others have encountered with this budget airline, and some surprisingly easy options Americans have to avoid dealing with their lack of customer service, ridiculous fees, and no-refunds BS.

Flying Frontier can be okay, but as soon as something goes wrong (on their end)  prepare for a mess of infuriating gotchas, gross incompetence, and vacation-ruining time wasters. It's so bad that I cannot recommend Frontier to anyone but the most savvy, careful, or last-minute flyers. 

***Skip to rule #10 if you want a tl;dr for the most important piece of advice I have for when things do go wrong that I'm amazed is rarely mentioned on this sub.*** 

\------**PART 1: 10 RULES TO NOT GET F\*CKED FLYING FRONTIER----**\--

These rules/warnings are in mostly ascending priority since they tend to build on one another, but feel free to skip around:

1. **Triple check the carry-on/backpack dimensions** and then subtract 1"" on each edge. Do you need to apply the slightest force to compress the bag into the little metal cubes they have at the gates to check its size? Good luck, they have been increasingly slapping some travelers with the \~$100 oversized bag fee even though their backpack can easily compress into the cube, and can certainly fit under the seat. 
2. **Do not expect them to re-book you if your flight is cancelled.** Be aware of last minute flight prices, and never book a frontier flight when you know last minute flights can be 4-6x more than a regular airline, because in most cases Frontier will not eat the loss to rebook you. There are so many reports of them sticking people in shitty hotels for days to avoid a prompt but expensive rebook, and even stories of subsequent rebookings for an initially canceled flight! Dollar cost average that shit, it's often cheaper in the long run to pay a bit more for the non-budget airline where you're covered in the event of a cancellation, than have frontier pull a fast one on you and you're effectively out an extra $1k for a last-minute booking out of pocket, or worse--losing days of your planned trip upset and stuck in an airport/hotel.
3. **The 1-in-25 flight cancellation average is misleading, plan ahead.** Sure, you can rationalize that 1/25 flights are cancelled on average over the year, but the distribution of canceled flights is not a fair dice role. If you're flying during busy travel days, holidays, or notable weather events the odds that **your** particular flight is cancelled can be much higher than that 1/25 average. And you guessed it, these are the types of situations where last minute flights tend to be much more expensive than usual too! Not only are you more likely to have to book last minute due to a cancellation, you're forced to pay much more too--double whammy 
4. **Never expect to reach a live  support person unless you are physically at the terminal**. You cannot reach a real person over the phone (I've tried over six times for 2+ hours on hold and got through once), and chat is outsourced to southeast asia and they are unable to process refunds/reimbursements (as is regular phone support), and 8/10 times chat either went completely afk or ended chat abruptly. I haven't personally confirmed this, but I've read on this sub that some frontier staff charge a $25 fee to have them help you with rebookings/changes at the airport!? Ironically, the one time I got to reach real frontier staff at an airline I was told that even they cannot process refunds or reimbursements and to try calling in! As of writing, I believe Frontier is the only American budget airline company to claim they are going chat-only support, but we'll see..
5. **Travel voucher credit is often worthless**. This is not southwest, you are heavily restricted in how you may use your voucher credit. New credit now typically expires in 90 days, must be in your name, is only usable on initial bookings, and is almost always subject to their absurd $50-$100 cancellation fees. There's also a weird scam going around where some people have had [their flight credit mysteriously used up](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/frontier-airlines-frontier-miles-program/2094123-i-victim-flight-credit-fraud.html#post34657766) by someone 1-2 days before it expires that is its own rabbit hole I have spent hours trying to decipher. If you accept the voucher and are unable to use it in time, you can kiss a real cash refund goodbye in most cases. (SEE RULE # 10)  
Despite consumer protections guaranteeing you a right to a refund with most unexpected cancellations, Frontier offers vouchers as ""easy"", immediate alternatives to those not willing to go through the process of requesting a refund through Frontier--wait on hold for several hours and filling out a silly, in my case BROKEN pdf form for a refund request that must be manually submitted and can take weeks to finally clear. 
6. **Don't expect their online systems to work 24/7. Deadlines which incur fees are often effected by glitches/outages, and don't expect to be reimbursed when outages out of your control cost you $$ in additional fines** . For weeks forums and subs were plagued with complaints that voucher redemption systems were broken and travelers lost their credit after trying to use them dozens of times. Some spent HOURS trying to reach a live person, but support were unable to use it on their end, and unable reinstate the credits once they expired, basically telling their customers to eat shit and accept the loss because their systems had some bug. **This is absolutely unacceptable when you consider that vouchers are often pitched as a store-credit like alternative to those owed a refund**. One good example of system outages costing money is the cancellation/rebook functionality randomly failing for days at a time or certain flight numbers--forcing users to pay the \~$100 cancellation fee if they are unable to cancel the same business day they booked, making it more infuriating as you're wasting hours refreshing/retrying the site over and over + have multiple chats open + have two phones on hold desperately trying to reach a person before the clock counts down your $100 loss. Regular support staff cannot just reimburse you if ""the system"" is acting up and time passes, and if the system is down for you it tends to be down on their end too... Good luck
7. **Never expect a free cancellation/rescheduling even if you plan ahead, expect to pay $50-$100**. On paper, Frontier claims that cancellations are free within 24 hours and rebookings charge no extra fees if done 60+ days prior.  But, there are all sorts of reports of the fee being charged for cancellations made the next day, even if was within 24 hours of booking. Combine this with the notorious downtime/errors on their site, and it becomes comically difficult to cancel in time. I've booked a flight at the end of the day, had their site/service go down for the remainder of the night, canceled in the morning, and still been hit with a $100 fee. *If you book a flight that departs in less than 7 days, you will be hit with the $100 cancellation fee no matter what. Even if you try to cancel it immediately, it was officially considered too close to the real flight to be eligible for free cancellations the second you booked it* 
8. **Don't check a bag unless you don't mind it being lost** Yes this applies to all airlines, and yes there is insurance, but the combo of being unable to reach a live person at Frontier combined with their absurd stinginess in refunds/reimbursements makes losing your bag particularly bad. It's genuinely not worth the time to try to do anything if your bag doesn't make it. 
9. **Your carry-on is not always safe, you may be forced to check it anyway.** Often travelers are aware of the lost bag problem, so they pack their expensive/irreplaceable items in their carry-on to make sure it arrives at their destination with them.  Well, it's fairly often that bins fill up and the passengers in later boarding groups are forced to check their bags at the gate when they finally call them to board. These unexpected [forced carry-on checkings can and do go missing](https://www.businessinsider.com/british-airways-checked-in-bag-then-got-lost-2022-12) all the time, so be prepared to work something out or straightup refuse to board if you're carrying irreplaceable items in your carry-on and they tell you it needs to be checked. In some instances, the logistics of a last-minute bag checked at the gate make it more likely to be lost, especially if you have a connecting flight. Plan ahead and consider paying a tad more to board early and secure some overhead space, as it's never worth risking a last-minute forcibly checked bag if you've got something irreplaceable or very expensive you would never have checked in the first place. 

If you've somehow made it this far, stick around for Rule #10. It has served me so well that in my opinion, it can make flying Frontier worth it... sometimes

#         10. ALWAYS book with an Amex credit card, do NOT waste your time contacting support and jumping through hoops for a refund, NEVER ACCEPT A VOUCHER WHEN YOU ARE OWED A REFUND

Kind of a mouthful, I know, but following rule #10 will make frontier a breeze and even negates you having to worry about several of the previous rules. Simply put, whenever something goes wrong that should warrant a refund, you do not need to waste hours trying to reach a real person at Frontier only to be told they can't do refunds and offer you some 90-day nonsense voucher if you complain hard enough. Instead fill out a claim to contest the charge through amex's website/app. The process takes two minutes on your phone--uploading docs and lengthy explanations are typically **not** needed. While it may take a couple weeks for the refund to appear on your account, kick back and relax as Amex handles dealing with Frontier's absurd refund paperwork for you. You do not need a paid amex card either, every $0 fee amex card has this perk. 

**Why Amex?** Amex has a notoriously consumer-friendly process to contest charges, sides with their cardholders far more often than the competition, and has a streamlined process specifically tailored for their cardholders to request refunds for failed travel expenses(all major airline companies/rental companies included). Businesses and frequent flyers alike are aware that Amex works directly with airlines for these ""contested charges"" , to the point that some in the know will not even bother contacting southwest/united for refunds these days, and instead go straight to Amex to save time, headache, and most importantly demand a real refund instead of flight voucher credit. 

**Why not contact Frontier and take a voucher?** Frontier has so much fine print around voucher expiration and redemption rules that it is a laughable substitute for a refund. (See Rule #5). If a flight is canceled and they do not make reasonable accommodations for you, which has been the case over and over again on budget travel subs, there are federal protections in place that give you the right to a refund, and your cardholder certainly agrees. But, Frontier is free to offer you an alternative to a refund--the easy and convenient travel voucher! If you waste your hours dealing with Frontier and accept their offer of a travel voucher, and then later you realize you got screwed with an unusable voucher that has expired and you might go try to file a claim with Amex to finally get a proper refund. Unfortunately, it would be too late, as Frontier will actually bother responding with evidence that you came to an agreement with them to accept a flight voucher instead of a refund. **So** **Amex will side with Frontier instead of you and deny the request,** forfeiting both your right to any sort of refund and your time.  So do not play into their voucher offer, do not waste your time agitated while on hold when you should be relaxing, and do not fill out their absurd forms and request callbacks for days in an effort for a refund when Amex is an option. 

&amp;#x200B;

\------**PART 2: Should anyone still fly Frontier when there is any other option available?----**\--

So, if you're armed with an Amex and are not financially constrained by the timing of a  potential chargeback, when is it a good idea to fly Frontier? In my opinion it's perfectly reasonable to fly Frontier when **all** of the following are true for you and your party:

* There are no connecting flights
* You are not checking a bag you care about, or are only traveling with a small backpack
* You are already booking last-minute, or competing last-minute flights in the instance of a last-minute Frontier cancellation are not unreasonably expensive given the risk vs upfront savings
* It's not a busy travel day/holiday/hectic time of the year
* You will not be cancelling or rescheduling your booked flight for any reason
* **The Frontier flight is still considerably cheaper at the end of the day**",FRONTIER AIRLINES - My list of 10 rules to avoid getting screwed when flying with the worst American budget airline in 2023 [warning: long post],,BlastedBrent,,0,2023-01-03 01:08:59

TravelHacks,"Hi
Am an enthusiastic traveller from India loves solo backpacking. So far been to 5 countries inlcuding Singapore , Malaysia , Vietnam , KSA , Nepal within a super low budget. I dont do hitchhiking. Am an active member of couchsurfing as well.
My budget  for every country was less than 400USD including flights from India.

I have always wished to travel to South east asian countries like Thailand , Indonesia , Philippinnes , Hongkong. After my last trip in November 2022 I was confident and relaised that travelling was easy and I can do it with the Indian Passport.

But my girlfriend left to germany back in November 2022 for her higher studies. Its been 3 months without seeing her. I really miss her badly and I want go meet her and spend some time with her maybe a month and explore europe. Besides her I have many friends in France , Netherlands , Italy , Belgium(whom all i met during my trips)This is my goal. With the Indian conditions getting a schengen visa is hard I will have to prove that I am financially capable and rich as well.My only income is from my job and it is 450 USD. I can save 120USD per month for the trip maximum. But I want to go germany as early as possible as I miss her really badly.Before going I will have to quit my job my employer wont allow me take a month holiday.

As per my calculation I will be in need of 2500 USD for a month trip from India including flights,visa and  all.I dont know If i can save 2000 USD within 6 months and visit her. I am travelling to europe not just for leisure.It is for a reason now.But considering the Indian situations it is expensive.

Do you guys have any idea that I can do this as early as possible? Still not sure how to make this much money on a short period of time ( Considering Indian scenario) ? Sometimes travelling is also expensive.

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,

I am looking for cheap flights from HAM -&gt; HND for end march til beginning of april \[yes I know :( pricey season\]. I try to take a look at skyscanner, google flights, etc everyday to notice fluctuation in prices. 

Since yesterday, I noticed that there are sometimes really cheap flights (on skyscanner for example), which I can't even look at if I try to. Skyscanner tries to redirect me to Emirates website but the flight isn't available. \[Screen of the view on skyscanner: [https://imgur.com/a/XVuoymQ](https://imgur.com/a/XVuoymQ)\] The date on which I found this flight was 21.3-6.4.

My question is if this are ""real"" prices and if I am just to slow book them? 1.062€ sounds quiet cheap for me for a round trip with two different airlines (first Emirates then JAL) on the first flight (and only emirates tickets being on 1.500€ for normal relations).

I also tried to look for this combination on solo tickets (like on Emirates: HAM -&gt; DXB -&gt; SIN and then JAL SIN-&gt;HND) but it is way more expensive this way.

Either way those flights seem a bit odd to me (Like also why is it only redirecting me to Emirates if one half of the flight is with JAL? I don't think or know if you are able to book this way)

Long story short: Is it possible that those are real flight offers which just get taken really fast or is it just some miscalculation on skyscanners side?

hey everyone, Im not sure if this is the right sub, but Idk where else to ask. I hope I'm not breaking any rules, I apologize if I am.

I'm a medical student and I frequent home during holidays. Had a close family member pass away a few weeks ago and decided to take a leave of absence from medical school for a semester (after I booked the flights).

I'm supposed to go back to school tmrw, but I would REALLY REALLY REALLY prefer if i could reschedule my flight for the following week to look after the house and dog while my parents go back to asia to sort out some family matters this week.

So my question is: If I intentionally go late tomorrow and make it seem like i barely missed my flight due to traffic, would they reschedule my flight again without a penalty/cost?

I know they mention a penalty, but I've missed my *flight 3 times* in the past (including last week on the way here) and they always rescheduled it without additional charge. When I called to reschedule it this morning in response to the voucher email I got earlier, they offered to charge me ""only"" $80 dollars for an $85 flight next week.

If it matters, the airline is yellow (not gonna name the airline just incase), and At that price difference, I might as well just take my chances that the service agents show me some mercy like they've done in the past? It just sucks knowing that someone else might have been able to take my seat.

looking forward to reading your advice. thanks everyone","Anyone else ""barely"" miss your flight to get rescheduled for free by the customer service agent?",,DonutBoi172,,0,2023-01-01 02:44:59

TravelHacks,"I’ve spent thousands of nights in hotels, mostly for business, occasionally on vacation, plus nefarious reasons according to my profile.

Anyway, right after you get your hotel card, go up to your room. There are several reasons for this.

• It’s no fun to have luggage with you and it’s pitch dark and you can’t find the light switch. Turn on the light empty handed.

• You give a chance for the room to adjust to your preferred temperature while you go back down to the car. I sleep at 55 degrees if I’m alone, 69 if I’m not.

• You get an opportunity to know where to park. Near the elevator or not, near the stairwell or not, near the pool or not, near the lobby or not, whatever is important to you. What’s the closest exit door to my room?

• You get an opportunity to make sure the key works before you do these other steps. About 25% of the time my first key card malfunctions.

• You get to check the room in case anything is seriously wrong. I’ve walked in on a drug deal. I’ve walked in on key 302 that opened room 203. I’ve walked in on sex. I’ve walked in on a blood stained mattress being aired out (suicide that morning). I’ve walked in on a married couple getting a divorce because the three of us had the same last name and she was sick of his cheating. I’ve walked into a Minnesota hotel room at 2am in January and the heater didn’t work.

• You get to see if the room is missing towels, television remote, shampoo, etc.

• If my wife and/or nine year old son might be miserable, I invite them upstairs for their opinions.",Key cards,,gobigred3562,,0,2022-12-30 22:03:19

So I have an issue with Lufthansa. I want to get plane tickets from Germany to Colombia. We are from Bavaria, so flying for Nuremberg would be most comfortable, but the best option offered is through Frankfurt, obviously.

However, if I look up just Frankfurt-Cartagena, the total price of the flight SOARS by a lot, even though you are actually taking one less plane. From what I gather, Lufthansa is just trying to make you fill up these bullshit flights from Nuremberg to Frankfurt.

TravelHacks,"Starting to plan a spring/early summer 4 week trip to Europe for my sabbatical. My husband wants to spend time in his ancestral seat of Scotland, so majority of the trip 10-14 days will be spend touring Scotland by rented campervan (we wish to attend Highland Games and possibly a multi-day canoe trip). The time frame for the trip tentatively looks to be May-June 2024.

However, since I don't want to spend a whole month in one country and I have never been outside the U.S., let alone to Europe, I would like to see some of the places I have dreamt of visiting my entire life (we're in our early-mid 50s). I have several cities and locations on the list and planned on buying a Eurail global multi-day/month pass for flexibility. We're trying to narrow down which cities to visit and have capped it at three. High on my list of places I want to see in my lifetime are Amsterdam (Van Gogh museum; bike culture) and Paris (for too many reasons to list). Also on the list are Munich (Bavaria), Vienna (cafe culture/music/art), Budapest, Copenhagen (more bike culture), Florence or Venice (art/canals/architecture), Zermatt or Grindelwald (hiking in Alps; but might be better for a late summer trip). We are outdoorsy people and love the mountains and alpine lakes, but also enjoy coastal areas from time to time. I was thinking that late spring/early summer is better to be in southern Europe, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to afford to come back.

It's all a bit overwhelming trying to narrow down the cities and the easiest logistics. I've gathered that we'll book open jaws flights (KLM offers multiday stopovers in Amsterdam which could potentially save time and/or money) and travel between those airports by train. I'm generally okay with staying in the cities (unless we want to spend some time in the Alps) and I don't really want to drive outside of Scotland since we'll be driving a lot there.  Switzerland seems very easy to travel throughout without renting a car, but downside is cost. Given which cities we choose, and in which order, I don't mind train travel, especially if its overnight or a daytime scenic route.

TravelHacks,"I re3cently suffered a travel mishap which was not my fault at all. This was right before the big holiday air travel meltdown in which travelers are still trying to dig their way out of. 

Here are a few things I have learned from both experience and observation:

1. Buy travel- insurance Do not expect your accommodation to pick up the tab and fully refund you because of an airline issue. The hotel/airbnb host has nothing to do with the fact that your flight was cancelled. In this day and age of Covid and everything else, it makes zero sense to pay a little extra for insurance.
2. Know your rights- Understand what your rights are as a passenger, and when things go pear shaped, stand up for those rights! Don't need to be a Karen Supreme, but don't let them get away with shortchanging you. 
3. Be kind- During our air travel mishap which we were diverted to a tiny, closed airport with no amenities overnight, we were waiting for ground crew to set up the jet bridge so we could deplane. During this time, the pilot came out of the cockpit and answered passengers' questions. A couple of men in their 60s aggressively questioned the pilot. ""You said we had to land here because of freezing fog! Are you trying to tell me you couldn't see Rapid City from the plane? I was looking out the window and saw it just fine!"" he calmly answered that while yes, you could see the airport, had we descended through the freezing fog, the fog would create a layer of ice on the plane, and he would not be able to control the plane very well. These older men continued their line of aggressive questioning until they opened the aircraft door. They were trying to make the poor pilot look stupid, but the rest of us understood that he was trying to keep us safe. Being a dick does no one any good, and everyone harm.
4. Always keep a change of clothes, especially underwear, in your carry on! Luckily, we were only held less than 24 hours, but some people are spending 2 and 3 days in the airport. 
5. Keep any medications, at least 3 days worth, in your carry on with you! If you need to gate check you carry on, take out your meds, and keep them with you.
6. If you have dietary restrictions, keep some food with you. I made the mistake of not eating a meal in the airport when I had the chance. I figured I would be home in a few hours, and I could wait to eat. Little did I know, our flight would be first delayed a couple of hours, and then diverted to a closed airport with a single vending machine. Nope, there was nothing in the vending machine I could eat, and I didn't have any more snacks in my bag. While I wasn't in any health danger from missing a meal, I was certainly uncomfortable and hangry. 
7. Take the deal if it's offered. We were offered $520 plus hotel accommodation, plus transportation to and from the hotel, plus a meal voucher if we would have taken the next flight, which was the next day. We considered it, but were afraid the same thing would happen the next day. I wish we had taken the deal. Sleeping in a hotel bed is superior to getting an hour of sleep on the cold floor of the airport. 
8. Be patient. I know it's incredibly frustrating, but anyone who is working in the airport does not make the rules. Your fellow passengers are, like you, doing the best they can.",Learning from the mistakes and misfortunes of others,,vagimite2000,,0,2022-12-28 23:31:29

TravelHacks,"Greetings travellers,

Hoping to explore part of the Patagonian region on both the Chilean &amp; Argentinian side for approximately 2-3 weeks. I have not booked anything as part of a wider no-booking travel philosophy and so rather than criticise this please just take stock of it when imparting your wisdom.

To provide context, I’ll be entering the region from central Chile (I.e. Santiago), I’m looking to travel relatively frugally (as one can in the Patagonian region) without sacrificing on the quality of experience, and will likely arrive within the next week or two. I’m very interested in hiking throughout this Patagonian stint, and have some experience on this front.

I’ll break my many questions into 2 longer doubt-filled riffs below.

1. Booking/Availability/Recommendations

As aforementioned. I haven’t booked anything, my understanding is that this may limit one’s options with regard to hiking, trekking, general activities upon arrival in some of the more tourist-oriented areas. Would it be wise to skip out on these areas altogether (I.e. w-trek, punta arenas) and bee-line straight for somewhere or something a little lesser-known and less geared towards tourism? If so, please let me know any lesser-known gem spots/treks from past lives. Otherwise, any alternative ideas would be appreciated. I do also have 1 week until my visit, so if you think there’s something really worth booking that may have availability - same thing, let me know.

2. Predilection For Frugality/Cost-Saving Tips/Connections

I travel frugally, and sadly, it would seem the Patagonia’s might disagree with this mode of travel. All in all, it’s probably a small price to pay given the beauty of the region, nonetheless, the inner hustler in me would like to know any penny-saving/dollar-maximising tips you may have for this area - particularly any esoteric, area-specific advice outside of the normal (“book directly, and in person”) sort of stuff. Also, if you are a sociable individual with some connections in the area (i.e. a local tour guide or company) that can offer a good price, or are one yourself - message me directly or shamelessly tout your company in the comments, I welcome either.

I’m self-evidently inexperienced in this part of the world so help me out and if you need more information, let me know.",2 doubt-filled riffs on the Patagonian region.,,Womersli,,0,2022-12-28 22:11:16

TravelHacks,"My travel guide (applies to all cities):

1. Book a guided walking tour.

2. Check out the places where you can see a top view of the ciry.

3. Look for local restaurants that serve local dishes and avoid the touristy places for food.

4. Book a boat trip (a must)

5. Check museums that tell something about the city.

6. Pick a special scent to wear or music you associate with that city and let your mind make all the associations as you roam, it shall teleport you back later once you've encountered that scent or music again.

7. Take photos that document your experience and not just camera-worthy shots. Take shaky photos, ruined photos, silly photos and some vids too. Playing them back later is very rewarding.

8. Journal about it if you can and mention all the details that grabbed your attention.

9. Get small souvenirs for yourself that you can use in your daily life and not just leave behind stached in some box. It can always remind you of that time.

10. Pick your travel mates wisely.

11. It's always good if you plan ahead, but if not, don't stress and just go spontaneously, walking around the city shall lead you to the places you need to visit anyways. Getting lost is not always a bad option. It means you see more.

12. Pick the stuff you usually enjoy doing and do it in the cities you visit, don't just try stuff you read in must-visit guides and do it because you have to. Some of them are just phony and underwhelming. Ditch that fomo.

13. Pick transportation methods that show you the best of your route as you travel.

14. Check that city's subreddit and read people's experiences and suggestions.

15. If you're looking for random things to visit while you're in the street and done with all your plans, search tourist attraction on google maps and pick smth you like.

16. Have a look on the local/farmer's market and supermarkets there, even if briefly. It's always fun to have a gist of what the grocery shopping experience feels like in a new place.

17. Been doing video commentary of my travels, it works as somekind of a diary if I didn't have the time to journal + captures the moment and my observations better (can make you look weird to other people looking from the outside though lol)
18. Take photos of your accommodation if you liked it.

19. Send people stuff that reminds you of them if you come across any while you roam. It's sweet.

20. ziplock bags are a life saver forreal, get the big and small ones, shall make your life easier.

21. Watch movies in the cities you are visiting, it's entertaining to run into the same spots irl and see how it feels like when they materialize.

22. Stop and read the stuff they write besides monuments and spots you pass, they can look boring and useless, but mostly they give you a quick overview and some of them are actually well-written. I still remember the time I visited Mauritshuis in Den Haag and I could tell whoever wrote them did actually make some storytelling effort because I genuinely enjoyed reading them.

Before having my son, I (36/F) had traveled quite well and quite extensively. Most exotic place I’ve been to was Cambodia. The last place I traveled to was Colombia.

TravelHacks,"Not really related to Southwest, but this came up in my mind again. I was wondering if travel insurance will allow us to take an alternative travel plan, cost slightly more but avoid a bigger claim.

A real world scenario happened to me before. I had a short 2-day trip, and my flight was cancelled and got re-booked for another flight next day. This can cause enough disruption in order for me to cancel the entire trip, non-refundable cost is about $500. However, I spoke to the airline and got re-re-booked to a flight one day prior instead, this will cost me only $200 for an extra day of hotel. I took the $200 route. (ps: That was also the time when I realized my BoA Alaska card doesn't have travel insurance, which was cancelled since then) In this case, it is obviously a better choice to go for the extra $200 than losing $500 for both me and travel insurance (if I have any). So I wonder how I can make a valid claim out of this.

We would like to see some cultural attractions and learn some of the cities history while also keeping a chilled out vibe.

Some of our itinerary already includes; Duomo di Milano, Sforzesco castle, Chiesa di San Maurizio al Monastero Maggiore, San Bernardino alle Ossa and Museo Nazionale della Scienza e della Tecnologia.

Can anyone make further suggestions, if there is anything in Milan pre-renaissance and Roman I would be so happy. Not interested in going to the San Diego unless we were able to see a football game but I suspect we will be outlpriced with tickets

Any neighbourhoods that are a must visit at night? Preferably somewhere chilled out with nice restaurants that will come to less than 30 euros a head? Any venues where we may be able to catch live music?

Lastly, what is the situation with cannabis dispenseries? Will we be able to use them as tourists or is that a major no no?

TravelHacks,"Traveling to Las Vegas for a 7 days this February for Super Bowl week. I'm hoping to grab a BMW 7 series or X7. Which is the best path to take? 

1. Reserve desired vehicle applying the standard loyalty member discount.
2. Take my chances being upgraded to said vehicles with my loyalty status.
3. Reserve a vanilla sedan and pay for an upgrade from Premium/exotic rows.

My current Loyalty memberships:

Hertz Pres C. 

National- Executive Elite 

Enterprise-Platinum

SIXT-Platinum 

The best quote I currently found is from SIXT via Platinum discount. BMW X7 for around $700 after all taxes and airport fees. Finally, I'm not sure if this matters in regard to improving upgrade chances, but I fly in on a Tues (late afternoon).

I know I am cutting it close, but I would really like to rent a Mini-van while there so I can freely travel with my family. However the car rental companies here in the USA are charging me damn near 3k-4k for the 10 days I'll be there. It is literally cheaper for me to buy a car over there, and then leave it or perhaps sell it. But I would like to avoid doing that all together if any of you guys have any recommendations of car rentals while in Mexico that doesn't charge that much and that is near the Morelos, Mexico area.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone &amp; happy holidays 🎄🎅🏻🎁

I initially posted this on the travel subreddit but for some reason it was removed and the mods offered no explanation why. Anyway I hope this post doesn’t violate any rules of this community.

As you probably already know, thousands of flights in the US have been cancelled due to inclement weather. Many people have been left stranded without a suitable alternative to travel for Christmas. I am among those whose travel plans went awry. 

I spent the whole day today trying to find a way to make it to Atlanta, but the alternatives that I found (bus &amp; train) are just out of the question due to the long travel time. I called a charter company just (out to curiosity) to see what options are out there. 🤔

To my surprise 😮 they said they can book me a 12-seats private jet for north of $40k 🙄. The most I ever spent to book a flight was $1,350 and I did it only because I was traveling to China (which made sense given the distance).

I’m not soliciting any assistance of any kind, I just want to see if there’s a platform where I can sell empty seats or find other travelers with the same itinerary as me, to make this flight a little more affordable. $4k+ is still a lot but I have no other options right now. The flight will be leaving tomorrow around noon, but they are a little flexible on time. 

Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",Last minute option but too expensive… need recommendations,,GuiltyImportance4763,,0,2022-12-24 23:18:29

TravelHacks,"Earlier this year, while looking for a NY Global Entry interview appointment, I got frustrated by the lack of appointments available. It was a huge inconvenience having to keep refreshing the page for days in hopes of getting lucky. I looked around the internet for a solution and saw that every site out there was charging $20 \~ $30 per month to scan for new appointments. There are a couple of Twitter pages but you get notified for a bunch of different locations and the notifications are not always instant.

I spent some time making my own tool called [**TTPTracker.com**](https://ttptracker.com/) to help others in the community. You can think of it as your personal assistant that refreshes the appointment page for you 24/7, 365. With the click of a few buttons, you can start tracking new appointments for any location you want. You can also use it to find appointments that better align with your schedule.

**Super easy to use, here's a preview of it in action:** [**https://i.imgur.com/f52XMcn.gif**](https://i.imgur.com/f52XMcn.gif)

* **FREE** while every site out there is charging $20 - $30 per month
* No limits on the number of locations to track

TravelHacks,"Hello fellow travel heads. Since the year is coming to an end, I wanted to wish you all happy holidays &amp; a happy new year and share my 5 travel hacks from 2022 :D

**1.** **Skiplagged**

You can basically book a layover flight leg AS your destination. I booked a roundtrip flight from Philadelphia airport to Europe last summer for $440 whereas Kayak/Skyscanner/Google Flights cheapest flights started around $890 and had more stops / flight duration. For US flights I typically go from PHL to ATL with 1 carry-on for around $70 rather than $120-$150 without carry-on. And no, most of the time I fly non-stop, so it's not a 32 hour flight or something just to save a hundred bucks.

**2. Get one of those clothes compression bags for travel!**

I slept on this for WAY too long and can't believe it took me all these years to finally try it. You can pack your essential clothes (ones you don't care about wrinkling) into these compression bags then throw them in a backpack (personal item) that usually doesn't have any weight restrictions. This frees up SO MUCH SPACE in my carry-on it's bonkers. I honestly stopped doing checked baggage for domestic flights after doing this because I pack light, fit a bunch of stuff, and it's just so much more convenient.

**3. AirlineStatus**

Another one I kept hearing about but didn't try until this year. I don't fly nearly enough with any 1 airline to earn medallions / statuses &amp; such. With this website, they resell corporate travel benefits from companies that don't end up using them. I was able to buy 1 year of United premier 1K status and it's honestly beyond worth it to me &amp; my partner. I get first class upgrades for myself &amp; my fiance. I can get my group of friends all economy plus when we travel together as well as access to all the cool lounge areas. There's a bunch of other perks like 120% bonus miles &amp; more which I'm still figuring out. Keep in mind, this won't be worth it for everyone. If you fly like once a year, it's not going to be a good use of your money and you may as well use it towards another trip.

**4. Use Airbnb Experiences for Inspiration ONLY**

So I discovered this ""hack"" totally accidentally. My group of friends rented a boat with a captain for the day in Mallorca, Spain. We discovered the experience through Airbnb and booked it for $670 USD. When we arrived, I saw that the boat had stickers on it with logos of other major travel sites as well as some European ones and a website name. After the trip, I was curious so I started googling the same experience using the name of the host &amp; keywords from their airbnb listing. The price on other sites ranged from $420-$500 euros and on their own website it was just $399 euros! ($420 USD). That's a saving of $250 if only I knew about this. From that point on, I exclusively use Airbnb experiences for inspiration then seek out the host on google &amp; other platforms. Part of the reason this works is because Airbnb charges experience hosts a 20% fee for using the platform along with other penalties that force them to increase prices.

**5. Using incognito AND tracker-proof VPN for booking flights**

I would always hear about people using VPNs to hide their location and get cheaper prices on flights. However, every time I tried doing it I would see the same exact prices. I did more research and found [FlightVPN](https://www.flightvpn.com). Most of the big VPNs you hear about aren't truly ""tracker proof"" since they're legally required to report your general location (country data). With this and incognito mode together, I'm able to see about $50-$70 off most flights in the $200-$400 range and up to $150 off on flights above $700. Before booking, check multiple countries. I usually try the destination country as well as a random ""3rd world"" country. Historically I have the best prices when changing location to Turkey, Bulgaria, or Romania. Oh and this sometimes works for hotels too! I usually search SkyScanner, Google Flights, and Kayak using this method.

Hope this helps anyone out there save even $5 on your next trip. It's helped me save a LOT more than that. Again, happy holidays &amp; best wishes in the new year! Safe travels. - Sandra",5 travel hacks that saved me $$$ in 2022,,Sea-Consideration61,,0,2022-12-19 22:43:54

But my main concern is where I should look for places to stay. In the past, I've found long-term airbnbs, but those times I didn't have any dogs. I had good luck back then (about a 3-4 years ago), but I've been reading that Airbnb has really gone down the tube.

I don't mind paying a fee for the dogs to start but after I leave I don't want them to be like ""Hey I found a dog hair, you owe me $70 bucks"" even if I paid a preliminary dog fee.

TravelHacks," Hello, I am creating this post to explain my GoFundMe. I act like I am happy all the time when in reality I am hurting. Since Covid-19, my life has seemed to go downhill even though I am supposed to be in my prime years. I used to love so many things about myself like my ambition and virtue but its seems as though those don't exist inside me anymore. Now all I do is use things like TikTok and videogames to distract myself so that I feel better but I have come to realize it only makes me feel worse. I have developed so many regrets over the past 3 years and have wasted so much time. I am trapped in a town where I know everyone and they know me which has proven to be a hindrance. They have high expectations of the happy and funny guy that I used to be but whenever they see me know it is almost like they know that that man is dead. I have a lot of trauma from various things and it seems to haunt me everyday and I cannot escape it, no matter how hard I try. I cannot go through this suffering anymore or else I know that I will die. I have decided that I want to change. In order to change I must learn and grow but I cannot do that by being here. I have tried but every time that I see someone I know my heart starts racing and the bad thoughts start. My plan is to take a trip. I am going to take a trip by myself and I am going to meet as many people I can. I have learned that when I am around people I can relate to and we talk about important things, I feel a warm sensation in my heart. If you want to know my full plan about my Trip of Life then please read my GoFundMe page. I hope that if any of you are struggling with something please reach out to someone and if you need me you can always message me. I hope you have a great day!

TravelHacks,"Hi! Very long subject but I'm hoping someone a bit more knowledgeable can help.

I booked a return flight LON-MAD via British Airway's website.  
The flights are both operated by Iberia. When trying to select seats, I was only being given the option for the return flight, with the departing saying ""contact us"". I tried going to Iberia's website directly and entering their booking reference to see that only the return flight is showing up (and for them looks like a ""one-way ticket""). I called them and they saw the two flights but said the LON-MAD had not made it to the booking and BA needed to sort it out.  
Called BA (1h on hold each of the three times I have ringed, story for another day) and they say something about OneWorld and needing to reinstate the flight, to ""give it 24h"", but nothing has changed. I'm due to fly in 2 days and using BA's booking reference I see the two flights and the departing still showing as ""flight not available, contact airline"".

Any idea what's going on and how to solve this?  
This time I'm travelling whilst recovering from an injury and surgery so really not ideal to make it all the way to the airport and potentially deal with some stuff there.  


Thanks all !!","Booked with BA, flight operated by Iberia - both flights showing on BA (one says ""Flight not available""), but only flight shows on Iberia - Call center says flight needs to be reinstated, but it doesn't happen and I'm due to flight in 2 days.",,iamveek,,0,2022-12-18 18:37:37

TravelHacks,"While I was on vacation in a much warmer place, a huge snowstorm hit my home region in the US. I laughed and posted pics of the beach. I thought it would be cleared up by now. Nope. 

That I was unable to check in online for the second (home) segment of my return trip should have been a warning. When I checked in at the airport kiosk, I was issued a boarding pass with no seat number, and an advisement to check in with the gate agent. Uh oh.

When I did so, the agent said the flight was over booked, and we needed to just sit tight and they would explain in a few minutes. Uh oh.

For this tiny little puddle jumper, they were asking for five people to fly out on a later flight, and in return, they would be put up in a hotel, be provided transportation to and from the airport, and get a $520 voucher for future travel. 

We were tempted, but worried that the same thing would happen tomorrow, so we declined. 
Our flight was full. It was then delayed because they needed a new pilot. *SIGH* Ok, at least we will be in our own bed that night, right?

As we approached our home airport, it was apparent that we couldn't land because of freezing fog. We were diverted to another airport, which is in Bismarck, North Dakota, which is a 5-6 hour drive by car. Also, big chunks of Interstate 90 were closed. 

Speaking of closed, the airport at Bismarck had just shut down for the night, and they had to call in staff to get us down to the ground, out of the plane, and into the terminal. 

Bismarck, being a small town located in the wrong Dakota, is not equipped to deal with an influx of overnight passengers. Airport camping it is.

This leads me to my travel hack: if you have to sleep on the floor of an airport terminal, packing cubes stuffed full of clothing make a decent pillow.

TravelHacks,"Chile 8 day trip - Advice Needed

Background: I am not an avid traveler and with my commitments, I barely get time to travel. Since I have never been to South America, I decided to travel to Chile for a week over Christmas. Here is what I have planned so far. I can always extend my trip for a day or two if you guys think it’s too ambitious. And I can cut back on activities as well.

Day 1: Arrive in Santiago and explore the city
Day 2: Bus to Valparaiso, explore the city, and then back to Santiago
Day 3: Flight to Calama and then shuttle to San Pedro de Atacama. Catch the sunset at Moon Valley and then night stay at San Pedro de Atacama.
Day 4: Early start - Tatio Geysers, then Puritama hot springs. Rest for a couple of hours. Tour out to Laguna Chaxa + Laguna Tebinquinche.
Day 5: Flight from Calama to Punta Arenas. Speed boat to Magdalena Island. Bus to Puerto Natales.
Day 6: Estancia La Peninsula (one day tour) + dinner at the Singular Patagonia.
Day 7: Rental Car to Torres Del Paine. 1 day hike up to the three towers. Drive back to Puerto Natales and rest for the night.
Day 8: flight to santiago and then back home.

Also, if you guys have any experience with Moon Valley, how did you get there? I am seeing horseback tours that are 5 hours but there aren’t too many details online. Also is it possible to get a guide or join a tour for that trek in Torres del Paine? I am okay going solo everywhere but I think a tour guide might be really helpful for this hike.

Also, any advice on how i can cut costs is appreciated

I decided to take a look around and see if I could find a big SUV that seats 8ppl so we could all ride together. I searched through many different popular websites only to find that alot of them had no availability for large SUV’s during this time period ( not long after Xmas and right before New Years ) the ones I did come across were quoting anywhere from $400-600 after all the fees were included. I ended up finding one website that was reasonable but I would have to drive about 20 min to pick up the vehicle witch I was willing to do. They quoted me at 240$ with tax and fees I decided to book it since pickings were slim and there was no Penalty to cancel. Not long after I remembered about Costco travel and decided I’d take a look since I’ve been a long time member. They ended up pulling up the same exact vehicle , from a location that’s only 5 minutes down the road , same terms and conditions for $142.00 taxes and fees included. That’s an amazing deal for a big SUV like this and especially during holiday travel times. I booked it immediately and just for the hell of it I decided to see what it would cost if I booked it directly without using Costco. The quote was $333.54. That’s almost a $200 savings for just booking through Costco travel. I defiantly suggest more people use it if you’re not already familiar.

TravelHacks,"When packing for a trip, it's important to plan ahead and think about the activities you will be doing, the weather you will be experiencing and the overall style and purpose of your trip. For a three-week trip, you will want to pack enough clothes to last you the entire time, but not so much that you are weighed down by heavy luggage. Here are a few things to consider when packing for a three-week trip:

Comfortable and versatile clothing

Bring a mix of clothing that can be dressed up or down, and that will be appropriate for the weather and activities you have planned. This might include T-shirts, pants, shorts, dresses, and sweaters.

Footwear

In addition to your everyday shoes, consider bringing a pair of comfortable walking shoes or hiking boots if you plan to do any outdoor activities. You may also want to bring sandals or flip flops for the beach or pool.

Toiletries and personal items

We suggest purchasing the dry wet separate travel toiletry bag to bring all of your essential toiletries, such as toothpaste, shampoo, and sunscreen. You may also want to bring any prescription medications you take on a regular basis.

If you are a frequent traveler, organize your toiletries, quickly and efficiently is important for you. Tacticism toiletry organizer can meet all your demands. Water-resistant material, carrying handle &amp; moll design, separate multiple pockets make you travel confidently knowing that your toiletries will be kept in their place.

Electronics

Depending on the purpose of your trip, you may want to bring a laptop, tablet, or other electronic devices. Be sure to pack any necessary charging cables and adapters and consider bringing a portable charger for your phone in case you cannot find an outlet.

Documents

Don't forget to bring your passport, driver's license, and any other important documents you may need during your trip. It's also a good idea to make copies of these documents in case they get lost or stolen.

Overall, the key to packing for a three-week trip is to plan ahead and bring a mix of clothing and items that will suit the activities and weather you will be experiencing.

TravelHacks,"I have been traveling the world since 2018 with an international carry-on 21"" TUMI Alpha and a fairly large TUMI Alpha backpack, never checking bags.

However - in 2023, I'll be away for much longer periods, like several months at a time, including Jan/Feb in India and Mar/Apr in London, both of which will require some heavier warmer clothes. I'm also going to want space to take away some ayurvedic herbs, souvenirs, etc. from India.

It has always been a challenge to fit everything in my 21"" TUMI, especially because I'm a meditation teacher and travel with a brass puja kit and teaching supplies that cannot be sourced locally. 

I am growing weary of the ""packing game"" and considering just buying a checked luggage which I would equip with an AirTag for tracking and a protective cover. 

I'm considering the Briggs &amp; Riley Baseline Spinner Large, because the XL size is 68.5"" total dimensions, and my preferred airline American's oversize limit is 62"". 

I'm a OneWorld ruby member, so free checked bags, but that won't help with oversize limits.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTION 1:  In your experience, how strict are airlines (specifically American) about the oversize dimensions? Do you think I should go for the 68"" dimensions and hope nobody notices? I definitely don't want to spend $1000 on a bag if I'm going to have to spend $100 to check it every time.

I checked the website, and I have to be honest: those prices are too good to be true.

My gf and I have stumbled into a unique blessing, but now faced with a challenge of options. Her family had planned a African safari prior to the world shutting down due to covid.

So basically I am seeking ideas for an itenierary that would provide some options of hitting multiple locations, the difficult part being that we need to book travel very soon.

Wondering if anybody has any positive/negative experiences using GoSplitty to book hotels? My gut tells me there's some shadiness going on here but I decided to give them a shot for a hotel in New Orleans over NYE. Their pricing for the particular hotel was around 50% of the cost everywhere else so likely a ""too good to be true"" situation but I booked it anyway using my Amex Plat which has really good purchase protection/travel benefits. Figure if it goes south I can just deal with AMEX to get my money back.

I did call the hotel this morning and they told me my reservation is confirmed in their system at the rate that I booked via GoSplitty but that it's currently showing as unpaid on their end. I'm clearly going to check in with the hotel a couple more times including the day before we're supposed to arrive.

Any thoughts as to what might happen here? What's GoSplitty's angle? Are they going to cancel my reservation last minute saying the hotel is at full occupancy and try to put me in some crappy hotel of their choice instead?

TravelHacks,"TA cancelled my ticket without notification on a UA flight. I recently learned about affordable award flights on Star Alliance partner airlines from the points Guy and was excited to try this out.

I used miles and smiles to book a RT ticket on a United operated flight seemingly without issue. Initially I had already booked an awards flight directly thru UA and then cancelled it after learning about and then booking thru TA.

The trouble started when TA wouldn’t let me reserve seats anywhere, I tried every outlet. Next, using the TA confirm code I was able to add the booking to my UA profile but only the departure flight was showing. From there I could at least book seats. When I called UA they told me that only the departure flight was on the booking and to ask TA to “reinstate” my return flight. After many calls all I could get were promises that I was “ok” 

Then the next day the booking was removed from my UA profile entirely. When I try to add either the TA or UA confirm code back again to “my flights” it says “your itinerary can’t be retrieved since there are no flight segments”.

UA claims TA cancelled my tickets, although another agent hypothesized that the system detected I was “double booked” and canceled automatically— even though I cancelled my UA reservation right after booking thru TA. And TAs agents have been useless- each one gives me another dead end although the last one finally admitted that it does appear cancelled but is a “technical issue” and I now have to wait 3 days for someone to call me and then finally reissue the ticket. Should I just keep calling until someone agrees to do this? Starting to feel kinda desperate and exhausted.

TravelHacks,"Looking for some advice on how to best book this.

I'm looking at flying into Japan in the early-middle of April and staying for 10-14 days. While I'm there, I wanted to see different cities.

What I'm looking for is the best way to book hotels in multiple cities in Japan with ONE airline ticket to and from Tokyo.

Expedia seems by far the best, having the cost of the Hotel + Flight be basically the same as just the flight, but it appears that the hotel would be effectively limited to one city, and I'm not super keen on doing day trips to multiple cities from Tokyo.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can best book this without paying an arm and a leg?

TravelHacks,"**Situation:**

I found a great multi-city flight on Skyscanner and the legs look like this:

1st leg: Vancouver (YVR) to Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) - using **Air Canada**

2nd leg: Ho Chi Minh City (SGN) to Tokyo (NRT) - using **All Nippon Airways**

3rd leg: Tokyo (NRT) to Vancouver (YVR) - using **Air Canada**

**Problem:**

The problem is when I attempt to book this multi-city round trip on Air Canada's website, I can't book the 2nd leg. It does not show any SGN to NRT flights.

Also, when I attempt to see the book each leg separately (all as one-way tickets), the price significantly exceeds the price I see on Skyscanner.

**What else I've tried:** 

I attempted to make this multi-city booking through Expedia but the price is 20% higher that way.

I also attempted to use the a booking site that Skyscanner linked me to (Flight Network) but they don't take AMEX, which is the only card I have that has flight insurance.

Am I doing this wrong? May I ask how I should approach this? This is my the first multi-legged flight I'll have booked so please forgive my ignorance.

TravelHacks,"Booked a hotel room through them after finding the room on trivago. I arrived at the hotel to find that they were under a public health order due to a positive reading for Legionella. 

I called immediately to cancel, and was told they needed to contact ""their partner"" and would resolve the cancelation within 48 hours. I also made sure to get a letter from the hotel confirming they were ok with the cancellation (all the hotel could tell me was that the room had been ""isolated."" Nothing about sterile filters, or about how they treated their plumbing against the bacteria, despite those being the mitigations listed on the website they had listed on the warning sign that started it all. Imagine not being able to shower at a supposedly 4-star hotel!).

Lo and behold, they didn't reply within 5 days, and when contacted, said in separate responses that a) I didn't cancel on time, b) that there were no refunds and c) that because I could check in and the hotel didn't approve, they wouldn't return my money. I've sent them the letter from the hotel, but I assume given their scammy behaviour so far, it's going to be a waste of time.

TravelHacks,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, I had to move out from the country where I had spent the past 6 years of my life. It might not seem that long for someone. But, for me, it's an end of an era, and in 2 weeks, I am starting a new chapter in my life. The funny thing is that I didn't want to move here in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 years ago, I had to move to the UK for one year. It was a job-related decision. My company transferred me to the UK branch because I was single. They rented an excellent apartment for me to make my transition smooth. I didn't want to go there, but I just kept saying that it was only temporary.

&amp;#x200B;

After 6 months living in the UK, I fell in love with this country. I've met so many wonderful people who later turned out to be my excellent friends. I fell in love and also fell out of love. I've discovered new hobbies and become a completely new person here. I didn't want to move back home, so I decided to quit my job and find another job that could sponsor my visa.

&amp;#x200B;

But my employment contract is over. Besides, my employer found a local person to replace me with. He said he couldn't afford to sponsor my visa anymore with these new price increases. I mean, I don't blame him. Maybe I wasn't anywhere close to being the employee of the month. Still, he gave me some time to find another job that would sponsor my visa. As you might have guessed, I couldn't find anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my ticket back is booked, and I'm slowly saying goodbye to all my friends and favorite places. I'm gonna miss them so much.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing on my to-do list is to pack my entire life into several suitcases. You can see in the picture that I'm halfway there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I could have shipped all my stuff back home. But, when I checked the shipping prices, I would say that it's less costly to invest £2m and get a sponsorship visa. So, buying a ticket back home and paying for extra suitcases is a lot cheaper for me. I'm also thinking of getting similar to this leather carry-on bag to pack some stuff with me on board and get rid of that small bag you can see in the picture on top of my suitcases.",How do I pack my entire life into a few suitcases?,,Amissindent,,0,2022-12-05 10:26:13

Could we buy one then return it for cheaper/less headache of hauling around two seats on top of luggage and little ones. Maybe donate it because we’d have no use for it afterwards. It’d be nice if the car rental places came with a car seat option for rental. I wish I could call enterprise/hurtz and be like “We need a minivan with kid seats!” If you have experience w traveling w the seats. Is there anything you have done different in retrospect.

TravelHacks,"I am in the United States and planning to travel to Brazil soon.  I am going to need a rental car for my duration in Brazil. When I travel domestically, I always decline the rental car company's insurance because my Amazon VISA covers up to a million dollars of damage to the vehicle for zero deductible. Any damage to someone else's vehicle or property is still covered through my GEICO policy.  When I travel internationally, I can still use my Amazon VISA to cover the car itself, but GECIO doesn't offer property damage liability coverage. 

I was wondering if there's a cheaper option to go with besides the property damage liability coverage offered at the rental car counter since that $15 plus bucks a day on top of the rental car price starts adding up quickly.

Starting next year I plan on staying longer in the EU for a relationship. I have some questions about how the 90/180 visa rule works.

I assume that my 180 days started on Nov 3, 22 and ended on May 3, 23. That means I had another 180 days from May 4, 23 to Nov 4, 23. My current visa entry dates would be Nov 5, 23 to May 5, 23. I recently took a trip from Nov 22, 23 to Dec 1, 23 which was 9 days total from when I got my passport stamped. I know that I can't spend more than 90 days in the EU within 180 days. I plan on spending around 30 days between Jan and Feb in 2023. Then possibly I may return at the end of April for 7 days. That means I'll probably used 45-46 days within my 180 days. I have until May 5, 23 to use up all 90 days, right? I read that if I used my all my 90 days, I have to stay out of the EU for another 90 days, but that only applies within the 180 days allocation?

TravelHacks,"Hi, I (M35, US) have been doing some research lately about tourist visas and found it hard to get the correct info. After doing the tedious work, I thought I could write a post on where you can find the best and trusted visa info, and what companies you can consider when applying for a visa.

**1. Contact The Embassy**

Firstly, the most accurate visa information you can get would be at the Embassy of the country you are traveling to. You can either go to the Embassy website or you can contact them straight. However, I suggest you try and find answers on the website.

I suggest you try searching for an Embassy the following way: let's say perhaps you are a US citizen and want to travel to India. Then, you'll need to find the ""Indian Embassy in the US"".

Quick Tip: US citizens can try Washington and New York Embassies for the most detailed info.

**2. Only believe trusted visa companies**

Believe me when I say there are hundreds of companies that provide visas, but only a few stand out as exceptional. Here's my list of ""Visa Service Companies"" I have used in the past:

\- VisaHQ

\- Atlys

\- TraVisa

\- VFS

I know contacting the Embassy might seem like common sense, but always try and contact them first as their information would be the most reliable. DO NOT rely on other people's information when applying for visas. If a website says something and you can't find proof on the Embassy page, you should rather believe the Embassy.

I hope you find this information helpful.

Also, share the hacks you used for getting a visa in a pinch.

Please Help me reddit. Im stressing out about this and I need clear instructions on how to get this done.  
Ill  be traveling from the US to Europe soon, and once I arrive, my US sim  card wont be able to send/receive texts or calls. This leaves me in  quite a bit of a bind because I need verification texts to long into my  bank account online, and use my whatsapp profile. Ill be abroad for half a year at least.

I  looked online and one site said google voice VOiP but that costs $20 to  transfer over my number. And wouldnt I still not be able to use my  phone without a european SIM, unless I was on wifi?

Someone else told me to download skype and pay for another number, but that costs a *monthly* sub of $9 as well as my regular US phone service costs to keep my number active, right?

Am I over thinking this? This scenario wasnt a problem for me 10 years ago but now **everything**  requires 2 step verification. The moment I change to a european SIM  card, I wont be able to receive the necessary text message to use my US  whatsapp number.  
Does anyone know of an easy and preferably free way I  can keep my US number, and send/receive necessary text messages and  calls to people I know in US/Europe??",Need help,,vizualdesperado88,,0,2022-11-30 17:47:46

Forgive me if it’s going to be long and chaotic but I don’t know what to do anymore, maybe someone can give me some advice. I bought both ways flight tickets with Lufthansa from Ireland to Poland and back. Both of them are with a layover. We registered pet in cabin afterwards and have been told to wait 48hours for confirmation. No problem. Then I got an email saying that pet in cabin has been confirmed for all flights except the one from Munich (layover) to Dublin. I was told to contact them which I did. They said that unfortunately there are restrictions with travelling pet in cabin to Ireland and they can’t confirm the last flight. I was severely shocked because I’m flying to Dublin with my dog all the time and never had a problem with different airlines. I asked then for my options and got told that the dog has to stay in Munich (!!!!!) because they can’t take him on the plane or fly cargo which is also impossible because of the breed of my dog. So basically I was left without an option since I can’t leave my dog in Poland. I learnt later on that Lufthansa has some agreements with Irish government that makes it impossible to take pet in cabin. In that situation I asked them for a full refund which they are refusing… customer service is not helpful at all, constantly saying all supervisors are in the meetings and can’t talk to me. Is there anything else I can do? I can’t fly without my dog and can’t afford to lose over 400€ that I paid….",Lufthansa refuses pet in cabin to Ireland,,richmordarski,,0,2022-11-29 10:54:01

TravelHacks,"Hi! So I booked a good black friday flight deal to europe that leaves from a city in my country that I don't live in. I bought it planning around buying separate flights to and from that departing city, to just book my own connecting flights basically. However, it dawned upon me that the returning flight from europe has a layover in another city that is closer to where I live, and so I could just buy my return flight to my hometown straight from that layover city and save myself 6 hours of extra flights.

This is what I have booked right now:

* Flight from city A to Europe non-stop
* Europe to City B
* City B to City A

Booked Separately: 

* Hometown to City A

Solutions in Question:

* Skip Flight City B to City A and book a separate City B to Hometown flight, or;
* Follow through and fly City B to City A and then book a separate City A to Hometown flight.

I understand that airlines hate people who skiplag and will at least threaten to ban you if you get caught... but I feel like this isn't necessarily the same as skiplagging? It would have the same effect of abandoning a connecting flight (City B to City A) but it wouldn't be with the intention of saving money directly so much as saving time. Granted the airline might not see a difference between those two things.

I guess too, even if they perceived it to be skiplagging, there'd be no worry about the airline cancelling return flights or anything on us as it'd be the last flight of our trip.

I imagine this is inadvisable but I figured it's worth asking because City B to Hometown flights are a smidge cheaper than City A to Hometown flights and, more importantly, it would mean 6 hours less of travel time.

Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.",Question about a scenario that would be sort-of(?) a version of skip-lagging,,inmiamipyjamas,,0,2022-11-28 22:32:55

Any tips on guaranteeing you'll have a 4WD rental?  I booked Avis through Priceline, called the local branch phone #, they said pulling up my rental, it's 4WD.

TravelHacks,"I have some United credit through Chase (from a rebooked flight at lower cost) that I have to use by tomorrow. My wife and I are looking to go to Spain next June and thinking of using the credit on that. For some reason, it can't be a round trip and must be two separate outgoing/incoming flights from NY. The outgoing credit is $500 and the incoming is $350.

However, I'm seeing that United flights mostly end up being $500-$800 more expensive than some similar flights so it's like the credit (that I already paid) doesn't matter. We are going to be visiting Barcelona, Madrid, Sevilla, Malaga and Granada from Jun 9 (overnight flight) - Jun 25. We have been looking at these options to fly:

* NY - &gt; Malaga, Barcelona -&gt; NY
* NY -&gt; Madrid, Barcelona -&gt; NY (This might require domestic flight between Malaga/Barcelona)
* NY -&gt; Barcelona, Madrid -&gt; NY (This might require domestic flight between Malaga/Barcelona)
* Then ""round trips"" to Barcelona or Madrid (These would also require taking a train to get to the flight and maybe a domestic flight between Malaga/Barcelona

Should we just deal with the higher prices since we're stuck with United on this credit and do the first option because it doesn't require a domestic flight or taking a train to get to the airport?

TravelHacks,"Short and sweet:

 I Booked a place in Mexico for $4,200. Cancelled said place later that same day when we found something on a Airbnb. 

Refund window was 15 days, and we are 50 days out. Should be easy full refund. But no, because vrbo doesn’t control funds appearently. Request refund and silence form owner for 3 weeks. Finally I get the “property manager” on the phone. Well he says he says the place sold over a year and is locked out of his account. He Can’t refund as he’s not the owner. He calls vrbo they won’t let him access his account because he isn’t the owner. 

Vrbo phone support (like talking to a brick wall) says they will call the owner and the cycle of madness repeats. Owner is not the owner. I can’t imagine if I went to Mexico and showed up at someones home and tried convincing them I need it for my family vacation. WTF vrbo. Hoping my credit card chargeback goes through…

TravelHacks,"First time international traveler coming from the eastern US and trying to figure some things out!
So, my two favorite bands are performing in Germany two days apart from eachother July 2023. Considering this is (probably?) their last tour for both of them (neither have confirmed but both have older members), I really want to see them and have also wanted to go to Europe for a long time. I would need to be in Germany July 7 and July 9, but really have no other specifications for this trip.
Does anyone have advice on how to travel cheap to Europe? More so with actually GETTING there as I haven’t had any trouble looking for housing accommodations. I don’t even mind flying into a different country and taking a train to Germany if that would make it cheaper, I just know I want to go.

I've been using Skyscanner and similar sites to find a flight.  I'm considering a direct or connecting flight to another city a week before, visit, then fly to my sister, but can't decide where.  I haven't seen much of the US and have the time and some money, well, not 5 star hotel type of reserve capital.

There seems to be cheaper flights to Texas, Florida, Chicago IL, Las Vegas NV, Denver CO, California, ... then some 1 stop connecting flights to cities like New Orleans LA, Boston MA, Phoenix AZ, etc.  I've never been to any of the aforementioned places.

Anyway, I'm split between Chicago or New Orleans or perhaps elsewhere. Chicago c/would be cold &amp; maybe more expensive for lodgeing, but easier with two direct flights.  New Orleans would be warmer, great music, ... but more flying or at least connecting both ways. 

I really appreciate good music, all sorts of food, cities, but also was considering someplace if there was good hiking nearby. Phoenix? I do not know.

TravelHacks,"Years ago I missed my flight by hours and when I got the airport, I stopped at three ticket counters and one was like $179 and the other two were about fifty bucks. On my phone the best I saw was over $300 iirc. This was the opposite of what I expected, I assumed they’d take me to the cleaners since they had me over a barrel. I thought maybe they were just doing some clever computer work because they felt bad for me but across 3 different airlines, I doubt it. 

Anyway, has anyone experienced similarly? I often drive a route that has frequent flights and would overall be quicker than driving but invariably the dates I have are like $275 and the days around it are $175. I’m wondering if it’d be worth trying to see if I can get a good rate if I showed up to the airport.

I suppose I could just go try this out a few times and see what happens. But I’m curious if anyone has experience with this.

1) if I buy ticket through travel agent, and they use SABRE to book tickets for me. The flight ticket fare is 1000USD and the tax is 500USD. The agent says the cancellation fee is 120USD, which means , if I cancel the ticket, the fee refunded to me is (1000-120USD) 880USD while the refund on the tax will be up to the airline of which the amount cannot be told upon purchase and would take long. Is this true?

2) if I buy ticket at the airline website. The air transport charge (including the fare and carrier surcharge ) is 1000USD and the charge on fees, taxes, charges is 500USD. The cancellation fee stated is 120USD. If i cancel the ticket, should the fee refunded to me be 1380USD (ie 1500-120) , or, it would be the same as case 1, that refund of 880USD on the ticket fare can be confirmed but the refund on tax/fees/charges is unknown?

I'm planning to take my first big roadtrip here in California (and into Vegas for a bit) but I really don't have knowledge when it comes to renting a car. My family has rented in Mexico but that's a bit different. Original plan was to take my car but things back fired lol.. 

* My friend (25+) and I (23) are planning to rent a car. I don't know much about the rental process in the states but I did read that we don't really need to get additional insurance since the car insurance that my friend has should cover it. Of course not all but basics. 
* I don't have my own car insurance since I'm in a household with several cars (and car title is still sadly not under my name yet) so thought to throw that out there, which is why we'd be using my friends. We still plan to get in touch to see what it his insurance covers for him. But is additional car insurance with the rental worth it? We'd only be renting it either 3/5 days. Going to San Francisco, Vegas and back to L.A if that helps. 
* Now here's one thing I'm curious if anyone has any experience. While my friend is going to be renting the car under his name is it possible for me to pay it? Or does it strictly have to be under his credit card since he's renting it? Reason I plan to pay is because I have the Costco Citi visa Card (heard it offers a bit of car insurance to begin with) and because I had told him we were going to use my car and didn't work out in the end lol.

TravelHacks,"The plan is to travel in January for about a week. We aren't people people, so resorts aren't our thing. We'd like someplace quiet, private, with a pool but close to restaurants, on the ocean, and clean. AirBnb doesn't have the reliability we'd like for top season travel although a different rental would be great. We probably need a travel agent but don't know how to pick one well, that isn't to say we can't plan our own trip just that since it's fairly late maybe someone who knows the lay of the land would be better. 

Due to an injury things like zip cords etc are out a couple to three miles of walking a day is about the best we can hope for although snorkeling could be fun. 

Is it just too late to plan a trip like this? Thoughts as to where?

TravelHacks,"Hi, I’m looking to fly from australia to London early next year. Atm, looking to layover in both Hong Kong and vietnam return trip.

Issue is google flights is showing a significantly lower price and when I look on the actual carrier website, the prices are much higher.

From google flight, it takes you to booking.com and then gotogate to book.

My issue is I am worried if we were to book through a third party site, if we were wanting to change/cancel. It would be significantly harder or maybe impossible unless we pay for their premium package which is an additional $150 each. We’re also looking to potentially upgrade our seats as it’ll be a long flight.

Any advice on how to go around this? Should we just book through gotogate or straight from the carrier? Is gotogate reliable on cancellations or changes to flight?

TravelHacks,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

I always get in those situations when I accidentally grab someone else bag. I don't do it on purpose. I'm not a kleptomaniac or something like that. It happens just because of the lack of attention from my side. But, on the other hand, I don't agree that it's my fault that all bags in the airport on the baggage chain look the same :) Besides, the name tags are too small to spot the right name.

&amp;#x200B;

It often happens to me when I accidentally grab someone's bag. I usually notice the bag is not mine before I exit the airport. But, this time, I got into trouble just because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a late-night flight. I was exhausted and saw the only bag on the baggage chain. It looked the same as mine, and I didn't even bother to check the tag on it. I grabbed the bag, got into the cab, and asked the driver to take me to my home.

&amp;#x200B;

When I reached home, I only wanted to shower, have some water and go to bed. But when I unzipped my bag to grab my toiletries, I found a fur coat. It didn't belong to me, for sure. Then I turned on the lights and read the name tag on it. The name was pretty similar to mine, but it wasn't me.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided not to rush back to the airport and called them in the morning. There, I found out that the lady whose back I'd stolen had already reported me to the police. She saw me taking her bag and tried to stop me. But I was so tired that I didn't even hear her screaming at me. It was hard to explain this to the police officers. But, some of them got my point and tried to calm down that lady and ensure that I didn't have any bad intentions toward her belongings. I even tried to say to her that I'm vegan and I'm against fur.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after that long night, I decided to screw those classy black suitcases. I need to get something bright. Indeed, I've already found the bag I want — [https://vonbaer.com/products/voyager-leather-carry-on-bag-with-wheels](https://vonbaer.com/products/voyager-leather-carry-on-bag-with-wheels).

2 of us got the Eurail pass for our Europe (London, Paris, St.Moritz/Zermatt, Bruges, Amsterdam and Berlin) trip coming up in December, and although some train rides require reservations, some are free with the pass. However, there’s an option to reserve seats anyways but I’m wondering if it’s worth it? As we’re travelling in winter it may not be as busy, but it’s also holiday season? 

I’m leaning towards reserving seats anyways so we’re guaranteed the exact (time and duration wise) train ride we want. Although, it would be nice to save money where we can, but at the same time, we wouldn’t want to spend unnecessary hours on the train.

Anyone have a recommendation for favorite underseat carry on? Not looking for actual luggage recommendations but the best personal item size bag for the million things you need on a flight with kids. Something easy to get into, easy to organize, large opening so you don’t have to dig through it. Open to backpacks, diaper bags, duffle bags, etc. Want something that will last so cost isn’t an issue. After looking at a lot of bags, I think something with a large top opening that is duffle or diaper bag shaped would work best. Possibly something I could leave unzipped while under the seat without everything spilling out. Considering the Patagonia black hole duffle, Briggs and Riley underseat duffle and a few other random bags. Basically your favorite bag to make traveling with 3 little kids a little less of a s**t show =]",Best underseat bag for traveling with kids,,Maleficent_One1915,,0,2022-11-11 18:53:04
TravelHacks,"Hey all,

So I’ve written here previously about building a US trip around a friend’s wedding at Oregon in August-September 2023.

We’ll start in New York visiting friends there, than fly to Oregon (wedding in Crook Point), rent a car and travel 5-6 days around Oregon (Bend, Crater Lake, a lot more stuff) and end up in Seattle. From this point, we’re likely to fly to Chicago (because a friend really wants to and we’re all cool with it), and that was supposed to be it.

The big game changer came when I’ve discussed working remotely with my boss and he easily and happily approved for me to work from the States for a while. So now I have an extra, well, 2 weeks I guess to spend in the US with a friend - and honestly there’s so many options I’m kinda lost!

A bit about preferences: this will be my 6th time in the US so I would rather skip the “big” tourist cities (no California, Vegas, etc). I’m very much interested in lesser big, more charming cities (of course the occasional big city is cool). I have a lot of interest in music, and theme parks are also great. Plus, since there’s a work portion, it needs to be a city that’s modern and comfortable enough to work remotely from.

Right now my idea is to go to Nashville - a city I’ve absolutely loved on my last visit, and seems close enough to Chicago. From there, I’ve thought of two major options:

\-To go east - I’ve heard a lot of good things about Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, SC and they are close enough to each other, so one option is to go to that direction. Possibility of stopping in the Smokey mountains on the way. 

\-To go west - Even though I’ve been to Colorado before, I’ve absolutely loved it and thinking of going again (maybe this time I’ll actually catch a show at Red Rocks), and than I thought of maybe New Mexico (heard great things about Santa Fe, some nice dessert views, and being a huge Breaking Bad/Saul fan also helps).

Of course, those are just general blueprints - any combination of those, or a whole different direction is also possible (would love to hear any suggestions - it’s really open!). It’s going to be mid to end September, I’m not really sure which places are more ideal to visit in this time of year.

One last thing - New Orleans. It’s a bit of a dream destination for me, but I’ve heard that going in August-September is terrible weather and hurricane risk. I’m thinking of putting it at the end of the trip - basically postponing as much as I can, to have better weather. Do you think it’s wise? What’s the earliest time when NOLA will be pleasant enough to visit?

I know that’s a lot but thanks for bearing with me!

Would welcome any advice, suggestion or opinion on this trip. Thanks!",Help planning/recommending US cities to work and have fun in,,yaniv297,,0,2022-11-11 17:45:39

-I have to attend a two hour timeshare presentation at my local Wyndham property this weekend. This will be painful and I’m not interested in purchasing a timeshare, but if it’s one of the few catches then I can suffer through it.
-I paid $40 to lock me into attending this presentation. Don’t judge, I’d come from brunch. Apparently I will get this back if I attend the the presentation.
-Allegedly, after this presentation, I’ll be able to book my free trip.
-The free trip is for 6 people. 
-I’ve read on a forum that a major downside is that I can’t book my free trip until 30 days or less before my trip. So there’s a chance that everything at the resort of my choice will be booked, or at least the good stuff won’t be available. Plus, it’ll be rough for me and my group to plan around with just a 30 day horizon.

I assumed it had just been cut recently and it was fine. It also wasn't refrigerated but it looked totally fresh. I got some SERIOUS food poisoning that day. I wrongly assumed that it was from a curry that I ate, so 5 days later I got some from a different stall and got food poisoning again...

After researching I discovered that pre cut fruit is something you should avoid, especially in developing countries. The rind or peel protects the inside of the fruit or vegetable from bacteria. As soon as you cut it it's shelf life goes way down too. Pre cut fruit is often handled with no gloves and also not cooked so any bacteria can grow on it easily. It's also often out in the open so bacteria can build up over time, and often it is washed in local tap water. So if you want to eat fruit while you're traveling you should just buy something you can peel yourself.",Don't eat pre-cut fruit,,xXCosmicChaosXx,,0,2022-11-10 12:00:16

I've got a 35% off discount with TravelPro at the current moment and I'm having trouble deciding which set to go with between the Platinum Elite and the Versapack. The Versapacks are cheaper, arguably more durable, and the Global carry-on fits within the 22 x 14 x 9 carry-on size requirements of most major airlines. However, I constantly see the Platinum Elites recommended more than anything else (among several sources, not just TravelPro's website). I think I like the design and features of the Platinum better, but even the smallest carry-on in the line is still an inch over (.5"" in two directions) the size restrictions, and even though the consensus seems to be most gate attendants usually aren't going to bother to check, I'm worried about if one day I come across an attendant who's having a bad day and measures it. However, since most of the travel I do is by road, and usually only travel by air once a year at best, I don't know if that part is even worth considering.

Does anyone have any input? I have been debating this for weeks now and I'm still stumped!

I always take pictures before/after just in case, and this one time I forgot to do so (I know, stupid)

I drove it the entire time and nothing happened. Upon return, I inspected it and didn't see any scratch (stupidly, didn't take pictures again).

A day later I get contacted by Sixt regarding a scratch on the bumper. Like 10cm wide as if someone bumped and scratched over a wall or something.

I went to the Sixt store, spoke to the same guy who did all the paperwork explaining it was not me, etc. He instructed me to reply to the e-mail explaining the situation, which I did a few hours later.

After that, Sixt kept sending an invoice of 900 euros, every other day, reminding me to make the payment. I always ignored those e-mails. Last week, they sent another invoice, this time 500 euros, as an attempt to settle it.

It seems like they can't just charge my card, otherwise they would have already done so. Should I just keep ignoring them? Or, since I have zero proof, should I take the L and settle with the 500 euro?

TravelHacks,"Dear Reddit-Community,

to be honest, I am pretty desperate and anxious because of this incident and thought, maybe reddit has some good ideas how to proceed.

I have booked a hostel in Fuerteventura during Christmas and New Year’s Eve.

After I had already booked my stay for December I decided to go spontaneously for a short trip at the end of October. I didn’t feel too comfortable in the hostel during my stay and also a bit unsafe as a young girl travelling there alone. (Don't want to go into more detail.)

So when I went back home I tried to reduce my 14days stay in December. So I tried to find a compromise with the hostel via [booking.com](http://booking.com/). Unfortunately the exchange of messages was really strict, not empathetic and no compromise had been offered to me except that I have to pay 168€ as a fee to be able to change anything and then on top the money for the new stay. I don’t have this much money. Even [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) tried to find a solution, but the hostel doesn't reply.

Since the contact on [booking.com](http://booking.com/) was so unfriendly and strict, I feel even more anxious to have to stay at this hostel for 14 days. Unfortunately I don’t have enough money to pay the cancellation fee of 170€ and book another hotel on top. I am aware though, that this may be their booking policy, but was so surprised that they wanted to get that 170Euro fee out of me even though I only wanted to change dates. I never had a hostel this unfriendly.

So I tried to contact [booking.com](https://booking.com/) again and also the hostel. Made some suggestions and basically pleaded for a solution. They sent plenty of unfriendly mails which made me even more anxious. I tried again and again. So after days of not hearing a peep of the hostel I decided to contact a tourist-office on Fuerteventura, ask them for help and put the hostel in cc. (Yes, to provoke a reaction - ain't going to lie.)

Suddenly the owner replied and sent me an email saying ""If you carry on with this you will NOT get a cancellation so stop"". Is he threatening me now? With what though? 

Oke, so on one hand I know that this is also sort of my fault in terms of trying to find a compromise without paying the fees. But on the other hand I am shocked about the behavior of the hostel and how they treat clients, so now I feel like I don't have any choice. And I am honest, I also didn't want to remain silent because I felt like this was and is double unfair: They are unfriendly and threatening, which is why I feel even more unsafe and feeling unsafe is the reason why it's almost inevitable to cancel and give them their money without having anything in return.

My options: Losing 170Euros for nothing? Going to a hostel where I would feel anxious for 14 days about meeting the owner that threatened me? I also don't really understand why the hostel would want to have me over and get a bad review etc. But oke, seems like they sort of want to ""win"" now.

Is there any institution that could help me? What would you do in my position?

Well, genius me read that I could transfer those points to Virgin Flying Club with a limited time bonus of 30%. I turned the 160K into 208K. I thought this was a great idea because Virgin works with Delta. The plan was to use them for a bucket list trip to Machu Picchu with Delta.

Not so fast! Turns out those points are useless because Virgin doesn't fly to South America.  We have also talked about visit Vietnam, but that doesn't work either. I called Chase and Virgin to see if my stupid idea could be reversed. It can't.

* Nature
* Beaches
* Cultural activities

I’m thinking about taking an Amtrak from Trenton, NJ to Cleveland, OH around the holidays on a round trip but can’t decide if it’s worth it. Would love some advice from anybody who has taken Amtrak over flying and what their thoughts were. Here’s my thought process so far:

Pros:
- save anywhere from $100-$200
- can extend my trip since I can work on the Amtrak opposed to plane
- seems to be a more comfortable and relaxing experience than flying 
- a new experience! Haven’t ridden a long distance train since I was a kid, and I’ve grown to despise flying

Cons:
- not 100% sure what to expect
- 15 hour travel time on Amtrak compared to 2-3 hour flight time
- Amtrak would get in to Cleveland in the middle of the night, not sure if I could even rent a car or what my options would be at 3am
- I’d have to make the 15-hour trip twice in the span of 7 days

TravelHacks,"I am lucky enough to be going on a 6-month trip starting this summer, mostly around Europe (I am aware of the Schengen limitations I need to respect). I am kicking this trip off in Belgium because of a friend's wedding. 

Because I'm excited about this trip (a lifelong dream) and because I like to prepare/plan, I have been periodically checking third-party websites for my one-way flight to Belgium with the intention of using the results as a tool to book my flights directly through the airlines. 

Today, I came upon a Very Good PriceTM on Expedia for my flight from home to Brussels (707$), so I toddled over to the airline websites (2 different airlines on Expedia's route) to see if the prices match up and reader, they do not. ONE of the legs of the trip is almost 800$ on the airline website, and the other is 430$, so for the same flight Expedia is quoting me (same dates, same airports, same airlines) booking directly through the airlines would cost me \~1250$. 

I also know the following two things to be true (from experience and this subreddit) : 

1) Third-party websites are a HUGE risk when booking flights ;

2) The ""sweet spot"" to book flights seems to be around the 3-month prior to travel date. 

So my question to you all : do I risk it and pull the trigger on the Expedia flight today at this Very Good PriceTM, or do I wait until April to book my tickets directly through an airline?",Airfare price too good to be true? Advice appreciated!,,Ornery_Fig915,,0,2022-11-06 13:43:26

TravelHacks,"Hi! My girlfriend and I are currently on a road trip along the US east coast. We're using a rental car by Sixt and booked a ""general toll service"" -- a convenience fee that costs us $3 per day and enables us to use automated toll lanes. After reading up on this topic (way too late) we now realize that might have been a waste of money, but we didn't know any better.

Anyway, what bothers me right now, is that I don't even see any kind of transponder in the car for automatically paying up at those EZpass toll stations. Also, when passing the border to Canada, a border control agent told us that their sensors are not picking up on any transponder in our car. We tried calling Sixt about this but they're being very vague in their answers. I worry that we're now stacking up high toll violation fees for every one of the many toll stations we pass without a transponder.

Does anybody have any experience on this, with rental cars in general or, better yet, Sixt specifically? Are we fine with said ""general toll service""? Are there invisible forms of transponders? Or are we indeed missing something and have to reckon with a surprise bill when returning the car?

TravelHacks,"Help! It's been a while since I was up to speed on the best flight search for flexible dates (think Hipmunk as an up-and-comer, that's how out of date I am). In particular, I'm looking for an app or site that will help find flights with the following features:

* Very flexible date ranges -- e.g., +/- 1 month -- this one's the doozy and the **most important** feature for me. I have lots of time; I don't have lots of money. I also don't want to spend all this time on Kayak fiddling with ranges, running endless searches, and then repeating the process every few days/weeks.
* Long international trips across multiple countries.
* Business class strongly preferred (i.e., in case there's some sort of special somewhere), but mixed segments OK. No economy on flights longer than X hours -- the search should be somewhat aware of that.
* Order of destinations is ideally also flexible -- e.g., if I want to go to Paris and Marrakesh, I don't care which one comes first; I care more about cost. This one's less important as a feature.
* I don't want to buy tickets from shady aggregators without customer service, so ideally only direct airline prices are considered by the search.
* I have a vendetta against certain airlines (as do we all), so *ideally* I'd like to exclude them, but this one's not a huge constraint. We all eat crow with airlines at some point or the other.
* I'm willing to skiplag too, so if that's a supported feature, it'd be nice.

I will shamefully admit that my next step is to talk to a human travel agent, but before I go to that desperate measure, is there anything out there on the big wide Internet that will help me do this without talking to a human?

Is the problem that one is taking a seat on a flight that they're not going to use for the final leg thereby screwing another passenger if the flight is full?

My initial thought is that airlines should do a better job of properly pricing their routes that involve multiple legs.

I will be flying from Canada to Gatwick first, where I will spend only maybe a day in the UK and then plan to go to Germany for my first actual destination. After Germany, if I am not too tired, I am heading off to whichever third destination that I can go to - I have some other family in Germany, maybe the plan changes and we do something together; I don't know, because going solo means I am very flexible. 

But I have to get back to London for my last 2 or 3 days because of 2 reasons: I fly back from Gatwick so if I take the train, then it gives time for delays and cancellations to make sure that I am back and able to board my flight back, and the other reason is that I might be interested in checking out the [Mach Loop in Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_Loop), given I am not too tired and can hitch a ride there (Photography is a hobby of mine). 

Here's my approach so far: 

1. I plan to go with 1 carry-on and 1 backpack. I can't be sure that this will be all I need or need a checked bag because I have not yet packed up - my trip is in 1 month, give or take. I know from my family there that flights are getting cancelled like crazy so my plan for the majority of the time there is trains. However, if I can keep these bags to a minimum, maybe I can get a Ryanair or Easyjet instead and get there faster. I know that for these airlines, I have to pay extra for that carry-on, but I don't know if it beats taking the train, **especially from London to mainland Germany**. Do you recommend this approach (bags) ? And do you recommend taking the train or the budget planes? 

2. I checked my telecomm and it seems that they will charge 15 dollars per day to Roam !!!!! Whereas if I get a EU and UK prepaid travel sim card, it will be approximately half that for the time period I am there. I am ordering this sim card from this [website](https://ca.simcorner.com/collections/europe-sim-card/products/europe-uk-sim-card-12gb). Do you think I made the right call ? 

3. Spending with my Canadian credit card abroad means that besides all the usual fees and exchange fees, there is also a BULLSHIT bank fee of 2.5% per transaction (yes, also ATM withdrawals) !!! Fellow Canadians, if you are reading this, CIBC has CANCELLED their Smart Prepaid Travel Cards as of this year , which was on my radar for a long time. Instead, I asked around and someone told me of Wise.com which has a debit card that works with the VISA system and converts CAD to 50 currencies at a rate of almost 0.6% which is amazing and it seemed like the most feasible option among everything else. What do you think about spending with Wise.com Debit card ? 

4. I plan to get Medical Emergency insurance.

5. I am budgeting 5000 CAD for the whole trip *excluding* the price of the plane ticket to and from Gatwick. Is that low or ok ? 

6. I will have accommodation in London and maybe in Hamburg if I ever go there. What do you recommend; airbnb, motel, inn, hotel or couchsurf? 

7. Walking and Public Transportation within the city. No biking and No uber. Thoughts? 

My iterinary thus far: 

- I fly to London, stay a day. 

- I go from London to Berlin, explore a full day. I heard that Berlin is a ghetto city and that they hate the tourists there, so I will just go there to check out the wall and the gate. Is there anything else to see in Berlin while there ? (No, I won't go to Berghain - maybe I will go to the Matrix 😄).

- I go from Berlin to Munich, explore a full day. I have heard a lot of good things about Munich; from a posh lifestyle like Nice or Milan, to historical Nazi buildings that are well-kept for tourism. 

- I go from Munich to Hamburg (maybe), explore a full day. I have a family person there who will be coming from Dusseldorf. I honestly don't know which is better, so I just picked Hamburg, even though it's just a port city. 

- I go from Munich to Country X and City X - TBD. It depends on the answers people give here. I personally was thinking Lisbon, because of how affordable it is. Barcelona because of how hot it (still) is at that time. Milan because of the same reason as Munich. Prague because of the castle everyone keeps taking pictures of. Rome because of the historical importance. 

- I come back to London with 2-3 days to spare just in case. If I have time and someone can give me a ride, I want to go to Wales (from Woking) to see the Mach Loop. Do you know where the locations for the photographers are ? And do you know if the airforce has drills in that time ? Maybe I will ask this in the /r/aviation sub. 


My direct questions to readers:

- Geographically, it would make sense that I can switch up my germany destinations a bit. Dusseldorf (if it is indeed better than Hamburg), is the Eastern most city and closest to France which means the train ride would be faster, but I wasn't sure if Dusseldorf had anything special over Hamburg, so I wanted to ask. 

- Cologne was not on my Radar, but if it has anything special over Hamburg and Dusseldorf, then Cologne it is. Let me know please. 

- Berlin is all the way to the other side of the country. Given that I am doing a one day thing, maybe I will scrap that or push it to the end of my German trip. Is berlin worth keeping on my agenda?

TravelHacks,"Earlier this year, while looking for a NY Global Entry appointment for someone significant, I became frustrated by the inadequacy of available interview appointments. It was a huge inconvenience to keep refreshing the page in the hopes of being lucky.

As per our observation, when an appointment is canceled, it immediately appears on the appointments page; however, due to high demand, the appointments disappear within a fraction of a second. There are several premium alert tools available, with monthly costs ranging from $15 to $25.  Therefore, we developed a tool to optimize and automate this process for ourselves. We were able to arrange for an appointment to take place on the very same day.  From then on, we realized that this tool could benefit many people.

To assist others in saving time and cost, we turned the tool into a website and gave it the name ""TTPTracker.com"". You can consider it your 24-hour personal assistant that updates the appointments page and notifies you when a spot opens up for an appointment. Additionally, it may boost your likelihood of securing an appointment that aligns with your schedule.

**HOW TO USE IT? (We currently support Sound Notification)**

* Go to [https://www.ttptracker.com/](https://www.ttptracker.com/)
* Select your trusted travel program. We currently track the following travel programs: (Global Entry, SENTRI, NEXUS, U.S./Mexico FAST, and U.S./Canada FAST)
* Select country, and the state of location you want to track.
* All locations from the state will appear and you can remove any location you don't want to track. **Note**: multiple locations from various states can be tracked simultaneously.
* Press next and you will appear on the the tracker page. The tracker page updates automatically, without any manual refreshing. Whenever a new appointment becomes available, you will be informed (via sound). Message notification will be added soon.

**DISCORD NOTIFICATIONS: Under development and will be released soon**

This is an early build of the site so you can expect more updates. Due to the high expense of email and SMS notifications, we are still attempting to determine how to enable them. Twitter notification will also be implemented in the near future.

Without any doubt, the 24/7 functionality of this project makes it quite resource-intensive. TTPTracker updates every second, whereas the majority of websites, including those that are paid, only do so every 3 minutes.

# Our objective is to keep the service free! If you'd like to contribute to the project, you can donate here: [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ttptracker](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ttptracker)

&amp;#x200B;

If you find our site useful, feel free to share it with your family and friends so they won't have to waste their time and money.

We have an android (Google pixel ) so I am not sure an airtag would work for me or my partner. I like that even when you are not near the airtag because it is within distance from other iphones it will show you where it is ( meaning you can see if it is on the airplane with you. I have stick on Tile tag that I use for my TV remote that we loose all the time but I have always noticed that it sometimes is outdated with location if I am not super close to it.

Little background information why we are doing checked:We were actually just going to be traveling to Albania to visit family for 5 weeks (partner is from there).  We got very lucky and won a raffle for a free cruise (up to 10 days). we saw one leaving out of Athens and decided it would be the easiest one to get to Albania after the trip (1 hour $86 euro flight).

Our cruise will be in warmer weather than Albania so we will have to pack for multiple climates. we also will be in Albania for 1 month so we always do checked and carry on for gifts bringing there and back to U.S.

My plan for in case the worse happens is trying to pack all of my warmer clothes in carry on and things I could do without in checked bag. We will see how that go's once I am actually packing. I have less than 24 hours between flight landing in Athens to embarkation on the cruise, so I know even if it got left behind there is a chance I would not get it back until once we got back from cruise 7 days later. I do think a tracker would be nice so that I could know if the worst happened id be able to know when it actually did arrive in Athens airport.",best luggage tracker for android user,,lizzlemmonn,,5,2022-08-10 16:37:58

I want to spend winter outside of Europe in some warm place where I could rent a modern flat/bungalow, and so that it's got a beach nearby where I could snorkel, within a walking distance.

I want to be able to walk to the beach any day and snorkel for free. My budget for flat is around 600-700eur per month. 
Bali seems good aswell, but it's a rainy season there during winter
Could you advise me on where I could go please?

This might be a dumb question but I'm starting my Europe trip in Italy and then plan to go north to Venice or Berlin before flying back. But getting flights back seem absurdly expensive. I assume a lot of people traveling to Europe for vacation visit multiple countries, so how do you get around the difference between round trip and one way costs? Or do you really just have to own the extra expenses if you want to do a multi-country visit?

TravelHacks,"I will be taking Emirates with my family in a few months. It’s going to be a long journey and I just got to know about the barclays emirates elite card. It seems by paying $495, I’ll get the gold status and the benefits look decent. Business class lane for check in, business class lounge access for 2 people (my younger one will be free and older one will be charged only half the rate) making the total cost $62.5 + taxes for all of us. 

However, maintaining the card seems to be a totally different ball game. Spending 40k per year to retain gold seems a bit impossible for me. So this will most likely be a 1 year and possibly a 1 trip advantage. 

Is getting the card worth it?

TravelHacks,[removed],A practical guide to travel cheaply around Italy 🇮🇹,,[deleted],deleted,0,2022-08-05 16:08:13
TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,I am an Italian guy who decided to share my way to cheaply travel during my holidays around Italy.In the last years I’ve managed to discover some life hacks, some platforms and some websites that allows you to pay less during a travel. **If you have any suggestions either for Italy or for your own country please post them** so we can increase the number of tips and tricks and always pay less.

**How to travel between cities:** generally I take a car if I have to do a roadtrip. In this case BlaBla car is a must, it is an app that allows you to share a ride with other people, generally if you travel as a driver you can make enough money to pay the tolls and some fuel. If you travel as a passenger it is a great way to go around with very convenient rates. Else if I decide to travel around without a car generally I use Itabus (like Flixbus but a bit cheaper in Italy).Avoid using frecciarossa (very fast trains but very expensive, if you have no other options try to book your train as soon as possible as you might find some promotions)   
Trenitalia is the main train company in Italy, although most of the times Itabus is cheaper.

**How to visit a city:**  I usually go in a zone with free parking (in the city center parking is almost never free) and from there I move using rented bikes (most of the big cities have a cheap service of bike sharing with options for 7 days renting at very affordable prices, TObike for Turin, BikeMi for Milan, Roma bike sharing for Rome and so on… you can just type on google “name of the city + bikesharing“). Another way is to use free floating bike sharing service like Helbiz, Ridemovi and so on. However this last option is much more expensive in respect to the aforementioned services. Check also for public transport, I honestly don’t like it but if you don’t mind it have a look.Avoid taxi at all cost!Pay attention to ZTL: in some cities you cannot enter in the city center with your car, there are cameras at the entrance of the ZTL and you will receive a fine! (Check on google “name of the city + ZTL” in order to see the hours and the places forbidden)

**How to fuel your car:** There is an app called “Prezzi benzina“. It is an app developed by the government, it allows you to have a somewhat updated map of all the prices of the fueling pump around you. The app is very ugly but functional and useful.

**How to eat and drink:** I usually take with me a small camping stove and some utensils. You can cook almost everywhere, I’ve cooked in public parks, near churches, in playgrounds and other places… nobody cares if you cook something fast, maybe try to cook in a place not very crowded nor in front of the police however I’ve never had any problems. Try to be clean and responsible.You can find drinkable water in playgrounds, city centers, or if you type “fontana potabile”, “punto acqua“ on google maps. The water in the bathrooms in Italy is drinkable, you can top up your water bottle at any caffè or any restaurant with a bathroom.If you want to have a nice dinner at a restaurant try to ask someone that lives in the city you are visiting, I’ve always had very great suggestions. Also Tripadvisor can help you

**How to sleep:** There is a very nice platform called Garden sharing, there you can book private gardens to place your tent at very low prices (15-20€ per night for two people, a car and a tent), since you are in a private garden you usually can also use the shower, electricity, bathroom and so on…If you have a mobile home or you sleep in your car you can use Park4night or Ioverlander to find suitable parking spot. On IOverlander you can also find sleeping places for tents, showers, drinkable water, interesting attraction and much more, always look if there is something particular around you!Of course Airbnb and other similar services remain viable options.

**How to find interesting places:** Talk with whoever you meet, they are going to give you great suggestions for free! Also search for “scenic spot“ on google maps.If you tap on the name of a city on google maps it will give you a rapid overview of the city with a lot of photos, if you find a photo interesting you can find from there the place where it was taken.Look for point of interest in IOverlander.

Many museum or tourists attraction allows you to have discounts if you go to an university, however they usually do not check carefully the university card that you are showing . Either you can bring with you the university card of a friend or you can show a random card that can be similar to a university card and generally you can receive the discount. The same applies for some supermarkets, you can ask for university discount when you are about to pay.",A practical guide to travel cheaply in Italy,,Sufficient-Basil-209,,7,2022-08-05 16:05:56

Sparing you the details, my girlfriend and I have had some rather difficult years mentally these past three years. However, it’s been getting much better lately and we’ve gotten really excited for traveling together this summer! We’re thinking of riding by train through Europe (using Interrail) and are mostly looking into accommodations within reasonable distance to a nice beach, but we’d also love to have some cities, landmarks, museums or cultural sites to see in the vicinity. 

Since my girlfriend has been aching to go there for years now, we’re thinking of visiting Italy and the last couple of days we’ve been hyping up the area around Naples, Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast. We’ve especially had our eyes on Salerno, since it seems to have great railway connections and the aforementioned beach. Also, our budget isn’t the greatest, and it seems like Salerno could be a little less expensive than some of its neighboring cities. However, we’ve gotten a little worried over the fact that we can’t find much at all written about the town, so now we’re getting a little unsure.

If anyone’s more knowledgeable than us we’d love to hear about it! Do you recommend Salerno or any other coastal towns or places to stay in the Naples and Amalfi area? Or do you know of a completely different place in Italy that you think could fit us? Do you have any tips or tricks for finding food and housing on a budget? Or just some tips in general for staying in Italy?

TravelHacks,"Hi! I’ve visited Portugal every summer since I was born. My mother is from Serra Da Estrella and my dad is from the Viseu area &lt;3 We have a home in Figueira but spend a lot of time in Coimbra. 

Usually my father or brother drive when we visit. They can drive a manual car. BUT I’m bringing my fiancé to Portugal for the first time in 2 weeks to meet my family and he can only drive an automatic car. Europcar in Figueira can’t guarantee an automatic, even though our rental agreement is for an automatic. I called today and they recommend I call 2 days before we pick up the car to see what they have available. I’m skeptical. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or experience renting an automatic vehicle in Portugal/Europe? Has anyone had success? Will we have better luck with a different company?

TravelHacks,"Hi Everyone,

I always see people talk about how you can go volunteer abroad and the organisation will pay for your food, accommodation, flights etc and all you have to do is volunteer for some of the day and then you can explore the area in your spare time etc but whenever I look for companies like this, they charge you money to volunteer, are there any companies which will actually pay for everything for you to volunteer abroad? 

I'm on summer holiday so only looking for something that's 1-4 weeks long to be honest.

I've also heard about people getting jobs on cruise ships or as air cabin staff which would be great but can you join their staff just for a month and then leave? Do they have any temporary roles where you could do thay?

I'd appreciate any help! I'm a university student in England, trying to see some of the world either for free or work abroad for a few weeks. I don't mind volunteering or working, just don't have big money to spend at the moment but still want to do something with my summer.

I will be traveling to France and want to use an eSIM for a local carrier (Orange). I'm hoping my seasoned TravelHacks friends can help answer a question about locked SIMs and eSIMs. 

My iPhone Xr was paid off long ago, so it should be unlocked. When I check my iPhone Settings&gt;General&gt;About&gt;Carrier Lock says, ""SIM Locked""

I contacted Verizon and they said they turned the lock off, and I got a text message from them that says, ""Once you put a non-Verizon SIM card into this device, it'll be unlocked for use on other carrier networks.""

After more than an hour, Settings still says ""SIM Locked.""

TravelHacks,"When you're traveling, there are two options for drying off after taking a swim or a shower at a hostel:

a. **Bring your own towel.** This takes up a ton of storage space, you have to hang it for several hours, you have to find a place to dry it (bunkbed ladders, windows, etc.) and it never really dries out entirely

b. **Rent a towel.** Hostels oftentimes charge $5-$10 just to rent a towel. This saves you the baggage space, but there's no guarantee you'll get a clean towel, and you still have to find a place to dry it out.

Enter: **The Chamois**

Everyone's familiar with ShamWow, but this is 100x better. Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) is *extremely* absorbent, it's portable, it's reusable, and it dries out insanely quickly. When it dries out, it hardens into a cardboard-like material making it easy to pack.

Professional swimmers and divers use chamois to dry themselves, and it's also commonly found in car washes. Usually, I cut mine in half with a pair of scissors because you really don't need much surface area to dry yourself. A small square is more than enough.

My favorite brand: The Absorber. I bought mine at Target in the Car/Automotive aisle

[https://www.amazon.com/CleanTools-149-Natural-Single-Absorber/dp/B0000AY69V](https://www.amazon.com/CleanTools-149-Natural-Single-Absorber/dp/B0000AY69V)

TravelHacks,"This November, my wife and I will take our first ever trip to the US from Europe, as we're going to my cousin's wedding in Nevada. While the ceremony, all related events, and the party will be done in three days, we're looking forward to a short stay, as we'll probably book an Airbnb for about two weeks and buy plane tickets after arriving.

&amp;#x200B;

While we can manage most of our preparations for this trip, and we'll stay at my cousin the first night or two, we'd still like to know what kind of health insurance we should get during our stay. Do we contact insurers in our country for lower prices but relatively small payouts and hope we don't need them (it's as low as $35/month here), or do we look into specific plans or packages in the US?

&amp;#x200B;

When going through some healthcare plans in the US, I've read about the [Medigap Plan F](https://www.medigap.com/medicare-supplements/medigap-plan-f/), which is described as the """"Cadillac"""" of healthcare plans, at least in this article. It involves zero cost-sharing after paying a monthly premium, and we'd like something similar for our stay, so we pay a bit more for total security in case something goes wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm not a US citizen and don't plan on staying there for longer than two weeks or even moving there one day, and we also don't necessarily have the largest budget for a healthcare plan, I'd like to find something similarly all-encompassing for temporary medical insurance in the US. This would mean we can be as stress-free as possible, especially after reading all the scary stories and urban legends about people losing their livelihoods just because they didn't have a good plan in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'd like to hear some suggestions and recommendations for insurance companies and short-term healthcare plans for visitors to the US.

TravelHacks,"TLDR: What are some scams or tourist traps you have seen while traveling? I'm curious to see what some of you have seen. 

What comes to my mind: 

1. How in many Mexican/Caribbean airports there are ""travel"" stands and salespeople who try to convince you they are associated with your hotel, but really are a timeshare company. I had one of my friends who went on her honeymoon and her/spouse were kind of ""adultnapped"" and brought to a random location for a timeshare meeting. These salespeople are super convincing. 

2. Also in Mexico/Caribbean how hotels will tell you they have a ""free gift"" and try to talk to you about timeshares for an hour. Or, similarly they say your breakfast is free if you sit through an hour meeting etc. 

3. So many in Rome, but one being the large amount of scammers selling fake tickets outside the Colosseum.

4. Paris, where gypsies will masquerade as metro/subway/train attendants and try to help tourists get a ticket, charging an extra fee. 

5. Everywhere, where someone selling roses will try to set one on your table or try to ""give"" you a flower and then come back later trying to charge. 

6. Basically everything in Bali. Walking outside the airport and having to hold onto your luggage for dear life because there are so many men trying to help you take your luggage to a car/bus and trying to charge you for this fee. 

I think there are more, but these are the first things that come to my mind. So many of these people above are just trying to make money to better their lives, but at the tourists expense of course.

TravelHacks," Hi! My gf and I have been traveling around Europe for the past 156 days. Over that time period, we have used a lot of different apps and websites to discover things to do and see. I am hoping to start a discussion where we can share a few of our favorite/most used travel apps or resources!

Wikivoyage: [https://www.wikivoyage.org/](https://www.wikivoyage.org/) My personal favorite and also one of my most used. A lot of useful info for everything you need to know about getting to/from/inside of a new country. As well as a few recommendations for things to try.

Organic Maps: This map app is based on OpenStreetMaps and is a fork from [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) If you didn't know [maps.me](https://maps.me/) was purchased by a payment company and since has become bloated and the philosophy seems to have changed. Organic Maps goes back to what made [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) so amazing in the first place. Download maps for offline use, pin and categorize things you see/visit, and is very lightweight.

HiChee: [https://hichee.com/](https://hichee.com/) Check if the Airbnb or [booking.com](https://booking.com/) listing you are interested in is listed on another platform. It shows the price on all available platforms and can save you some money! I just recently discovered this and have already saved a bit of money!

I am in no way affiliated with any of these websites/products. Just an avid traveler who wants to make traveling more accessible for everyone!

TravelHacks,"This is for UA, at least. Had a flight booked for yesterday from BOS-DEN, coming home to complete a work trip. I booked it a few weeks ago, paid about $1050 (am too lazy to look up exact numbers but they don't matter for this aside from the fact that the ticket was expensive) and submitted that for reimbursement.  


Last week I decided to check out different return flight options as i was booked on 6:15am and didn't really want to get up that early. Went into my United app, chose the flight and went to see what options there for changing the flight and I saw that I could move to the 7:35am flight for $130 flight credit so I started that process but the app froze so I called in and agent finished it for me, so great, I get more sleep AND $130 flight credit, cool.   


Fast forward an hour and I get back on the app and I see that I can move back to the 6:15am and upgrade to business for $88 so I figure why not? I'll sit in the big seats so I have a much better chance of sleeping so that will mitigate the early hour. Tap, tap, tap, and I'm in first class on my original flight, cool.

Fast forward again. Go back into the app, select my flight, look at changing flight options and I can go back to the 7:35am for a $269 flight credit!!! Tap tap tap and the app froze, so I called the Premier desk and an agent made the change for me.   


So, for probably 8-10 minutes on the phone, less on the app, and $88 of my money I got to sleep an hour later and still got back to DEN in the morning, plus I now have $399 in shiny new flight credits.   


If you bought tickets in the past six weeks and have upcoming trips during which you aren't super tied to a schedule, it's worth the time to poke around at changing those flights, as prices are ticking down right now.

TravelHacks,"I stupidly booked some flights with kiwi.com (I know) and my departure flight was delayed by 5 hours and 20 minutes. Due to other issues and the delay, I decided not to go on the flight as I had already read on the Wizzair website, as well as citizens advice, that if a flight is delayed by over 5 hours then I am legally entitled to a full refund. Anyone who is familiar with kiwi.com can probably guess that I have been able to get absolutely nowhere with them. I have no other option now than to call my bank and request a chargeback. 

I was certain that the bank would decide in my favour, however, upon reading the citizens advice website closer, I can see that it states that ‘airlines’ are required to provide full refunds. Kiwi.com is a third party booking service so I am unsure if they fall under this too? I paid £216 for my tickets on kiwi.com and when I looked for my invoice on Wizzair.com, my total had only come to £67 so the rest of that money was simply their fees! Would I be entitled to receiving the whole £216 back or only £67 as that is technically how much the ‘airline’ charged me.

&amp;#x200B;

TIA in advance for your patience with a worried traveler with OCD needing details on how things work, and your help.

&amp;#x200B;

We are planning on arriving at MCO 3 hours early. Is the process the same as it is for domestic flights, or because our travel is taking us to Belize, are there other things that need to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

When we land in Miami, I'm assuming our luggage will be transferred for us as the flights were bought on the same ticket? If not, how does that work, because that would mean leaving the secured area, waiting for the bags, going to recheck the bags, and going back through security. It's a 3 hour layover, if everything is on time; but we'd like to have time to eat and relax a little.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, is there anything special we have to do when we deplane in Miami? The airport shows both flights from the same concourse, so that's one thing less to worry about.     


We go through customs in Belize? How does that work?

When we return, it's the same process in reverse? Is there a special screening or anything before we board in Belize? Do we go through customs back in the US in Miami or Orlando?  Do we stop and get our bags in Miami, and then check them again to go to Orlando?

Another one of my cousins jokingly asked how much money it would take for me to live in Iran with them.

TravelHacks,"For over 3 times now, I've been ""randomly"" checked at the airport in my home country (never had problems abroad). They keep saying it's ""random"" and I know they won't ever tell why, but I for sure know they have a criteria for this since ""random"" has been 3 times. Once was even me traveling with my dad - kind of makes me feel unwelcome in my own country for being checked like this. They even write my passport number and name in a small sheet.. and I'm scared it affects my future travels? They don't really dig to my luggage/bag, but they do check what's in it, and I also have to do a 360 degree turn in an x-ray (?). I'm well-travelled as well (multiple passport stamps), neatly-dressed, etc. So not sure why I always get selected.

Just really curious, thoughts?

I called Turkish airlines to ask about this, if there is a possibility to change the departure date to somewhere around a month later,but they say that it isn't a possibility and state that i have to pay 5300 USD to change the flight.

Is there anything i can do about this situation? i have all necessary documents proving that i am having the operation.

TravelHacks,"I'm finally going on a proper vacation to Egypt with my girlfriend in August, after 4 years since I last left my country (central Europe).

&amp;#x200B;

The hotel we're staying at is nice and close to the sea, and I've already paid for the first half of the week, with the total coming to about 700 euros. The plane trip included, it's already gone over 1000 euros total. I'd really like to return home with some money left. Hence, a budget of about 200-300 euros is the most I can allow myself to spend without crippling myself financially (and I hope my GF chips in, too, but I don't plan on asking her to split everything 50/50).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for tips and a general strategy for saving money abroad. I can't use the same tricks to cut expenses and avoid spending more than I earn at home. General tips like """"cook instead of going to restaurants"""" or """"walk instead of taking local taxis"""" are welcome, but I'd love to hear more ideas on how to both have a great week in Egypt with my GF and live off a budget of about 200-300 euros.

&amp;#x200B;

One idea I had in mind is finding the most interesting yet cheapest tourist attractions, with the closest city being a 40 minutes bus drive away. I've already found museums with cheap entries (or free for a student, my GF) and some free outdoor activities.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I do quite often, which is why I managed to save up to 1500 euros during the last year in the first place, is using discounts and offers, which I find through sites that discover online coupons. I've already found this [Noon code](https://almowafir.com/en/store/noon/), which is a prominent chain in that part of the world, and I plan on finding more, so we get the food and other things we'll need locally with large discounts.

&amp;#x200B;

We're planning on buying Orange Mobile's Holiday plan and having the SIM Cards sent to us in the USA, but we're curious if they're the best provider for that, or if there are better ways to go about getting the cards locally, and if other carriers are preferable. I've had multiple people tell me to purchase at the airport we arrive in, which would be either Barcelona (for our 3 hour layover) or Venice (our true first destination). We'd love any advice you have to offer, but please keep in mind that, if there's a good way to have our SIMs before we leave, it's the most preferable route.

TravelHacks,"Hi,

We flew home from Norway, transitting via Oslo, back to Gatwick on Tuesday. With Norwegian Airlines.

Our baby car seat did not make it. I filed a Property Irregularity Report (there was no staff member on the desk). There has been no update on the 'track missing backage' report, so the seat still shows as missing (on the out leg a different bag was mislaid, and it was updated to 'found, rerouting' within hours).

My understanding is that the airline won't compensate for items on the home leg. But what about needed items, of which you only have one. We legally need a car seat for journeys here, and sooner or later, we're going to 'need' to take a car journey. And don't want to wait 21 days or so, until the seat is officially declared lost!

TravelHacks," Hi! 

Link to Full Budget Breakdown: [https://imgur.com/a/R1hG1Ue](https://imgur.com/a/R1hG1Ue)

My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have been traveling for the past 148 days. Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a tight budget! We each have a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This is just one person's spend and we split basically everything.

I'd love to answer any questions about the budget/destinations/travel planning/etc. Any questions you may have feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

Some detail about the categories:

Accommodation - Airbnb/Booking.com is our primary accommodation provider but we do stay in hostels \~30% of the time.

Activities - Museums, Walking Tours, Castles, Bobsled Runs (Sigulda, Latvia is awesome btw), National Parks, etc.

Coffee - This is just coffee from cafes. 90% of the time I drink horrible instant coffee at the accommodation.

Food - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100gb of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for at least half of the countries).

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas

Travel - This is anything that takes from one city or country to another. Ex. Bus from Slovakia to Croatia, Train from Mostar to Sarajevo in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.

Countries Visited:

1. Estonia
2. Latvia
3. Lithuania
4. Poland
5. Czech Republic

TravelHacks,"I just made a reservation with Alamo for a one-way rental going from NYC metro to Bozeman, MT for this August.  Out of curiosity I checked the price for a in-town rental of the same car and dates.  It turns out returning locally would cost twice as much as one-way.  My reservation is with a neighborhood location, so I checked the airport location.  It's the same case there: one-way is half the cost.  There must be an acute shortage of rental cars in Bozeman?

Both my neighborhood and airport Alamo are co-branded with National Car Rental, since I have nothing better to do, I also checked National's price for the same car and dates, for one-way and local rentals.  To my surprise, while the airport National is the same thing (one-way is half the price)), the neighborhood National is the other way around: one-way costs twice as much.

To summarize, compared to in-town rentals:

* Neighborhood Alamo: One way is half the price
* Neighborhood National: One way is 2x more expensive
* Airport Alamo: One way is half the price
* Airport National: One way is half the price

Isn't National and Alamo essentially the same company?  When co-located, they must be administered together, maybe even sharing the same vehicle pool.  I didn't expect price to move in opposite directions by simply switching brands.

Not sure what magic is working behind the scenes, I thought this is interesting.","One-way car rental is cheaper, sometimes?",,wcbhkids,,4,2022-07-22 16:52:47

TravelHacks,"Hi there, I am going to be taking a long haul flight in the near future, and I've read that the seat I'll be sitting in has almost no padding.  I've experienced this before, and it has made for a very unpleasant flight.  This time I'd prefer to be prepared with a portable seat cushion, and I was wondering if anyone could provide some advice.  I recently purchased a latex mattress after quite a lot of research on how latex compresses vs memory foam vs other foams vs springs vs pillow stuffing and so on.  Accordingly, I'm starting to wonder if firm latex might be suitable for a seat cushion.  I know latex is good at conforming and providing progressive support as it compresses, I'm just not sure if it would be able to do so with such a concentrated pressure as is created by sitting rather than laying down.  Has anyone had experience with something like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I've also need a lot of discussion about Purple pads.  They seem to be very aggressively marketed towards office use and trucking.  They appear to be foam grids that allow for very good breathability.  I imagine that something like this \*might\* work ok, and may be a bit lighter than latex.

&amp;#x200B;

I think probably an inflatable is going to be just about the worst option, and I'm pretty leery of memory foam as well - I just don't think it'll provide proper resistance / support.

TravelHacks,"I booked a hotel with Agoda in January. The booking confirmation states a EUR amount but in fine print (which I didn't see at the time), it says the money will be converted to my local currency (DKK) at Agoda exchange rates. Well, now the day came when Agoda was to charge the money, and lo-and-behold, they charge +17% on top of the official exchange rate! I've never experienced anything like this. I thought it must be a mistake or related to city taxes or something, even though the confirmation stated the price was including all taxes (even listing the specific amounts). I contacted their customer support and they said it was due to the currency conversion. They referred to the statement that it would get converted to DKK. There was no way to pay the amount in euro, even though the euro amount is the only amount shown. Also, nowhere do they state that they add a +17% surcharge on the official conversion fee. I tried to insist it must be a mistake, but they were unyielding. They just advised me I could cancel the booking. Trouble is, rebooking with another site would be much more expensive - there's a reason I booked 6 months in advance!

I have only one word for this: Fraud. Even if they write that they are going to convert to DKK, there's no way they have the right to add 17% on top.

Update: They ended up offering to halve the conversion fee which is still unacceptably high. They also tried to claim that 17% were listed in the booking confirmation or app (""just press more details"") which it wasn't, it wasn't listed anywhere. When I told them they stopped writing about this and wouldn't comment when I asked why they said it was listed.

**Bottom line, there's no way for customers to compare Agoda prices with other sites since they operate with a secret system of outrageous conversion fees (17%). It's not a mistake (from their point of view), it's what they actually do! Don't go anywhere near them, even if they come up as the cheapest in a search engine.**",Don't book with Agoda - they are scammers,,ShoeStatus2431,,55,2022-07-19 07:27:49

TravelHacks,"Hello fellow travelers, I am soon going to be traveling to the USA. I live in Germany and I've never been outside of the EU which is why I am currently facing a dilemma regarding a fitting data plan for my phone/a portable wifi hotspot. I've been researching data plans and different kinds of portable wifi hotspots for a few hours now and I think I am more confused than before because there is so much contradictory information about it out there that I am turning to Reddit for some definite answers based on your guys' personal experience.

As I understand there are 3 options for me and my family now if we all want to have decent cellular internet. 


1. 1 big data plan so that one of us shares a mobile hotspot with the others
2. A data plan where everyone has their separate sim card that they use in their phones but all are connected to the same account thus also using the same data cap
3. A portable wifi hotspot that also uses a big data plan 

There are certain pros and cons to all of the options here but I feel like I don't have all the information nor the experience to argue which one is the best/most convenient/cheapest option. I can't be the first person ever to be facing this dilemma which is why I am hoping that one of you guys has some magical traveling life hack that works perfectly for me and my family.

I would love it if anyone has any sort of recommendation for me but what's most intriguing to me is option 3 because it was all the benefits from option 1 without the hassle of having your phone battery drained because of the mobile hotspot. Sadly I know too little to decide which one to get and if anyone can recommend a device that supports USA and Europe sim cards with decent battery size and internet bandwidth I would highly appreciate it.

Sorry if this whole post is incoherent but this is a last ditch effort to get this whole thing sorted out because I thought it would be way easier and it's now already only 1 week until the flight to Florida and I have yet to get something to work. 

Thanks everyone in advance for the recommendations.",Best cellular data solution for traveling to the USA,,XayahProdigy,,3,2022-07-18 16:02:50

TravelHacks,"My family were going on a two week trip to the U.K. The first week was going to be in Cornwall, and the second week was going to be in St.Albans. We booked airline tickets, a rental car, and several hotels along the way. 
Unfortunately my wife had a medial emergency the week prior to our departure, and we were unable to make the journey.  Virgin was able to refund the tickets (with a note from the doctor), Enterprise refunded the car, and all of the hotels were able to refund the days that we had booked….well, almost. The majority of the stay in Cornwall was going to be at the Old Chapel in St. Just. It was booked through booking.com as a non-refundable booking, and that is exactly what we got. No refund of any portion.
It was a huge chunk of our vacation budget (after the airline tickets), but they play by the bookings.com rules, and will not offer any sort of refund, even due to medical emergencies.
They are legally in their right to do this (although personally I prefer to do business with places that value relationships as much as contracts).

My family had overcome 3 Covid cases, 2 Flu-A cases (despite vaccinations for both), a new adopted daughter that we had to get social security cards, ID, and passport for in order to go on this trip. We thought we had finally made it until my wife needed knee surgery.

If you are traveling anytime soon, with the state of travel, and pandemic, please…I repeat please….get some travel insurance, or make sure that your bookings are refundable. The VRBO and AirB&amp;B folks can’t survive without bookings, and based on my emails with the Old Chapel, they don’t have the financial stability to refund any money that they do not have to legally.",Be Very Aware of Non-Refundable Bookings,,WorstJugglerEver,,7,2022-07-18 00:07:31

TravelHacks,"I'm reaching the end of my study abroad program in Germany and will be moving back to the US in a couple weeks. However, the flight I booked has a stopover at Schiphol (Amsterdam), where they've been having an insane shortage of staff and as a result have been losing/misplacing [literally hundreds of suitcases](https://nltimes.nl/2022/07/15/2000-suitcases-remain-abandoned-schiphol-airport), so my parents are advising me to ship 2 of my 3 suitcases by mail, instead of checking them in at the airport. 

I've been eyeing [https://www.sendmybag.com/](https://www.sendmybag.com/) as an option, but I'm a little skeptical because I had never heard of them until my Google deep dive. I also don't love the fact that they only do pickup and do not offer a pickup time more specific than between 9 am and 6 pm,,, and I'd really rather enjoy my last days of Germany out in the city than waiting at home for up to 9 hours. 

I can't really tell from the DHL website if they will ship a fabric-sided (though still rectangular) suitcase, but it will no doubt be expensive--I just paid for the shipping of one 10 kg cardboard box back to the States and it was 78 euros. I assume my suitcase will be much more than 10 kg. 

Any advice? Or do you think I should risk it and check in my suitcases? I'm not sure how much of the baggage chaos is affecting those who only have a transfer at Schiphol and aren't going through security or baggage claim or anything.

I have also always wanted a true side hustle that would earn me passive income, but also be worth my time. I do journal a lot of my trips on social media and all my friends tell me I should be a travel writer/blogger because they feel I can make a legit living doing that. My income requirements are quite high though which affords me the traveling I do. However, I am open to doing something travel related as a side hustle.

I am curious if there are any travel agents/advisors that can share advice on if it makes sense to become my own travel agent. I have not used a travel agent for any of my trips because I am truly fluid when traveling and don't often stick to a rigid itinerary and don't backtrack to the same place making my trip a little complicated to explain to a trip planner.

I pride myself on finding the less explored, off-the-beaten-path places and am very thrifty with my online research and bookings which is why I never felt the need to hire a travel agent myself. I also felt like I had a better pulse on things than they did.

Would I save money by becoming my own travel agent?  
Would I become even more educated about booking travel by becoming a travel agent?

I need to be in the San Francisco Bay Area for a very, very important birthday which is on July 31st, so I'd have to arrive late on the 30th at the latest. The problem is that I can't really leave Munich before about 8pm on July 29th, so I am not very flexible when it comes to departure dates.   
I will have to be back in Germany on September 3 at the latest.  
I have spent hours and hours in the past week comparing different cheap-flight-finder-websites and trying all kinds of wild combinations like finding the cheapest flight from anywhere in Germany or even other close by European airports (which I could reach by train on the 30th) to anywhere in the US and then looking for a cheap domestic flight to SFO, but even after endless searching and considering absolute nightmare connections (eg. a 17 hour layover in Amsterdam starting at 9pm..), I can't seem to find anything cheaper than 1300 $ roundtrip, which is more than I can afford.   
Do any of the veteran budget travellers here have tips for what else I could try? I am tempted to wait a little longer and count on price fluctuations, but I am getting nervous as my departure date is approaching fast.

My $222 rental went from $666 (which also triggered a HARD PASS from me).

She showed me the fine print of the rental agreement, which was in Spanish and outlined the mandatory fees. My qualm was that the specific rental agreement was not disclosed via Hopper because this was a prepaid “mystery” deal.

She has this Freedom Mobile prepaid $99 for 6 months plan and in order to use it in Quebec, data is $15/GB (so basically, 1GB of data costs as much as 1 month's phone bill).

Fortunately, her phone is an iPhone 13, which supports eSIM dual-SIM features. So, all she really needs is a Quebec-only, data only plan that lasts for the duration of the trip (1 week). Based on her usage, 2GB for the week is more than enough. That is because while she has data from somewhere, she can use said data to enable all the features of the current Freedom Mobile plan (unlimited talk and text).

I'm a hobbyist motorsports photographer.  In november 2021, I booked flights through Chase Ultimate Rewards from CLT to LAX to shoot the inaugural NASCAR event in early Feb 2022.  Ended up having to cancel as my credential request was denied.  I booked at a time when costs were pretty low compared to today.

TravelHacks,"Hey guys!

My friends and I are doing a challenge this weekend and I'd love to get some feedback from you guys.

Here's the prompt.

We have from Friday (7/15/22) morning until 3 pm to plan. We're starting from Portland, ME. We need to be back by Monday (7/18/22) at 10 am. We have 140k amex/delta points and around $1k budget for the 3 of us.

Our goal is to collect as many incredible stories as possible within those constraints. We assume that's going to require some real roughing it / energy exertion to fit more than even one thing into that time frame.

But, we believe that it's possible with a combination of clever planning and finding the coolest things to do on a not-huge budget.

So, my question for you is: what should we do? Do you have any cool spots / experiences / tips to recommend? Here are some of the things we've been looking at:

* Spelunking
* Spear Fishing
* Sky diving
* Flying a float plane (I'm a student pilot)
* Salt flats
* Feeding Tarpons at Robbies of Islamorada
* Beating a world record
* Driving a tank
* Operating construction equipment
* Falconry
* Musical Highway in NM
* Pando the Quivering Aspen
* Great Northeastern War
* Meow Wolf
* Indian Pow Wow
* Hot Air Balloon Festival
* Sidewalk Chalk Festival

We have some more too, but these are the big ones. We're having trouble researching this since it's such a specific prompt.

We're not really looking for suggestions of cute towns or beautiful national parks. I'm a sucker for both, but it doesn't really fit in the spirit of the trip. We have some hikes in mind but we're worried about how much of our small amount of time that would take. Plus we're probably not going to have tons of time for showers and extra clothes so getting sweaty and needing hiking gear is probably out of the question.

We really would love off of the beaten path types of experiences. Totally not a requirement though.

Time and travel are big factors that need to be considered, but we'd also love to cover as wide of a travel range as possible. But still, only lower 48 is possible because of time constraints. And no foreign countries because one of my buddies doesn't have a passport.

Do you guys have anything you think would be fun for us to do? I'd love to hear any and all suggestions!",I could really use your help for a little challenge I'm doing with my friends this weekend,,kidhotel,,1,2022-07-14 14:14:57

Last Wednesday I flew from Manhattan, KS, USA to Hamburg, Germany with American Airlines and Lufthansa. All my flights left as planned, so Thursday evening, I made it to Hamburg. My luggage however, didn't. I checked in 3 bags with American Airlines at my first Airport (MHK), and I was assured that those were checked through all the way to Hamburg. In Hamburg, I then had to realise, that my suitcases were missing. 

Of course, I immediately filed a report at the baggage tracking center there. I was told that the Suitcases probably were still in Frankfurt, since I only had an hour layover there in between my transatlantic and my domestic flight. I was sure that they w arrive shortly after, but they didn't. I then called Lufthansa again, and was told that they couldn't be found in their system, and that I would be notified as soon as they appeared in their system. 

I wanted to make sure that they made it  to Lufthansa in the first place so I called American Airlines, where I was told that the transfer to Lufthansa was successful, on 1am on Thursday, where I had already left the country with my plane. 

Since then I've been waiting to get notified on when they get to Frankfurt, but obviously I haven't yet. I've filed the  list of the items inside each suitcase like I was told, and just am very curious as to what you guys think. Are my suitcases gonna be send to Frankfurt sometime soon? Will I get them back?

However, I do want to conquer the fear (and say fuck you to DR) and maximize this tool for travel. Ideally I want to plan a major trip once a year, with smaller trips sprinkled throughout the year.

I have looked up NerdWallet and other recs for travel cards but I find the terminology confusing and I am not sure I would travel enough for a card with an annual fee.

I am interested in 360 cameras for their freedom in perspective view and to be creative in general. But I want to purchase an action camera, and Hero9 is looking solid there (Hero10 + accessories may go out of budget).

I am leaning towards One X2 in 360° cameras, because it's 25% cheaper than GoPro Max (at least in India). But GoPro is known for its toughness and I am not that much of a careful person. I am concerned for the fragility of One X2.

So say that I want to book a flight for September from JFK to LHR. If I were to book one now, fares for economy are at least $900 USD for a direct flight. But under my mom's theory, if I were to wait until August to book for a trip in autumn, the fares for a direct flight would be around half that, maybe $500-600 USD.

TravelHacks,[removed],Tips for a couple of Art Nerds on our first trip to Italy?,,GlitchSketch,moderator,0,2022-07-09 05:33:34
TravelHacks,"Spousling and I are going to Italy, Sept 2022 - first time for both of us. *Eeee! So excite!*  We're big art nerds, especially me. (When I went to Paris I spent TWO FULL DAYS in the Pompidou Center).   
Our travel style is to settle into a place and dig deep into it, vs bouncing around to ""see all the sights."" 

Looking for all kinds of tips, but especially help narrowing down what neighborhoods to look in for hotel/airbnbs. We're a little older and okay with spending some money for cool &amp; interesting, but not interested in ""luXeRy"" just for the sake of fancy-pantsy. Convenience in getting to Biennale sites, and to not be too exhausted at the end of the day, but totally fine with figuring out local public transit and things like that. I like taking Metro in cities I've never been in. 

Very rough plan involves flying into Rome, 2 days there, including day trip by train to Niki de St. Phalle sculpture park. Then train to Venice. Five or Six days in Venice, then train to Florence. A day or two in Florence, seeing all the buildings I flunked in Architecture school exams, then back to Rome to fly home.  

Is it important to book train travel early? Museum tickets? What neighborhoods are good for art nerds to stay in?  What questions am I forgetting to ask?

TravelHacks,"I've got a  trip coming up, and I had initially made a reservation for a ""Premium Elite SUV"" (BMW X3 or similar) at \~$100 per day. I got a 5% discount for being a member of Enterprise's loyalty program, and I figured that was good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I decided to check if my USAA membership would get me a better discount. I saw that the ""Executive Luxury SUV"" (Range Rover Sport, Porsche Cayenne, Mercedes Benz GL450, or similar) option was \~$200 per day on the Enterprise app but \~$100 per day after logging in through USAA. I changed my reservation, thinking I was getting a 50% discount.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm not half-asleep and sitting at my desk actively avoiding work, I see that the difference between the vehicle classes on a standard web browser is only about one dollar. Premium Elite SUV is up to $111 now, and it was $100 when I started writing this post about 30 minutes ago. However, as I log in to the Enterprise website repeatedly, the prices keep changing even though I use the same pickup and drop-off location, date, and time. I don't necessarily have the time or desire to fire up my VPN and launch a private browsing session to see if the prices change, but I feel they might. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: is this common? The considerable price difference between the website and app. The price changes on the website with every new search even though none of the reservation details change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I keep checking back to see if the price drops significantly and re-book it if it does, or is $100 per day a good enough deal for the Executive Luxury SUV? Any tips or tricks you can share to get a better deal, or a better car, would be very much appreciated.

- Any products for long term travel you didn't expect to use a lot? 
- improving my Spanish (like forcing myself to use my Spanish, and I'm a little nervous for the first month of being there)
- group dynamics (how does my group get on the same page for travelling together, budget, expectations, etc; I've never done anything like this and I'm not sure the best way to make sure we are all on the same page) 
- planning weekend trips (unfortunately, I can't make my class schedule until I get there in August, and even then I might not know when exams/projects are due compared to more open weekends... And flights from Valencia vary in price a lot from what I see on Skyscanner now, so I'm not sure how to plan ahead or not or how much)
- clothes to pack (everyone is telling me I'll over pack but it's very intimidating on how to pack for a long trip like this where August is going to be intensely hot &amp; busy, but November could be quite chilly. Also the shoes are a stresser for me because of all of the walking but I also want to be comfortable &amp; stylish because it's Europe)

I would take any advice from travel experts like yourselves to help ease some of the uncertainty I feel about finally getting to go abroad but having never done something like this.",Studying abroad in Spain this fall - looking for tips,,ms640,,16,2022-07-06 18:25:16

However, when I checked my Hiltons App the price was $573.00

I called Hilton who said their side is right - despite me telling them they provide their rates to the agency. Soooo what’s going on? They said they’ll forward me to Booking.com and hung up lol. I called Booking who was confused as to why they would say that and called the hotel directly - Came back and said Hilton claims it’s a tax difference. 

According to charge summary with Hilton the room rate is $504.00 + 12.50% tax + $2/night fee. 

To me it’s obviously not the tax, right? $504 and $408….. unless they hid taxes in the room rate. 

I know it’s best to book through the hotel directly but I didn’t this time. I never had this problem the other times I did it. I really don’t want to be a Karen over this but my budget is tight for this important trip to family.

So I live in Manitoba, and seeing how travel is finally opening up again I was hoping to take a week or so off to explore Canada a bit. Originally I had a road trip planned with enough people that everything was going to be affordable, like gas, the airbnb, etc. But now in an unfortunate domino effect people started opting out, and now I may have to travel solo or with one other person.

My issue though is now that we're in the middle of summer, all the flight prices have gone through the roof, gas is too expensive to go cross country, and Via Rail seems to be a luxury. I only make minimum wage so my budget from saving up is only around $1500. That's supposed to cover travel, accommodation for a week, and small excursions. It was plenty enough when traveling in a big group, but now it seems I can't get anything with that sorta money.

These type of sites are hands down the cheapest means of travel I've found in terms of multi-country packages. When I try to replicate an identical package through my own means, it's easily double.

TravelHacks,"**Time to go public! Here are the top perks of public transport and why you should be trying to use it more in the UK.**

Fuel costs have gone through the roof recently (£2 a litre, are you kidding me?)

As someone always looking to save and live as frugally as possible, I’ve started to use public transport much more.  
I know it isn’t viable for everyone because infrastructure is rubbish in some places. I visited a friend down by the coast, and the trains to London were once an hour.

But for those of us near or in cities, you can get about pretty effortlessly on the buses and trains.  
So here are the top 5 perks of using public transport. Drumroll, please…

1. It’s less stressful (mostly) - As long as you plan and leave in plenty of time, it’s nice to have someone else do all the hard work for you. Reading a book or watching a movie on your commute is far more relaxing than turning up to work covered in sweat, having sworn at every driver that hasn’t quite figured out where their indicator is yet.
2. You don’t have to worry about, or pay for, parking - I hate paying for parking on principle, especially when the rates vary so much from place to place. Public transport helps you avoid that headache so you can just arrive and go and do the things you want to do.
3. It makes the city a nicer place to be - I’m not the sentimental sort. I’ve lived in built-up areas most of my life, but fewer cars mean less noise and less toxic Victorian-like smogs drifting all over the place. That can’t be a bad thing.
4. It reduces your carbon footprint - Now, I care about the planet as much as the next guy. Public transport helps me save some cash, and it benefits the planet. I think that would be your classic win-win.
5. It’s cheaper than running a car - I know some people will argue this point but on average public transport is more affordable. That means more money in your skyrocket to do what you WANT to do instead of what you HAVE to do.

I spend a lot of my time commuting into London for gigs and events, so I’ve kind of got this down to a fine art now. Here’s how you can tie all that together to make the most of it in London.

Don’t pay for a single trip on the bus - ever. Use your contactless and get the whole day for £4.95.  
Use the Hopper fare for free unlimited bus travel within an hour after using your payment card for the first time.  
If you’re looking to stay the night in London like I do after a gig, start with booking . com and see what deals you can sniff out. There’s also this really cool browser extension called Slash that gives you an instant discount when you use it to book so you can save a bit more.

If you’re planning to do something interesting with your time or eat out at a decent restaurant, you can use that same Slash App for extra money off at Groupon and Red Letter Days for free.

Combine public transport with great deals, and you can still treat yourself and the family to some amazing days out. That App has been a bit of a revelation for me, and I use it as often as possible to save as much as possible.  
Hopefully, this will switch you onto public transport and help you save some cash in the process.

Cheers.",[UK] Top perks of public transport and why you should be trying to use it more. [OC],,woefullodging,,1,2022-06-28 12:31:25
TravelHacks,"My family and I recently bought Steelers season tickets and will be traveling from Cincinnati to Pittsburgh about 8-10 times every year. Typically 2-night weekend stays.

Just wondering if anyone has any better suggestions? I thought maybe if we could find an AirBNB renter that we had a good experience with maybe we could work something out at a discounted rate if we book so many times per year.

Long story short. I booked a birthday getaway in August for my wife and I to stay at the Seadust Resort in Cancun as it was priced within our budget. I booked this as a package deal via Expedia with flights as well.

TravelHacks,"Hey folks

So last week I went on a work trip to the USA (California) from the UK. Long story short, British Airways messed up my flights at both ends and delayed me by 17 hours going out and 5 hours coming back. 

From reading [https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/) it seems in most circumstances I could be due £520 of compensation per flight. Some of my work plans where ballsed up, but my works given me free reign to claim this money for myself due to the stress incurred, I've put in a claim through BAs online portal, but just wondering if theres ways I can cut them off from potentially trying to wiggle out of any claims. 

For details on what happened. On my outbound flight from another UK airport to LHR, we landed on time, but did not have a gate available so sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half waiting on buses to take to the terminal, meaning I missed my connecting flight from LHR to the US. They put me up in a hotel &amp; promised meals, but the hotel didn't provide dinner as BA never instructed them too. 

On the way back I really have no idea what the cause for the delay was, my flight in the US boarded 30mins late, left the runway almost an hour late, then orbited LHR for ages coming in meaning we got to the gate, again, about an hour &amp; a half late, meaning I missed my connecting flight back home. 

It felt like BAs failings on both ends, are they able to wiggle out of me claiming a full £1040 in compensation?","UK &lt;&gt; USA Flight delays, how do I find out why my plane was delayed for compensation?",,CAElite,,3,2022-06-24 14:53:39

As soon as I swiped my credit card, my credit card app updated and let me know I had used so much of my credit limit and let me know I had X amount left to use. It stayed that way all weekend. 

I returned the car Monday afternoon and when I woke up Tuesday morning my credit card app had gone back to having my full credit limit available and had no record anywhere about the car rental purchase or having the $400 due. In fact it was the first time I had ever used that card and it now says “no transaction history”.

TravelHacks,"Hey all! 

Was pondering the question myself and decided to put it out to y'all. Given a relatively sizable amount of MR (Amex) points, ~600,000 points, what would you prioritize your redemption on? 

First class long-haul tickets for 2???
OR.. 
Luxury 5 star accommodations???

What I have found was that I have always personally been obsessed with redeeming points for the absolute highest value. But I just began to wonder if the highest redemption rate is truly the best way to use points. Namely, the outsized value in redeeming first class flights. i.e. last year, my wife and I were fortunate enough to fly the new Singapore airlines first class suites (jfk-fra-sin) for 264,000 points RT each (528,000 points total). To put it into perspective, the flight would cost about ~$20,000 each pushing the redemption to  about 7.5 cents per point. That makes the redemption fantastic by all means. Also, the flight was an absolute dream. 

On the other hand, we are about to go to the Maldives and choose to fly economy (from NYC) because we did not have enough points to both fly business and stay at the hotel we wanted. We will be staying at the St Regis Maldives resort (overwater villa) for 10 nights and the cost was 620,000 Marriott points. The redemption rate was about 4 cents a point after fees. We have been to this resort before as well.

Let's just get to the point, we chose 10 days at the St Regis Maldives over another chance at the first class suites on Singapore airlines. Even at the cost of sitting in economy for 20+ hours (including layovers).

One thing I noticed immediately was that, hotels are already for two people, but flights you obviously have to pay per ticket. Given that first class flight will always have the best redemption rates, is it truly worth the amount of points to burn. 

So again, what's your take? Given you have two options..
Burn you points on a first class flight experience and stay at 'standard' accommodations? Or go all out on your accommodations and stick to an economy flight? Also keep in mind that the flight redemption will more than likely have the 'highest redemption value' of the two options.",First class or Five stars?

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone!

I run several hotels around Europe, and as I get this question from friends a lot, I thought I share my insights for all of you to apply:

1. Do your research (obviously): Look at all meta-search engines &amp; OTAs. In my experience, currently, you find the best prices on the [booking.com](https://booking.com) mobile app, especially if you have a certain ""Genius"" status (which you get pretty fast)
2. Go direct: everyone knows hotels pay commissions, so help them save on the commission and save yourself some money by emailing them directly.
3. Look at smaller (boutique) hotels: the bigger brands have a centralized revenue management office, so most of the time, the person you are talking to doesn't have the power to give you a good deal. If you speak to smaller hotels, the person you are talking to probably sets the prices.
4. Be charming: It should be obvious, but people do it wrong every.single.time: be super friendly; this increases your chances of getting a better price significantly. Who would you rather give a deal? The smart-ass or the nice &amp; clever fella who just asks for an (understandable) better rate
5. Look at higher room categories: Don't choose the cheapest of the smallest. If you go for a higher room category, the hotel has much more flexibility to give you a better rate as they (mostly) have more availability in these categories, and it doesn't hurt their overall performance (revenue per available room) if they give you a deal. We are looking for the most VALUE for money, not the cheapy cheapest stuff.   


I hope this has helped some of you. Let me know if you have additional tips, as I also don't know it all:)   


See you around!

TravelHacks,"Is there a way to find a cheap flight to literally any city, that has a specific stopover? The idea is to not take the second part of the flight and take advantage of the cheap cost. 
Example: flight from Vancouver to Barcelona, stopover in London. Cost to fly straight to London is $2000, cost to take the option to Barcelona is $1000. Stay in London, abandon the flight from London to Barcelona.

I’ve heard of people doing this but have no clue how to find the deal city + specific stopover.

We’ll be flying in and out of Edinburgh and renting a car to do a driving tour of the country. Cost isn’t the main concern, although we’d like to be relatively sensible when possible (we hope to stay in guesthouses with breakfast and self-cater lunches when possible).

Having a great experience is the main priority. With that in mind, I’m crowd sourcing some recommendations and have a few questions:

1.  There’s so much to see- what is absolutely unmissable, and what can be “skipped” or set aside only if we have extra time?

2.  What really made your trip amazing/ terrible? (excellent tour guide, packing the right clothes, spending a day on an excursion that wasn’t worth it, etc)

TravelHacks," 

Hi all!

I have been looking for a Carry-on trolley (4 wheels 360) which includes a laptop compartment 15"". Normally I travel with my osprey 40L fairpoint but since I now often do some business trips I'd like a 40L carry-on trolley. Also for the fact that I will be traveling to New york for 11 days (not a business trip, just exploring the city!) and I think now it is nice to have something you do not have to carry on your back. I think it would be better for me to use the backpack if I go to ""non-city"" places.

Basically I will bring some clothes (for approx 11 days) and a laptop (with charger and some cables) with me.

Any tips? My budget is around 200 dollars (a little bit more is ok)

Thank you!",Carry-on trolley with laptop compartment,,BukHunt,,4,2022-06-14 07:13:17

I've already tried speaking to TAP's customer service with less than ideal options. Basically I'm unable to get any sort of refund from TAP directly, even though the reason for my cancellation is due to my mother being in the ICU for the past 2 weeks and I don't see her leaving the hospital anytime soon. 

I also tried changing the flight altogether (instead of cancelling/trying for a refund), meaning inquired about bumping up the flight date and origination (essentially curbing my entire itinerary and doing quick weekend thing, which I'm iffy about given the circumstances and it would still cost me quite a bit to change the flight and the flight times aren't great).

My questions are: 1) can someone help guide me continue to get a full flight refund, and 2) should I still purchase travel insurance and then go through the travel insurance to get the refund?

TravelHacks,"For the first time in many years, my family of 4 (teenage kids) is taking a 1500 mile road trip in July and we're looking to rent a big, comfortable SUV for the trip. We only have compact commuter cars at home and are looking to splurge on the rental to make the driving part as fun and as comfortable as possible. While I understand this subreddit is about frugality, I'm hoping to get advice on both cheap and maybe not-so-cheap options.

* We have plenty of rental companies around us in the Bay Area (Hertz, National, etc)
* I know, big dumb SUV, bad for the environment, etc. We have compact electric cars at home and bike everywhere so my conscious is clear being 'Murican, with a big dumb but comfortable car for a week.
* We are well aware of gas prices and know it's going to be expensive filling it up. It is what it is and we've budgeted for it. 
* We're not going to be sleeping in the car or camping with it. Just driving it to our various destinations.
* We're not bringing ski gear, kayaks, etc, just regular old luggage.
* We'd like to have suggestions for rental vehicles that companies actually rent. My buddy loves his brand new 2022 Bronco but that's not something I can find for rental anywhere.

Anyway, looking for suggestions or personal experiences on what SUVs could fit the bill. Searching online for this kind of advice basically leads me to the car buying experience, which isn't what I'm doing here.

I will be taking a trip to Europe later this summer, I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve so I have significant insurance benefits related to trip cancellation, medical emergencies, etc. However, I have read from other Redditors that Chase's trip interruption insurance won't really cover COVID related quarantine expenses, such as the hotel cost or any other costs - even when the trip needs to be extended.

I'm also reading that some coverages come with a COVID quarantine benefit, such as paying $250/day for COVID quarantine expenses, EVEN when they are the original days planned in your trip. I'm starting to research some of these options, but one element I'm struggling with is plans that include duplication of all of the benefits I have with the CSR card (trip cancellation, medical, accident, etc.). 

Does anybody know of a carrier that offers *just* the trip interruption insurance that would cover COVID quarantine, without the other elements?

After you pay for the membership, find a place you want to go! Anywhere…just have a passport for out of country sits obviously. There are quite a few in America, In most states. More sits are added pretty much daily so just keep looking. 

You find a place/owners/pets that you feel comfortable with and then you will apply to the sit. Tell them why you are the best for sitting their pets or home. They may pick you and they may not. Apply to more. 

For example, me and my fiancé have a combined account and we sometimes take my daughter. Probably 3 out of 15 applications usually get interest but I know single people get more interests in their applications. After applying to probably 15 sits in Florida we finally got accepted for a FaceTime “interview”/meet and greet. We will be staying in a nice gated community taking care of super easy pets for a week. 

Just pay for traveling expenses and food but in our experiences people will let you have access to food/community amenities/and alcohol lol. 

Think about it. A membership is $90 or so (depending what plan you pick) for a year. Unlimited travel! Air bnbs are generally no less than $50-$100 a night. For me this is an awesome deal.

As a Canadian travelling in Europe, I mostly use plug adapter or converter. However, I don’t know if it’s my adapters or converters who are too old or broken, but I noticed that my plugs are becoming very warm and hot if I’m charging my devices (phone and camera). Also, my phone touch screen is always acting weird when charging (click wrong place, ghost clicking or Touch ID not working).

So I came to ask myself, would it better to buy local plug in Europe instead of using adapter?

Most electronic devices these days are working from 100-240V, so why use an adapter?

TravelHacks,"OK,  yall. Help me solve a mystery. 

We stayed at an all-inclusive in Cancun. Throughout our trip, I could NOT get served by waiters unless my husband was present. If he was with us, waiters would come up to us, offer both of us drinks and then quickly produce them and keep coming back with more. Each time we were brought anything we tipped between $3 and $5 USD. 

If my husband was somewhere else, however, I could not get anyone to serve me. I could not get a bartender to respond at a bar, and I couldn't flag down a waiter without literally running in front of them and standing in their path, which I only resorted to at the end of our trip, since it seems pretty rude and I really don't like to be disrespectful to people in the service industry. I've been there, shitty customers are the worst. I tried to be very polite and thank everyone every time. Regardless of how I got their attention, I still tipped between $3 and $5 every time. Like I said, I've been there, and I realize they're all overworked and underpaid. This discrepancy persisted throughout our whole trip, and regardless of location or waiter. My husband witnessed it several times while standing apart from us, but within viewing range, so I don't think this is just me being over sensitive or anything.

I don't know of physical appearance played a part or not. For reference, we are both English-speaking Americans with a little Spanish, probably with terrible accents. We're both working to improve our Spanish. We're both a bit overweight with naturally blonde hair, though mine is currently dyed pink. 90% of the time, I had my 5yo son with me, who's super sweet and definitely wasn't rude to anyone, though they may not have known that he'd be well behaved before interaction. While at the pool, I was always wearing a normal tankini style bathing suit, with my husband in trunks, and my son in trunks and a rash guard. Sometimes I had a rash guard as well. If on a beach chair at the pool, I'd add a swim cover-up with covered shoulders (we all have Nordic skin and sun-burn in about 5 minutes). While out of the pool, I was generally in a maxi-dress while my husband and son would typically be in a Hawaiian shirt and shorts. All of us would have been wearing nice sandals. This fit in well with what others were wearing, so I think we were always dressed appropriately. 100% of the time, I was wearing sunglasses. Most people weren't, as it was overcast for the entirety of our trip, but I have Parkinson's induced light sensitivity, so I'm always wearing sunnies. Other than the light sensitivity, my symptoms aren't visible and I wasn't shaking, so I don't think that could be a factor.

Any idea why I couldn't get service? Any tips for being able to get service on future trips?

I'm really big on inclusive budgeting so when I mean $1500, I mean $1500 for everything (well, not including flight and rental). When I look at the prices in Hawaii, $1500 for a vacation becomes smaller and smaller. We don't mind budget hotels as all we need is a place to sleep as long as it's safe. But also, we don't want to miss out on a great experience, because its obviously not very easy to ""do it next time""

- Room (Airbnb hopping seems out of the question due to the fees stacking on top of each other)
- Breakfast, snack and dinner (1-2 ""authentically Hawaiin??"" places actually worth splurging on and cheap great local options to offset them)
- Excursions tours and tips (will a wrangler get me to Mauna kea?) (Is a helicopter tour worth it?)
- GAS 😭(I love driving and know there's some great trails, but I have to account for some serious gas on a Wrangler, what road trip destinations are an absolute must. On that note, I did choose to rent a wrangler on purpose, so we really want some absolute must-visit areas.)
- Everything in me says Luaus are tourist traps, but I feel like I can't not do one. Which one should we go for?

TravelHacks,"Tried posting in r/Travel but auto-rejects this question

Was told Pre-Paid Rental Car unavailable 1 day before 2-week road trip. Advice?

Booked and Pre-Purchased a non-refundable rental (cargo van) from Hertz directly in mid April for use of period of 2.5 weeks starting today. The afternoon 1 day before we are to pick up the vehicle get a call from local branch saying they won't have the vehicle and that it was a mistake that it was allowed to be booked (I've rented cargo vans from them in the past).

All they would/could do is say sorry for the inconvenience, and try to pass me on the the corporate 1-800#.. I called that and after several hours still without any solution. They did mention I could get a large SUV from their ""sister"" company (Dollar) for an upgrade fee of $4800!

As of right now now it is 18 hours from when we were to pick up the vehicle and no solution yet.. Any advice? I tried checking other rental companies and their prices are sky-high and no one else does cargo van. A larger SUV could work but not at that cost. Frustrating that they did this such short notice and unwilling to rectify their mistake.

I don't understand the point of pre-paying for a rental months in advance just for them to say not available.


========================================


UPDATE: I didn't give up, took about 4 hours total of talking to  phone agents, supervisors, branch supervisor, and finally district manager but they gave me what I wanted.. a comparable vehicle for the price I paid for the orginal reservation.  The phone support from the 800 # are worthless and LIE. 

What I did was get a phone supervisor on the line, he repeatedly said policy is that for a vehicle change no matter the situation the difference must be paid. He said I could call the local branch and answer would be the same.. so what I did was just that, with him still on the line I merged calls to local branch and ask about that policy and let them two talk to each other. The branch employee disagreed with the phone supervisor to the point they merged in a district manager. This was key. 

The district manager was actually helpful when the situation was explained. She was also irate with the phone supervisor to the point she demanded his employee ID # right there with all of us on the line. Anyways, I explained I simply wanted the comparable vehicle and manager said they would offer the 7 passenger for the same price and duration, instead of the $4k ""upcharge"" the phone supervisor said was mandatory. 

In essence knowing this now do whatever you can to get a US based branch district manager. The phone support no matter the level sucks. Phone supervisor says he is top level and no one above him to escalate to.",Was told Pre-Paid Rental Car unavailable 1 day before 2-week road trip. Advice?,,dingle__berries,,21,2022-06-02 04:33:12

TravelHacks,"Don't get me wrong, there are some places where you absolutely need a tour guide in order to fully understand what you are seeing and how to get around safely in a particular country / area.

But if the area you want to visit and learn more about is easily accessible to anyone. I highly recommend you avoid tour guides and enjoy the experience for yourself.

The problem with tour guides is they rush you and pressure you to keep moving around, not leaving you to take in and enjoy the moment for what it's worth . Whenever you arrive to a nice place, a few minutes later the guide will be near the car ordering you to get in. This is not a way to properly appreciate what you are there to see, if you are alone, you will feel way more free and relaxed instead of stressed and rushed. 

If you want to use tour guides to learn more about the history of an area, there are plenty of audiobooks, podcasts on the Internet to help you learn more about it by yourself.

TravelHacks,"Hi Reddit,

I am from India. I am a student and from a poor family.  I am very much into video games, specially Dota 2. This year the biggest esports event is going to be held for the first time in Singapore. I feel like this is my one and only opportunity to watch this event live by traveling to Singapore. I always had this dream to watch The International(Dota 2 event) in person. It's a now or never for me despite I have literally 0 savings with 5 months in hand. Yet, me and my partner have decided that no matter what we will attend this event. We will work our ass off for the next 5 months. I feel like we can manage around a $950. The event ticket price itself for two is going to be around I assume $200. 

So with $750 in hand is  there any chance we can still make a 3 days trip to a rich country like Singapore? 

Also, this is my first trip outside my country. So I have literally 0 idea about currency exchange. It might sound stupid but I am still going to ask that if I convert my money into Singaporean Dollars, can I carry them as cash with me while entering Singapore? 

One more thing is that how much money do I need to show in my bank account in order to get Singapore Visa? 
 
I know I am asking a lot of questions(stupid questions) but trust me I am clueless af. Please help me out. We really want to do this trip.

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,
Just wanted to sure an app that I’m sure some of you have already heard of and may already be using that will give you rebates for checking making purchases at gas stations and restaurants. This app is partnered with certain gas stations and restaurants so all you need to do to receive a rebate is check in and enter the kind of card you will be using or just do what I do and upload your receipt after you have made a purchase. The app gives you a certain value per gallon bought at gas stations as well as will give you a percentage back at certain restaurants. This app has worked great for me as I travel a lot for work and so far I have made about $50. This app is 100% legit and although it won’t make you rich it does take a bit of the pain away from filling up/eating out. Just thought I’d share 

Here’s a link to the app:

- Staying in LV and do some sightseeing and hit up some local spots for 2 days.

- Go back to LV stay a day
- Take a bus the next day to Anaheim maybe stay there for a 2-3 days and hit up Disneyland and maybe visit other spots in Cali. and beaches. 
- Fly out of one of the airports in CA, (not sure which yet or if I should fly in CA first then do LV and GC last)

I want to figure out an elegant solution with the following parameters

* I can use my unlocked iPhone 13.
   * note: this has a dual sim option... could this help with this hack?
* I can keep and use my US phone number (the one all of my US-based connections use), and it works for (at least) receiving texts from US-based connections while traveling (and, ideally, also seeing who is try to make calls to me/receiving voicemails), plus talk/text and decent-good data coverage/speeds while I'm home in the US.
* I want just-good-enough data speed internationally to use Google maps, send emails, open a websites... I don't need anything high bandwidth.
* I want to be able to use wifi calling to make calls using my US-based phone number to US-based connections.
* I'd like the mechanics to be painless as possible: I don't have to swap around simcards or contact service providers every time I come and go from another country.
* The solution is a reasonable cost (no more than, say $60-70/month... preferably less).

Here are some things I've explored and why they won't work for me:

* T-Mobile plan: They aren't OK with me being away for 4 months, and 128 kbps intl data speed is perhaps not even enough for my limited requirements.
* Google Fi: They aren't OK with me being away for 4 months, and they don't have wifi calling on iphones.

Here are some ingredients I've looked into that might combine to make this work:

* International Data Sims
* TextNow app
* Text/call forwarding services

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone!

Writing to you from Nafplio, Greece, 3 weeks into what is going to be a 4 month backpacking trip through the Balkans and some of Central/Eastern Europe.

I wanted to share some of my general thoughts with you guys, where I got burned on money so far, what ended up cheaper than I expected, and other various things.

To start off,

Utilize Google maps. I feel this is an obvious one to many, but the amount of people I have come across who don't know how to use the website/app to its full potential is shocking.

Searching for places to sleep is, in my humble opinion the easiest to do while zooming in on the location of interest in Google maps, and clicking the ""hotels"" button, which then shows you every hotel in the vicinity and the price. You can even put in the dates you want to find availabilities. I'd avoid websites like booking.com and trivago or whatever else exists. I always find the phone number of a place of interest, and directly call them to confirm prices and availabilities. 

Secondly, utilize supermarkets. This is a big one for me. If you are looking to longterm travel (anything over a month), and want to save some money, make your own sandwiches! Don't sit down at a tavern, restaurant, or whatever every meal, instead go to a supermarket. They often have cooked meals/sandwiches/burgers inside which are usually much much cheaper than sitting down at an establishment. I'm not saying don't sit down at all, but don't do it for every meal! The fun of it wears off if it's all you do...

While we are on this topic, location matters! That supermarket is going to have higher prices if it's in the middle of downtown! The same goes for cornershops, rooms, basically anything. When I am booking a room to stay in, the first thing I look for is proximity to a bus station, and that it's not in the middle of tourist central. I'd also really recommend taking that extra 5-10min walk out of downtown to shop for food, or even sit down to eat. The prices change astronomically! Also, you're better off (in terms of enjoyment, and finances-usually) to book a room in 1 location which is in an area that is close to public transport for a couple days, rather than hop from location to location sleeping in a different place every night. It usually ends up being cheaper, and you don't have to pack up everything and move all the time. It feels more like a vacation this way.

To not keep this too long, I'll add one more tip.

Find someone to travel with. Whether it's someone you meet on the road, or a friend from your hometown, anyone you can get along with. Keep it to a pair in my opinion as rarely will you fully enjoy yourself in a big group of let's say 6 (everyone usually wants to do something different).  I've saved about a thousand dollars so far just by travelling with my girlfriend instead of alone. Oftentimes a room in a motel is cheaper than 2 beds in a hostel. That sandwich looks really big that you just ordered? You can split it. 2 budgets, one mind goes a long way. Not to mention that you're safer this way, and should you want to hitchhike (don't be afraid to do this with 2 people!), people are more likely to pick you up when there's 2 of you rather than alone.

I could write all day, but this is already a book.

If you like me, and want to see what I'm all about and how I'm making 4 months of travel possible on a really low budget, check out my humble channel, I've just started creating travel videos, and I'm fairly consistent:)

All love,

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,

Last year, my girlfriend and I booked a trip outside of Canada around Christmas. Unfortunately, due to the rising COVID cases around that time, my girlfriend did not feel comfortable going. We were able to cancel her ticket and Air Canada issued a credit for the amount (700ish).

We are now planning a trip this summer and want to use the travel credit. I spoke with a representative from Air Canada recently and they informed me the credit is only valid for my girlfriend. This means only she can use it and we would have to book separately. I don't mind paying for my ticket in full but obviously we would like to book together to take advantage of it. 
 
I am able to get a travel voucher; however, it will take about 10 weeks to arrive. Had I known about this when we cancelled, I would've requested the travel voucher at the time. With the voucher, we would be able to both utilize the credit, instead of booking separately. 

My question is would there be any way for us to book together and use the travel credit? Maybe some sort of trick or tips for this?

I have never travelled internationally before. I've lived in South Africa my whole life and now I want to move to the UK in January. I have a couple of questions and concerns.

I've heard I should book a return flight instead of one way, but why? Fir insurance? Is this true? If the travel insurance from using my credit card covers illness  accidents, lost luggage, etc - is it financially worth it? 

I was also told to do this on my credit card but when I briefly looked at the terms and conditions it said I needed to prove that I'm not emigrating. How would I do that?

I appreciate any assistance in advance.

I have a round trip ticket (American) booked through chase and now only need the “to” flight.

Called the chase travel agency to get it changed. Turns out, they need to cancel the entire trip and rebook. I’d only save $32 changing to one-way.

Does it make sense to even do this? Is there any way I can get compensated from American on the return day by not showing up and letting someone on standby take my seat?

Context:

-Traveling to Austin for a wedding with my wife
-Have a conference in Dallas so flying there after wedding
-Can my wife give up my seat since I won’t be showing up for additional compensation or travel credit?

TravelHacks,"I am trying to help a friend to find a way to turn off her text message notifications while sending an ""out-of-office"" auto-reply without using roaming while she's in vacation abroad.


My friend is an independent professional hairdresser and she uses text messages with her clients for setting up appointments.

She's leaving for 3 weeks abroad for vacation and is wondering how she could find a way to send an auto-reply text message to any clients trying to reach her to let them know she's away.

I've try to find some solutions on the web but I see several issues there.

First of all : she won't be able to send regular text message abroad without roaming so that's not an option. She won't be receiving the text messages if she turns off roaming, which is good to avoid notification but not good to set up some kind of auto-reply system.

Is there a web service she could use or forward her text message to in order to reply using her phone number through internet?

Can we setup that kind of auto reply directly with the carrier within the country of origin (which would mean not roaming) ?

Is there an app to do anything that could help her with her issue ?

- It cannot use roaming
- she doesn't know which client will reach her but needs to be able to send an auto-reply using her number

TravelHacks,"I prepaid for a reservation for a Car rental from Thrifty at ATL. The price was $214 for the weekend. I show up and they say they have to cars available, even though I (and about 10 other customers) had prepaid reservations. They told us to check back in the morning to see if cars were available then. I was in town for a wedding and had to drive through the night, so I was unable to wait until the morning, so I had to look to other options.

It was late at night, so the only other Car rental company that was open and had cars was Budget. The cheapest car they had available was $590, so I had to rent from them.

I called Thrifty the day after and requested they refund my down-payment and also compensate me for the nearly $400 financial loss that I incurred due to the price of the cheapest available car at the airport available for a last-minute booking.

I understand that mistakes happen and companies are entitled to make mistakes, but companies should also rectify the situation with their customers when a mistake is made. In this case, Thrifty made a mistake by not correctly allocating the number of cars to fulfill my reservation, and it directly caused me to suffer a $400 financial loss,

The are currently giving me the runaround and it does not seem like they'll be compensating me for the $400. How would I go about getting compensated for this mistake that Thrifty made?",How to get compensation from Rental Car company for their mistake?,,Kottyforeman22,,4,2022-05-23 20:45:03

TravelHacks,"My younger brother is going to be studying abroad in Prague this Fall, and I plan to go visit him for a week in late November/early December for his birthday before he returns to the US.

I went to Prague a couple years ago in 2017 and absolutely hated it. Very overrated, crowded, touristy...three days there was long enough. I ignorantly expected it to be like Budapest (which I absolutely ***loved***) and left extremely disappointed. I hear the city has gotten even more touristy since then.

I'm visiting Prague for him (and not the city) and I plan to only spend two days or so there before we set off on going to one or two different spots. I've been to basically every Western European + Nordic capital (except for Brussels and Paris as I have no desire to go to either). I loved Vienna and Budapest so I thought about going to one of those again...I went in the Summer to each, and I figure the vibe will be different in the Winter. Honestly though, I would prefer to go somewhere new.

I really don't like crowded, touristy places...for that reason I had a terrible time in Amsterdam, for example (yet strangely loved Rome) and conversely loved Copenhagen because it was chill, uncrowded, minimal and not touristy...Copenhagen was actually what I had imagined Amsterdam would be like.

I don't really want to do Coastal Southeastern Europe, Greece, or the Baltics in the Winter, so I was thinking either Poland (specifically Krakow), Istanbul, Bucharest, or Belgrade. I've also heard great things about Sarajevo.

Our family is Polish and from Krakow, so we always thought it would be fun to visit. I've been dying to go to Istanbul, too, and I have heard amazing things about Bucharest and Belgrade in general.

We don't really have a set budget in mind (I am going to be paying for his transport as his birthday present) and I am okay flying between cities.

Can't reach anyone, emailed, nothing. That is a nightmare, but not something I \*need\* to happen immediately. I'm honestly considering just giving up on this, it's not worth the effort and stress, I'd be okay with just taking out tourist visas indefinitely (although there is no way I can find to cancel this application!). I even went to the building it's in with my documents and was told I couldn't go up without booking an appointment, but there is no way I can find to book an appointment!! This is VFS Chicago, if that matters.

My concern is that in a couple of months, I'll need to apply also through VFS for a French visa in order to go on a fellowship, which will be time-sensitive. I can't apply yet as I don't have my work contract, but I'll start the process as soon as I do. My question is as to whether anyone has insight into how VFS works: will the fact that I have this issue with a stalled Indian OCI application throw a wrench into/affect at all my application for a French visa through the same service?

TravelHacks,"So, I'm planning to do a three to four month trip around the world next year. I don't want to bring only carry-on, as I will be doing a lot of hiking, and thus I'll have tentstakes with me. However, I still want to bring only a small bag, as I enjoy minimal and UL travel. My backpack is a UL backpack, and thus I want to protect it while checked in. The whole garbage bag route seems a big hassle, and I have a massive (50L) drybag, in which my pack fits. Additionally, the rolltop handle could be used to attach a luggage tag.

TravelHacks,"I'm a 21yo guy, i have the dream of going to LA and i finally have the money to make this come true.
There are some problems that i need to fix in order to go and i thought that someone can help me or share some tips :)

I'm gonna make bullet point in order to make this easier to read and answer to.



1. FEAR OF FLYING

Yep, it's the ol' classic fear of flying. The ironic part is that i've been to Japan (14hrs flight) without having any fear.
3 years ago i had a very bad flight (hard turbulences) and i now have extreme fear if i even imagine being on a plane. This is the hardest part of course, how can i go to the States without a plane? I have to do something about it. 



2. I'M ALONE

Altough i'm an introvert and i'm pretty comfortable being alone, i'm going to the other part of the globe alone. LA is dangerous and i'm only a 21yo guy, i'm afraid to go alone cause you never know. Unfortunatelly my friends don't have the economic resources to come with me and my family could come, but i'd prefer if they don't cause yk...it's LA, i can't go in the city of fun with my mom.



3. IS LA REALLY AMAZING?

I read various reviews of LA on trip advisor. Many people had a bad time: they thought LA was fantastic but then realized it was not what they thought and was actually terrible. I love what i see on a screen, but is it really the truth or is it a tourist rappresentation of the city?","From Rome to LA alone, need advice",,RealOkamy,,7,2022-05-16 09:40:42

I’ve traveled in the past to Mexico but I always went to Mexico City (capital of Mexico) and then I took a bus to her hometown. I am trying to do a flight in one go right now because last time I had so many complications that a 24 hour flight turned into a 60 hour travel with multiple connections and no sleep. I am kinda trying to surprise her but because I am a student and currently an exchange student for 1 more month I do not have a job and rely on the money, my school grants me, to be an exchange student. All the flights I have seen are 800+ euros that’s too expensive for me. 

We are planning on living together in the Netherlands next year but before we do that I wanna live with her in Mexico to see how it is. In my opinion making such a big step is not smart without having a trail run.

We're NOT looking for the typical tourist attractions like visiting old cathedrals or stuff like that. Those we can find with a simple google search. We're looking for those things not mentioned in every tourist guide.

I hope some of you can. Thanks in advance!

TravelHacks,"Will add some details. The hotel is in NYC (soho). I have stayed here on another occasion. Reserves through third party (sorry).

Price point it’s not on the expensive/luxurious side but not a “cheap hostel”. Price point is 350-400 for the double bed room I’m staying at. 

(During this second stay I already had to request a change because the room they gave me was awful compared to the one I stayed at my last stay on the same. Way  smaller with no place to put my clothes and the bathroom was worse in every single way. Politely asked for a better room and by chance they gave me the one I stayed at last time.)

This time around on my 4th night out of 8 this happened.  (Videos are not in order)

[https://imgur.com/a/ZEoBP27](https://imgur.com/a/ZEoBP27)

Terrible noise at 3 am(the video with the lights on). It woke me up, had to go to the front desk to address the issue. 

They told me the heater was acting up, I should close the water / heating valves. I complied. The noise changed into the second version of the noise (the one in the dark clips).

Went to the front desk again, they told me the issue would fix itself and it did not, it sporadically starts this weird noise.

My sleep is already fucked and I’m very non functional in low sleep.

Am I being entitled for asking for compensation? What should I expect when I go to discuss the issue at the front desk again. I currently have no energy and in a terrible mood to engage in a conversation with the poor guy that is at the desk at 4:50 am.  (This issue started ar 3 am).

So if any experienced traveler could give me some tips I would gladly appreciate.",[request] tips dealing with a bad experience in a hotel. (Terrible night).,,ZellahYT,,2,2022-05-09 08:51:20

I'm looking at 1100-1200pp into Liberia and 650ish pp into SJ.  It seems crazy!

I have a flight voucher from Iberia for canceled flights from March 2020. The current voucher I have says it is good to be used on flights with following airlines: LEVEL, Iberia, Vueling, British airways, and connections with other carriers.

My question is that when I’m searching flights on Iberia’s website, the cheapest flights are operated by American Airlines, yet sold by Iberia. When I’ve put my voucher code in, it says I can’t use it. When I’ve called customer service in the past, they’re dismissive other than extending the date of the voucher.

I’m wondering if anyone has had luck getting Iberia to change the terms on the voucher to include American Airlines or others?

In the past I used TransferWise once to transfer money to someone abroad. However, I never thought of using it more than that.

Now I will travel back again and I'm trying to find ways to save money (cashback, no fees, promo code which never seems to work, etc.).

I'm thinking that travelling with a Wise card would be a great way to save money, but I'm not sure to understand how it works.

1. Do you need to add your own money into the Wise account (transfer from local Bank to Wise account)? If yes, is there any fees doing that?
2. What's the best way to travel? Transfer money in Wise account, pay stuffs with lower fees than your country credit card and after your trip transfer back all the money left in your bank account?
3. They seems to have a Virtual Card now. What's about?

Normally, I pay abroad with credit cash (fees) or withdraw cash (other fees). If I pay with Wise, do I still get fees (lower) or no fees at all since maybe it show as a local credit/debit card?

I would also prefer to have access to it regularly during the day and even leave it there for more than 24 hours at a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll stay for 10 days and take the train to and from Charing Cross every morning. I'll be meeting with some business associates for a graffiti and music art project we're working on. I plan on day-tripping around the city in the evenings, as I've only been there once before, so I get to see more parts of it and go to some of the pubs later on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the working hours for the storage facility at most train stations in London are from 7 AM-11 PM, and I'll need to leave my bags for 1-2 days at a time. Plus, I'd like the lowest possible price for a prolonged """"stay,"""" as well as the ability to check in on the bag and take or leave things there during the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides the luggage storage in the train stations, I've found this other service in London [https://stasher.com/luggage-storage/london/kings-cross](https://stasher.com/luggage-storage/london/kings-cross). They've got storage units all across London, including Charing Cross, where I'll be arriving, and King's Cross, which is the closest spot to all the buildings as well as pubs and restaurants I'm planning on visiting, for work and leisure, respectively. It seems to be priced rather reasonably, is open 24/7, and even offers insurance of up to £1000(which I hope won't be necessary, but is still nice). 

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up, while leaving my bags at stations or even some people I know is theoretically possible, I would still prefer a cheap and flexible alternative for more easy access to my luggage while in London.

Hi there and thanks for taking the time to read this!

My girlfriend and I are traveling to Puerto Vallarta/Sayulita for a couple of weeks. We are going to explore/hike/be adventurous for 90% of the trip and the last few days we are looking into getting an all inclusive resort to relax before heading back to the states.

All inclusive adults only places run about $800 a night in June. So the question is, can I call around a few days to a week out from when we would like to stay and see if I can get a better rate than $800 a night? Has anyone had success or attempted to do this?

I'm a rarity in that I have three passports, and I'm looking for a compact holder for them.

A friend of mine and myself are planning a 6 months trip to southeast Asia starting in September. We're living in France but are basically looking for the cheapest options to Asia so we'd also be ready to move around if the tickets are cheaper from another country.

Our plan is to spend 1 or 2 months in Nepal and then to travel closer to southeast Asia (Indonesia, Borneo, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), or the other way around.

We searched Skyscanner for flights from Paris/Milan/Lyon/Geneva to Kathmandu and New Delhi, but we did not find too many options, and the few we did were one way tickets for around 300€. Is it possible to find anything cheaper, maybe by getting a two ways tickets straight off ?
We are not opposed to travelling for longer in order to get there, but the fewer the layovers the better.

TravelHacks," Hey all, I just recently purchased a flight from smartfares and they've been really putting me through the wringer trying to fix this whole issue. So I bought a round trip flight for Japan Airlines from Chicago to Manila from them because they had the lowest fare and I needed to save some money, but the returning flight included a connecting flight that requires an airport transfer from the Haneda to Narita. However, when I called Japan Airlines to confirm this booking because I always want to stay ahead of stuff especially when it comes to international traveling, they told me that it is not possible for foreigners to make an airport transfer due to ongoing covid restrictions.

I should have put two and two together in my head when I initially saw that there was an airport transfer, but I initially assumed since it was displayed as an available flight on the smartfares website, there shouldn't be any issue with it. The guy I talked with didn't seem to have my best interest in mind either and when I asked for a full refund he said it was out of the question because it's non-refundable and I would have to pay an absurd minimum of 400-500 fee even though I feel like it's kind of their fault as a service for advertising a flight that none of their customers can really even take. I also looked further into the company, which I regrettably should have done in the very beginning and it turns out they're an indian based company despite them being ""headquartered"" in san diego. Definitely seems a little shady, but I found them through google flights.

So what would you guys suggest to do in my situation? I paid through paypal, not sure if they have protection against any of this stuff. I just feel like I'm really being scammed here and they're not willing to take any responsibility as a service for this issue.",Can I get my flight refunded because third party site allowed booking for airport change that is not possible due to covid restriction?,,crossouts,,9,2022-04-24 22:54:21

TravelHacks,"I'm from the US and have a Sprint unlimited plan (it's an old grandfathered plan with supposedly no data speed throttling at least in the US) and every time I've traveled to Europe, I've opted for the $25/week high speed data plan. I rarely make phone calls and if I can recall correctly, the only time I called anyone was on Wifi calling from Athens, but calling a US number. 

I'm traveling to Italy soon and anticipate needing to make phone calls to hotels/restaurants in Italy (i.e. Italian phone numbers) and back home to US phone numbers. 

If I opt not to get an international SIM card (I'm embarrassed to admit I don't understand how these work or how it would make sense with the 2 factor authentication on most apps), I have the following questions:

1) For calling US phone numbers while I'm in Italy, if I turn on Wifi calling, how can I make sure I'm truly using Wifi? Do I just need to toggle ""cellular data"" to be off? 

2) If I were to use Wifi calling to call an Italy number while I'm also in Italy, would this cost the $3/minute as noted on Sprint's website?",Confused about international (Europe) phone options. Embarrassing questions!,,priuspower91,,0,2022-04-24 19:51:23

TravelHacks,"I would like to start by telling you that it is not an advertisement, I am not trying to promote anything, I just want to reveal some of the ""tricks"" that I apply for each DIY holiday

 I often follow the DYI vacation offers proposed by different travel blogs in order to have a start point. If something catches my eye (from the seen ideas) or if I have a specific destination in mind, then it's a match and the ""holiday hunt"" begins.

 The organization of the vacation is divided by me into 3 main categories:

 1. Airline tickets
 2. Accommodation
 3. Tourist objectives


 The most important aspect before starting the ""hunt"" for tickets is anonymity: deleting all cookies and using the incognito mode.  Most of the time, I use a search engine that will show me all the possible options from all the airlines, for example google flights. After discovering the optimal option, I go directly to the airline's website (usually a small fee is also applied through the third party) and choose the plane tickets.  There have been a lot of offers lately, so why not take advantage?  Some examples of purchased tickets: Bucharest (Romania) - Naples (Italy): 2 euros, Bucharest (Romania) - Florence (Italy): 12 euros, Bucharest (Romania) - Athens (Greece): 11 euros. I often check the costs of a plane ticket near my city, namely Craiova (it is a much smaller airport and from time to time they have better prices).  For example, for Bucharest (Romania) - Paris (France) was 500 euros, but for Craiova (Romania) - Paris (France) I paid 40 euros. 


For accommodation I prefer the option through Booking or Airbnb, being cheaper than the hotel.  After finding something profitable, I check all the reviews of the property (be sure to find reviews, so you are not the first person to rent).  It is preferable to rent somewhere close to the tourist objectives you want to visit, so as not to waste time and not to spend a lot of money on transportation. I've never had a problem with renting from Airbnb / Booking.  I’ve rented a single room in an apartment / house, where I practically lived with strangers, but everything was ok.  Examples of found prices (p.s the prices are per night, for each person): Budapest (8 euros), Athens (6 euros), Naples (24 euros).


 Regarding the list of objectives, I often try to look for the recommendations of the locals, because they are the most interesting.  Some important info: there are many tourist attractions where tickets are either free or discounted for students / EU citizens or free on the first Sunday of the month for everyone (to be checked on the site or at the box office). Online purchased tickets are often cheaper and include the ""skip the line"" option, which is perfect.  There is also the card option for tourist (for an extra amount of money, you’ll have access to certain tourist objectives + transport through the city, with a given validity: 2, 3, 4 days).  Sometimes the difference is justified, sometimes not.

 If you have any tips and tricks for ""hunting for a cheap vacation"", I'm all ears!

 TLDR: it could be cheap to go on holiday almost anywhere. If you pay attention to your budget, you can travel even more times than you intended!  :) Good luck hunting!",How to organize vacantions abroad with the lowest possible budget,,Flimsy-Speaker1848,,4,2022-04-23 08:40:59

TravelHacks,"**High crime rate**

Travellers are recommended to be aware of pickpockets and thieves at popular tourists spots, restaurants, and public transport. Pickpocketing, mugging and petty other thefts are recurring concerns on the streets of Istanbul and other regions including the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar and Taksim Square. Travellers are urged to hold their bags tightly by their sides and stay alert to their surroundings.

**Turkish gangs**

Besides pickpocketing, violent crimes are also prominent in the country due to the presence of Turkish gangs. Terrorism has emerged to be a major worry for tourists in recent years due to active attacks on prominent regions in the country.

**Reckless public transport operators**

Local drivers in the country are known to drive recklessly, ignoring important traffic rules and signs. Therefore, it is important for tourists to be cautious while travelling in public transportation to ensure safe travel in the country. Furthermore, taxi drivers often trick customers into paying more or by giving wrongful information about the costs and tourists places.

**Lack of proper health support**

Amid increasing COVID-19 cases in the country, Turkish healthcare infrastructural was deficient and failed to follow regulations. The hassled nature of Turkey’s healthcare system has been unable to provide the necessary healthcare support to infected tourists. Therefore, tourists are advised to avoid travelling to Turkey, particularly in case of possible symptoms of infections, due to the lack of systematic healthcare support.

TravelHacks,"Hello, using a throwaway account because of a lot of specific details.

I'm a US citizen living in Germany. I am resident in Germany and have been here long enough to have a German drivers license. In the process of doing so, I had to hand in my US driver's license. 

We're traveling to Mallorca for 3 weeks in June.  I've got a reservation for a car rental but I haven't paid anything and I'm looking to see if i can find a better one.

I've noticed that, for example, on Avis, if I choose USA as my residence, the price is about $1000USD for a compact for 3 weeks if I pay now. If I switch to Germany and do the search again, I can no longer choose to pay now and the reservation rate goes up to 2500EUR.

The best rate I've found ""as a German resident"" is about 1400EUR with a second driver from OK Mobility, picking up from the airport.

 I can only find a deal as good as the Avis one if I rent in the city and not from the airport. As this is massively inconvenient, I'd only do it for significant cost savings. ~500EUR is pretty significant for me. If the difference were 100EUR I probably wouldn't bother because the convenience difference is too great.

So, how critical is this piece of information? If I book as an American resident and present a German drivers license, will I be screwed? the worst case is booking the inconvenient location and then being forced to pay higher rates than I would have from the airport.",Renting in Spain as American resident of Germany,,throwawaytravel55,,2,2022-04-20 07:00:15

TravelHacks,"My wife and I are in a bit of a strange predicament. Looking to rent a car in a couple of months, but we're hitting some weird things with car rentals. We've tried this at Costco travel and a number of big name sites.

Flying in on a Tuesday and we arrive at around 9AM. Leaving the following Saturday at about 7PM. If we try to rent a car from 9AM Tuesday to 9AM Saturday, car rentals are about 200 dollars for the whole trip, billed at the daily rates.

However, if we try to rent from 9AM Tuesday to 5PM Saturday, it's then considered ""5"" days and we're charged by the week rates instead and it comes out to about $450 which seems ridiculous.

Does anyone have a workaround for this? We really just need the car for that extra 8 hours or so. Happy to pay for the extra day, but would REALLY prefer to pay the daily rates!!",Car Rental Weekly vs Daily Rates,,contagon,,3,2022-04-20 05:01:07

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone! My wife and I just recently returned from an amazing 11 day trip to France. I wanted to share the different ways we used credit card points to pay for the trip. 

Flights:
We each have a Delta Amex Gold card we got a sign up bonus of 60,000 points for. We originally had this trip planned for April 2020 but covid derailed that. At that time we had gotten RT tickets for 30k miles each. This time we couldn't get a good deal so we ended up spending 58,000 miles and then an additional $90 for a Premium Select seat upgrade. 


We'd been accumulating points with our Chase Sapphire Preferred card during the pandemic including a couple of referrals with family and friends. We then decided to upgrade to the Sapphire Reserve and got a 50,000 point bonus as well as 1.5x value for the points. With these points we were able to book a few things. 

Rental Car:
We used the Chase Portal to rent the car through Avis. European gas prices are ridiculous so we opted for the small, hybrid hatchback they had. We ended up spending 20,700 points on the vehicle and we got a free upgrade once we got there. 

Hotels:
The Sapphire Reserve card comes with an annual $300 travel credit which applied to the Airbnb we got in Paris for 7 days and paid the rest of the $1,300. We also stayed in the Eastern part of France in a few hotels. We stayed at a beautiful castle-hotel with its own moat! It was a 4-star hotel in the Champagne region and we paid 12,750 points for one night. We also stayed at a 5-star hotel in Colmar for 2 nights for 37,500 points. It had a 2-star Michelin restaurant in the hotel as well as a spa with a pool, sauna, ice room, hammam and some very comfortable heated chairs. And one more night we stayed in Nancy at a historic hotel for 11,050 points. We definitely could've used our points wiser but they're experiences we wouldn't pay for if we had to use cash. 

Transportation:
Paris has an extensive Metro system as well as a city-sponsored rental bike program as well as Lime/Uber bikes and electric scooters. For these we used the Capital One Venture One card. We had the Venture card for years but we ended up downgrading it so we could use the Reserve card as our daily. But, we had about 14,000 points stored up worth $140 in travel related reimbursements which includes these types of transportation. We ended up spending about $100 between Train tickets and rental bikes and scooters which we redeemed points for and essentially got them for free. 

Having all these things paid for meant that the only thing we had to pay out of pocket for is shopping and eating. With the Sapphire Reserve card you get 3x points on restaurants so we got a good amount of points during the trip between all the pastries and ice cream we ate. 

We definitely could've been more frugal with our points looking back (cheaper hotels, flights and rental car.) But it was a trip we had been waiting for for such a long time so we splurged on some things that we normally wouldn't. But hopefully this have some people ideas on how to use their points for traveling.

Almost *every* time I fly I get sick. Basically, my only chance to not get super nauseous is if I'm on a 2 hr or less flight, and even then it has happened. Dramamine doesn't do much for me. I've gotten Scopalamine patches prescribed before, but I'm *very* allergic to it (I think to the adhesive - big, red, raised rash where the patch goes). Bonine and keeping Nauzene on hand has helped the most, and is what I will resort to if I can't figure something else out.

It's not even just on the flight - even if I make it through the flight alright, I will very often wake up the next day, be good at first, and then quickly decline, get super nauseous, and end up throwing up.

I'm a super anxious person, so I'm probably being a bit paranoid, but I just cannot lose my phone. I cannot afford another one. My friend has gotten along fine, but a few of her study abroad friends have been pickpocketed.

I'm a young, blonde, twenty-something girl with an accent everyone assumes to be American. I know I look like a tourist, lol. But I also grew up in Toronto and have travelled a lot. I just spent a week in NYC clubbing, lots of bars, tourist attractions like Times Square... and I was fine. No pickpockets, no muggings. I think this is because I am a very distrustful person and I'm *always* aware of my surroundings, safe, etc. I'm also not very friendly towards men and not the 'friendly woman' who sometimes gets taken advantage of (not that its their fault! I just know young women are targeted more because sometimes they're too polite to push people away).

So - is it exaggerated? I've never had issues in cities like NYC, Dublin, Toronto, London... so why am I freaking out about Barcelona?

TravelHacks,"Budgeting a Europe Trip (1 month)

Hi everyone, I am a young female traveller planning to visit Portugal, Italy (only for a few days) and Croatia for around a month between May and June. I have booked a majority of my accommodations and travelling (flights, busses, etc) which i assume will be the most hefty expenses of my trip. I have never travelled alone before, let alone in another continent and I just have a general question for those with experience! 

I am bringing around 3-4K (CAD) on the trip and I think that this will be enough to cover the rest of my expenses (groceries, eating out). Since I am on a budget, I don’t plan to spend money frivolously on tourist attractions, eating at expensive restaurants, or doing a lot of shopping. Rather, I plan to just relax, explore by walking around different parks and cities, hiking, taking pictures on my camera, journaling, and doing the things I can do that are for free :) 

Is it naive of me to assume that this amount will be enough to cover general costs? I don’t think groceries will be that crazy expensive and again i reiterate, I do not plan to spend much money on tours, day trips, expensive wine, shopping  or those kinds of things in general. I have also read that portugal and croatia are a few of the cheaper countries to visit in europe.

TravelHacks,"Hi all!  
 

I’m traveling from a European country to Valencia this week (staying for two weeks). In order to make this work, I had to book a self-connecting flight. I’m now starting to question whether I should travel with checked-in luggage or a carry-on. I would prefer checked-in luggage (so I don’t have to think that much about my packing), but I can compromise for not having the chance of missing my other flight haha. 

I have 2 hours and 35 minutes from my plane arrives at Palma (if it arrives on time) till my flight leaves for Valencia. The check-in closes 40 minutes before takeoff, leaving me with 1 hour and 50 minutes to:  
 

Collect my luggage, check-in for the next flight, go through security, etc. I also need to think about possible delays for my first flight.

I’m a somewhat frequent flyer, but I’ve never done a self-connecting flight before. It was a long time since I’ve been at the Palma airport, so I don’t know the airport well. I understand this might be somewhat risky (doing self-connecting flights), so now I’m just thinking about minimizing the risks. 

So what do you guys think, is this enough time to travel with checked-in luggage or should I go with only a carry-on to save me some hustle? Then I don’t need to wait for any luggage or go through security again (since I can stay in the passenger area from my understanding?).

* delta changes a lot of flights at the last minute, sometimes forcing you to miss a connection
* united cancels a lot of flights
* southwest good, but less connections
* spirit bad (i agree with this one, one rly bad experience here)

TravelHacks,"Spirit added a 7-hour layover to each flight on my originally nonstop round trip flight that was 2 hours in June. They’re offering me to accept or cancel for a credit. But the credit for cancelling gives me this message:

“The value of this reservations is less than the application cancellation fee and will have no value.”

I have no clue what that means. Does this mean the fees to change when I rebook with the credit will be even more than the $372 credit from cancellation? The credits expire July 12 and I don’t have other trips to plan for the rest of this year nor do I have the time to take any (unfortunately). There were no other spirit flights nonstop or with even reasonable layovers on my travel dates, so I had to rebook with United for twice as much money at this point.   

I generally fly United, but even when I’d flown Spirit I never had this big of an inconvenience (lesson learned).

Is there anything I can do to get a refund or just not have the credits expire? What can I do?

*DAY 1 
JFK to Milan - Milan for 1 night. We get there pretty early and neither of us have a huge desire to stay there long, so really just looking to rest and reset

*DAY 2-5
Train from Milan to Florence. This is sounding like it'll be our hub. From there, we're planning a couple day trips and are torn between Tuscany, San Gimignano, Montelpuciano, and Modena. Any thoughts on which we must absolutely hit?? 

*DAY 6-7
Train from Florence for Rome. Spend a couple days here exploring before we fly to Santorini

How's this look? Are we cramming too much in?

Also, spend a bit of time exploring Halifax and neighboring areas (we went to Dal, so...nostalgic!)

Cons: 
Costly!
Gas prices!!

Driving will be hectic (but we have three drivers)

TravelHacks,"Hi, 

I am 18, and my family is initially from Vietnam so I will be flying back to visit at the end of August by myself. My timeline doesn’t give a lot for change due to school, I will be flying from Maui, HI to Ho Chi Minh city around August 15 but I have to fly from Ho Chi Minh city back to Minneapolis, MN on September 5. I live in Hawai’i but I go to college in Minnesota. 

As of right now, I am tracking the price for the flight. I’m thinking of buying the tickets around the end of May, and I think I will buy 2 separate tickets because it seems to be cheaper than the multi - city ticket somehow. So I will be buying one ticket to go from Maui -&gt; Vietnam and another from Vietnam -&gt; Minnesota. A lot of the flight have an incredibly short connection time so my choice is quite limited, but I think I have pick out several that will give me a decent chance to transfer, that cost around $1600. 

The thing I’m most anxious about is the tickets because of the transfer time and how limited my options are. Other than that, I am also quite nervous about the customs but I will apply for an eVisa beforehand and do what I gotta do. 

I would really love if you can provide me some advice. The thing I’m really in need of is an estimate layover time. I will generally always have 2 layovers, one within the U.S. and another in a foreign country. I try to leave about 1h30m for domestic and about 3 hours for international, would that be enough to account for delay and custom?

We are struggling with the following:

1) Where do we stay? In Florence or somewhere in the Tuscan countryside with nice views of the hills?

2) Should we rent a car? I'm leaning towards yes but I guess this all depends on where we want to go. We are probably not going to go to Cinque Terre as it seems difficult to do with an 18 month old toddler.

3) Should we do two day trips and two days in Florence or one day trip and 3 days in Florence? There are so many possibilities for day trips e.g. Siena, San Gimignano, Val D'orcia. Is it worth doing a long day trip to like Lake Como?

TravelHacks,"I had one of the worst travel experiences in a long career involving a lot of awful travel - stranded for 36 hours for a transfer in the Las Vegas airport (You may have seen us on the news!) with no lodging or compensation - at the end of it all they offered me a $500 travel credit for their airline.

This is pretty insulting given the price of the original ticket, additional out of pocket expenses due to their being shortstaffed, and lost wages for a job I missed which was the purpose of my flight to begin with.

Do I have any options to try to get a better resolution? Or am I just stuck with whatever pity crumbs they toss me?

I am also a Vegan and need an understanding of how vegan-friendly Venice is. Any vegan restaurants, markets, etc., that you would recommend? I wouldn’t mind eating vegetables and fruits my entire stay haha, but it would be nice to catch decent vegan meals. I also need an understanding of the public transportation.

* Day 7: Salerno to Bologna
* Day 8: Food factory tour in Bologna (full day)
* Day 9: Bologna to Florence

* Day 11: Florence (full day)
* Day 12: Florence to Venice

* Day 14: Venice to Milan
* Day 15: Milan to Airport and back home


For transport, we'll be taking high speed Frecciarossa or Italo trains across cities. I'm not too sure on the transport to Salerno and Amalfi.

4. Any good tips for things I may not think of? Or things that were more complicated than they appeared?

soon I'm setting off for a 10 months trip from Europe to India and I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle my money during this long trip. Obviously I will have my credit card with most of my money on it, but in some countries  - starting from like the sanctioned Iran onwards - my bank does not operate. I guess there are some banks which function globally and perhaps have some benefits on withdrawal pricing, so my first question is whether you can recommend me some? 

Second question is about how much cash should I keep on myself. I thought of getting perhaps 1500€ in notes, mainly bcs it can get me better exchange rate for local money and I won't need to spend for often pricy withdrawals. At the same time, I'm also thinking it's crazy and scary to keep that much on me. What would be the smart way to do this?

I used to stay in Airbnb but have saved up over the past few years and would like to try hotels. I don't really have any status, however I was wondering is there any such thing as being able to call or look up a certain hotel group and get a locked in average night price for a long trip if I stay in a branded property across the countries? I'm basically asking can I call for example Marriott and give them my itinerary across london, paris, switzerland, Italy, etc and say can I find some reservations in these countries for a hotel owned by your group for x dollars per night and book?

TravelHacks,"It's always so exciting to get on a plane or go somewhere you've never been. Even a few days can be good medicine for the body and an ideal recovery for the nerves. I adore traveling and try to get out of the country each vacation. Thus, I've gathered some lifehacks that will be useful for every tourist.

Each journey starts with packing your luggage. It's the most important stage of your holiday preparation. If you don't want to end up with a ruined vacation, take care of a high-quality suitcase. I've purchased [Monos Luggage](https://monos.com/), and after four trips, it hasn't got broken so far. I'd also advise marking your luggage as fragile even if you take only clothes with you. Baggage handlers at the airport are infamous for the rough handling of road cargo. The probability that airport workers will throw your bag carelessly is much less if it's marked as fragile, and your items and the suitcase itself will be protected from unexpected deterioration.

If you travel a lot during your vacations and stay at each place for just a few days, don't unpack everything. Just take what you need. It will save you time to get ready quickly at the last minute.

Another useful travel hack is to keep a $50 bill under the insole. In case you lose your purse or get stolen, you will still have enough money to return the taxi to the hotel and get help. It's a great way to ensure your cash reserve is protected no matter where you are.

Last but not least advice is to use Google Maps offline. Just open the app on your phone when you are connected to the network, find the place you are interested in, then tap on the 3 small dots on your screen and select """"Download Offline Map"""". This little travel life hack is very useful. Thus, you save battery power and can reach the desired destination even with no Internet connection.

TravelHacks,"I’m currently planning my honeymoon and my fiancée and I just decided to make an adjustment. Initially we were planning to do a week in Greece followed by a week in Italy with a few days in Paris to close it out. Once we realized how much moving, flying, hotels, trains etc it would be, it didn’t seem very relaxing. 

Now we are looking at doing our first week/10 days in Greece and then heading to the Caribbean for a week at a luxury resort. We would like to have a week of Greek culture, historical sites, travelling town to town, followed by a week of complete relaxation at an all inclusive. 

Here are our trip details:
-Departing from Toronto on October 3rd 2022
-budget for total trip (flights, hotels, meals, spending money) is $15k
-Planning for Santorini/Mykonos while in Greece
-Looking for AI in St Lucia, Antigua, Aruba, etc - not interested in Mexico/Jamaica/Cuba/Dominican

Key Questions
-is this a good idea given flight distance and potential lack of direct flight from Athens to Antigua, for example (any tips on booking this flight would be appreciated)
-if anyone has gone on a trip like this, how did it go? Would you recommend it?
-recommendations for all inclusive resorts - ideally 5 star with a butler option
-any other tips/suggestions so we can get the most out of our trip would be appreciated.

Fast forward to now. Japan isn’t open and we have to reschedule. 

The four of us canceled our tickets due to travel restrictions on March 3, 2022. 

Air Canada said we would be issued travel vouchers for the cost of our tickets - minus taxes and fees - and they would arrive between 6 to 8 weeks. 

To our surprise. On March 8th we received two travel vouchers via email. (My girlfriend and I booked our trip separately. Hence the two vouchers) They were supposed to have over $1,800 on them. There was nothing on them and it says the ‘funds have been depleted’ but we’ve yet to use them. 

We’ve sent emails and even tweeted at them. Nothing. 

We’ve called them 5 or 6 times. Each time they’ve said to wait 3 business days for the funds to show. Still nothing. 

Supposedly two customer service agents have sent urgent requests to whatever department that handles our stuff. Nothing. 

They just hung up on her after being on a call for over an hour. So frustrated. 

We’re worried we might be out of $1,800. Can they do that? Has anyone experienced this before? Or is going through it now?

TravelHacks,"Hello people, 

I am not sure if anyone has any idea about my case but willing to hear from you people if you have any opinion on what happened with me!

So, basically back in December around the new year, I had a flight to Paris, and the flight was through Edinburg UK (transit point). my passport does not qualify me to pass the UK even through transit point without a visa but because I hold a permanent residency card of another country (which is listed under UK official website for visa) that the holder of this card can pass only through transit point (which was my case) without the need to present visa as long as they do not cross the border (which is my case too)

&amp;#x200B;

when I was checking in first, the border agent did complain about this until she checked online and made some calls then, she decided (which I thought it is totally not relevant to Ryanair because I asked about the visa requirement and they told me on the phone that it is not them who decide! even though I was according to the UK website fully legally to transit!) to give me the boarding pass and I checked in my bag and finished everything **BUT** when I reached the gate, she came to me and she did not let me go on the plane because she said, ''RYAN AIR HAS DECIDED TO NOT LET YOU FLY ON THIS PLANE BECAUSE OF THE VISA!'' I was shocked and I saw the flight in front of my eyes leaving! 

&amp;#x200B;

I did book another flight that day because I already had many other reservations in Paris that were nonrefundable too, and I filed two complaints so far about the company getting refunded for the money but ended up with nothing and they have not contacted me yet! 

&amp;#x200B;

is there any solution to get my money back because I was totally right and never done anything wrong to be treated this way and not able to fly with them!!",Ryanair refund claim,,lucass1997,,11,2022-03-17 12:44:13

TravelHacks,"So Im used to going places and renting cars for decent amounts - PRE pandemic. But now...? I and almost everyone are paying out of the ASS. Tell me, how much longer is this ""chip shortage"" going to last....? Because Im tired of \[now\] paying at least $460 a week for a fucking car and sometimes $515 (as it's the cheapest I can find for one week in May). I live out of state and liked to visit my home state every other month for 3-4 days. Now, it cost so much that I could literally finance a used and pay to keep it at the airport for TWO months the same amount as id pay to rent from the airport for ONE week. That alone just blows my mind. 

I mean what the actual fuck....? Nevermind rentals elsewhere, like in Alaska that went from $380/week last year to $1100 a week THIS year - yes thats the cheapest there is on Turo while last year $380 was from the airport. And for SUVs...? Yeah, theyre $1700 a week this summer, but were $420-480 a week last summer.

Im just fed up with this shit. Clearly dealersbips and the whole industry is just out there trying to butt fuck every american, and theyre likely putting fewer cars out there to try to choke the supply so that everyone just pays more for less.

I understand there's an additional fee for long-distance one-way drop-offs. Any tips on how to bring this price down though? I'd say $2000 seems ideal.

TravelHacks,"Hello! A friend and I are travelling to Morocco next Monday and I’m wondering if anyone has some light to shed on the vague language used to describe the PCR test window within the Moroccan travel requirements.
  
Our itinerary is to fly within Canada to a larger airport, then to Paris, and finally to Casablanca. The total trip will take about 18 hours. For the PCR tests available to us, the turn around time for results is 24-48 hours.
  
Does the 48 hour window for negative PCR tests apply to our first leg of the trip within Canada, or apply to the flight into Morocco from Paris? If we qualify once we begin travel in Canada, we’ll get a test two days before so we can guarantee our results by the time we reach Moroccan customs. If it applies to the later flight, we’ll have to get it one day before travel and pray our results don’t get delayed.

Any help would be very much appreciated!","Travelling to Morocco, would love some help with the vague language around PCR testing windows",,Cork_in_your_neck,,7,2022-03-11 20:03:08

TravelHacks,"Hello, Reddit! 

Apologies in advance, if I'm posting this in the wrong place. My friend and I are trying to plan a road trip to hit some national parks near the west coast area and around. We're planning to fly out from New England (probably Boston) to Wyoming or Arizona. We would like to rent a one-way camper van or RV (or even a car, we're not picky!) and then drive across the states and end our trip in either Wyoming or Arizona, and fly back home. Or just flying out to Wyoming and traveling to Oregon to California and back again. We have about 3.5 weeks mapped out.

We're looking for some creative ideas, as renting can be very expensive and we're struggling to find any rentals that are affordable. We're fine with camping in tents anywhere and sleeping in the van/car. We're even semi-willing to take a bus route from place to place if that's an option available to us. So, Reddit, we're coming to you to see if you have any creative ideas to help us accomplish this trip. Also, any advice or wisdom that you have to offer! We're two young women and this is our first trip like this, so we want to be as safe and affordable as possible! We're willing to be creative with it all, so come at us with your ideas, please!",Transportation Struggles,,HandVast6301,,1,2022-03-05 14:42:54

Anyone else had experience with this ? I’m thinking of investing in a decent size travel backpack and using that. It should pay off on the long run having to not pay an additional €22 per trip just to take my bag with me.

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone,

So I have a mix between an ethical and a practical question.

I am staying in a hostel in Honolulu and, being paranoid about such situations, had booked my accommodations well in advance.

My little brother (19) just arrived for a weekend trip (he lives temporarily on Big Island, so not far), and he'll be staying from today until the 6th. 

I just learned he did not book anything, despite me reminding him several times, and now literally everything is full that costs less than $270USD/night. 

So my question is whether anyone might know of a safe place in Honolulu for him to sleep for cheap on such short notice, and if they don't, how bad would it be for me to let him into the hostel courtyard to spend the night so he's at least not on the literal streets overnight? Also, would it be better to ask for forgiveness from the hostel if he's caught, or be honest and ask for permission to let him stay in the courtyard?

The weather is always nice, so him being outside is not a problem. I just want to make sure he's safe because he's my little brother, so I am looking for perspectives. To make the best of a bad situation.

Thank you.",Stuck in Honolulu with nowhere to sleep,,lucasg115,,8,2022-03-05 05:20:05

Also, I'd recommend buying access rather than a subscription checking the  reviews, since some of the subscription discount stuff on Groupon comes with hidden fees and sneaky recurring charges or exclusions that would make you not want to sign up if they were more upfront.  


Coupon code I used is ""missyou"" in case anyone wants to take a look at this, though the coupon codes change up from time to time.   


You can also sometimes get some additional savings by using a rebate/cashback website, such as Rakuten, in my case I got 4% back, which was just under $1. If you don't have an account w/ them look for someone's referral code, which will give you some additional $ for the first time you use it ($30 usually). Also good because you can stack that with cashback or points on a credit card.","If you want to go to an airport lounge in the US, but don't have free/discounted access through a credit card or other means, check Groupon.

- Clothes and carry on? I wanna be as efficient as possible and not over pack, open to buying warm clothes over there as I know my wardrobe likely won't be warm enough to survive that weather, might bring thermals to wear under everything
- Items it MUST bring and items I shouldn't
- This to remember at airports
- Cash conversion (I will likely be organising a travel car)

TravelHacks,"Many of us still have unused American Airlines flight credits that are due to expire on 3/31/2022. Per the Reservations Agent that helped me tonight, American Airlines is no longer extending COVID-related Flight Credits as of 2/15/22. However, there is a workaround that will cost a small sum of money and will convert the Flight Credit to the far-superior Trip Credit!

[https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/payment-options/travel-credit.jsp#flightcreditterms](https://www.aa.com/i18n/customer-service/payment-options/travel-credit.jsp#flightcreditterms)

This link will take you to the terms and conditions for Flight Credits. Under one of the bullet points under ""Redemption and usage"" says ""If the ticket price is less than the value of the Flight Credit, you can only use the value of Flight Credit needed for the current booking **while remaining value will be issued as travel credit for future reservations**."" (it is also good for one year from the date of issuance - i.e., you get a year extension). Therefore, book a super cheap one-way ticket and immediately get a TRIP CREDIT for the remaining balance of your credit good for an entire year! Just keep in mind, when/if you cancel this cheap flight, the cost of that flight will be credited back and will expire with the original expiration date (e.g., 3/31/2022). This is a small price to pay to have the credit converted to a TRIP CREDIT and extended one full year!

I found the cheapest one-way flight available in the US via Google Flights and went to [AA.com](https://AA.com) to book it! For a measly $45, book ATL to MIA on 3/16/2022 (there are multiple flights/times with that low price).

When I went to pay with the Flight Credit, the system says I cannot redeem this credit online, I must call... So I put the flight on hold (d**on't pay for it! just select 'hold'**) and called and got it taken care of! (don't tell them you plan on missing/cancelling the flight! they don't like that)

**So, to recap:**

I started with $500 Flight Credit expiring on 3/31/2022

I booked ATL to MIA on 3/16/2022 for $45 online, making sure to pay with the credit, or if that did not work, I put the reservation on HOLD.

I called reservations and told the agent I wanted to pay for the flight with the flight credit.

Reservations paid for the $45 flight with the flight credit and issued me a new trip credit.

Now I have a Trip Credit worth $455 and expires 3/2/2023!!!",AA Flight Credit expiration workaround,,llbrandonsmithll,,11,2022-03-02 04:19:48

There are 4 of us flying.  If we do this, should we notify the gate agent as a courtesy that we don't intend to fly on to City X?  I figure this way they can ticket any stand-by passengers sooner rather than later.

TravelHacks,"The Problem: 
Global Entry appointments can be as soon as same day or next year. Some cases never. 

A tip:
Some of us live near more than one airport. For example in Seattle we have access to SeaTac and then Portland isn’t tooo far away if necessary; Bay Area has SFO, Oakland, San Jose.. you get the drift. 

A “tip” while searching appointments is to look at multiple locations if you can. Think of your upcoming travel plans to determine if you’ll be able to visit a global entry office while traveling - it’s possible to score a sooner appointment elsewhere. 

The “hack:” 
I created a bot that looks at all global entry locations and shares its next available appointment to Twitter… all day long. All you have to do is watch for your locations next appointment, and if it’s sooner than your current slot, confirm the new one as quickly as possible and then cancel your existing appointment. Creating this scored me a same-day appointment at SFO back in 2019!

I can't imagine that there are no cheaper options for Americans that know where to search (maybe local car rentals). Anything close to NYC or Philadelphia would be great. All tips are welcome! Thank you in advance :D!

TravelHacks,"Hi! I'm travelling to New York for the first time and I would like to ask advice on two main things (1) transportation and (2) covid protocols.

(1) I've been to California before, but it's arranged trip so I haven't really tried US public transpo. How do I go from airport to Manhattan? Where do I get a MetroCard? How do I refill it? Can I go anywhere with just the MetroCard?

(2) Do I have to pre-book all places I plan to visit? Where can I get an RT-PCR (for the trip going home) and how much?

These are my main concerns, but if you have advice/suggestions on something else that's related, please feel free to comment. I haven't travelled since COVID so I'm sort of anxious to travel again.

Edit: Add question (3) Do you think I can now start booking plane and accommodation as early as now, or should I wait at a closer date in case travel protocols change?",First Time in NYC,,iamluxi,,21,2022-02-22 11:38:17

I am planning a trip in April from Austin, Texas to start a two week backpacking trip in Dublin. I have never been overseas before and I could use tips on developing a gameplan to backpack from Dublin to Rome, Italy.  I would fly in and out of Dublin.  I would love to see Dublin, London, Rome and Amsterdam.  A few questions...

* Should I rent a car or can I get around within two weeks on train/bus?  
* Is two weeks enough time to make a memorable vacation?
* What are some places to avoid?
* What are some must see places ?

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone! 👋 

I'm a remote worker and my husband is a business owner‐ so we have some flexibility to do extended travel. 

I am looking into doing a 30 or 60 day trip, short term living abroad. My preference right now I to just stay in one country, but I'm open.

I've considered Seoul, a couple of areas in Italy, and even Tokyo.

I am curious, for anyone who has done this, what cities/countries are your preference for families (we have a 3 and 7 year old)? Also did you find deals with extended hotel stays or did you utilize something like AirBnB?

In addition, I am aware I may need Visas depending on the country/length of stay...but is there anything else I need to consider?

TravelHacks," Havasu Falls has been a well magical place that has been featured on several calendars as well as screensavers, as well as on television, magazines, and the internet. Hiking to Havasu Falls is indeed a bucket-list activity for experienced hikers mostly on hunt for the hike of a lifetime, and it’s excellent for a night time car trip to or from Lake Havasu City. There are indeed hiking plus helicopter trips offered. Havasu Falls is frequently contrasted with Lake Havasu, which is situated on the Havasupai Indian Reservation which is just outside Grand Canyon National Park. Both of these are gorgeous water wonderlands, but getting to the trailhead for Havasu Falls from Lake Havasu City takes four to five hours. Hiking to Havasu Falls seems to be a ten-mile downhill journey from the trailhead to the waterfall. Because the route is difficult, hikers must be in amazing physical shape. Hiking to Havasu Falls may seem like a huge amount of work; however the reward is definitely worth it. Havasupai is a Native American word that means “people of the blue-green waters.” Havasu Falls cascades over 100 feet into a huge pool of crystal-clear, vivid blue-green water.

I always pack for a two night trip I pack at least four outfit option incase I need to change in case of a mess or malfunction. I always pack a first aid kit a mini sewing kit some times I will even pack an emergency road side kit. And at least one extra pair of shoes. 

On top of that I am a rather fickle person so I can change my mind so I always pack at least two options for my make up or skin care. I always bring my own pillow case and slippers/fuzzy socks. 

Then there are the basic toiletries. So yeah not a light packer for even just a three day two night trip which is what we are planning.  To top if off we are going to a Ballet so I have to pack a nicer outfit as well and bring my jewelry which I don't usually bring along.

Wow had a shuttle bus to NYC (Port Authority Bus Terminal), but the traffic can be very bad on weekdays heading into NYC in the evenings and it's 10 long blocks from there to Penn Station.

Here's the hack:

Stewart Airport is a 20 minute drive from Metro North's Campbell Hall train station, and catching an Uber is pretty easy. For the trip to NYC-- you need to fly in on a weekend as there are no evening trains from Campbell Hall to New York City on weekdays (there's one train that leaves Campbell Hall at 10:04 PM). The flights from Iceland are scheduled to arrive at 5:35 pm-- on Sat and Sun there's two evening trains to NYC leave Campbell Hall at 6:07 and 9:20 PM. If your flight gets in early (which was most of the time for Wow) and you can get through customs expeditiously, you'll have no problem connecting with the 6:07 train. If you miss it, there's one more train.

Taking the train \*to\* Stewart Airport is easier: the daily flight will leave at 6:45 pm. The train originates at the NJ Transit Hoboken, NJ station and you can connect with it at NJ Transit Secaucus Junction station (connects with New York City Penn Station trains and all other NJ trains, except for Atlantic City service)-- service on this line is infrequent but the 2:52 pm train from Secaucus will get you there in plenty of time. On weekends, the trip to Stewart by train is worse--you need to catch the 12:35 pm from Secaucus and change trains in either Ridgewood or Suffern to get into Campbell hall at 3:03 pm.","European low-cost aviation startup Play Airlines to serve New York City via Stewart Airport (Newburgh, NY)",,smdanes,,0,2022-02-03 19:35:49

So we took a $1,600 voucher for our tickets. They have since extended the voucher redemption period twice. 

It’s almost two years later and flight prices are more than 2x the cost. That’s not even considering we now need 3 full priced tickets because our child will be over the age of 2 when traveling now. 

After calling, DMing on Twitter and emailing for weeks, customer service finally told us that we aren’t eligible for a refund because we were offered a refund in 2020 and chose a voucher. That is not true. We were never offered a refund at any point because we would’ve taken it in a heart beat!

TravelHacks,"I misunderstood the terms of the flight credit, and thought I only needed to book travel by the expiration date, but that seems to not be the case. I’ve researched options, and there seem to be two:

 1. E-mail customer support (I’ve done this), and ask for an extension.
 2. Book the cheapest travel I can, and get an evoucher for the remainder.

Option 1 would be ideal, but I’m concerned because the auto-response e-mail says 7-10 days I’m risking the entire amount by waiting, but I also see folks on this sub indicating they’re having success getting it extended through December.

Option 2 would cost me some $, but the tickets themselves would still maintain 80-90% of their value based on the cheapest flights I’ve found so far. (anyone know of a website that will tell you an airlines current cheapest routes?). From what I’ve read the vouchers issued would expire in roughly a year. Is that what folks are seeing?

At any rate, I’m not sure if there’s a 3rd option out there? Has anyone had an extension denied? It’s a non-trivial amount of money at risk here, so I wonder if I should just take the hit and buy the cheap ticket?

**Update:**

I spoke with a second AA rep and it looks like:

a) all tickets that were set to expire 1-31 have been extended through 3-31,  so I have a bit more time to sort out what to do. Additionally it seems that customer care should be willing to extend the credit through the end of the year. 

b) If, for some reason they aren’t willing to extend the date, I can purchase some really cheap fare (or not, If I want to travel somewhere before 3-31), and will receive the travel credit as described earlier, and it will have a +1 year extension.

Details on the extension:

TravelHacks,"In Mexico for the first time but now packing to go home. Stayed at a great resort, however, our hotel room unfortunately had a bunch of ants. Didn’t bother me much as I understand that I am in a tropical climate. I’m packing my luggage and realized there was a tiny ghost ant in it, in fact there are probably a few. I probably will not be going through the trouble of shaking out all of my clothes because these ants are so tiny and barely noticeable, however I DO not want a colony to start in my apartment back home where it is very cold. So, my plan is to get home late, around 12 AM (when my flight gets in) and then leave my luggage in my car for about 10 hours and then immediately take it to the laundry room that is separate from my apartment in the morning when I wake up. If I leave my luggage in the car for 10 hours at 24 degrees Fahrenheit will that be enough to kill these stray ants? Plus they will be away from their colony and hopefully a queen is not in my luggage. In my mind, they are used to tropical weather and might not be able to make it through the cold night in the North where I am from. I am not used to dealing with bringing back bugs from holiday because this is my first time out of the country. What do you usually do to make sure you don’t bring any pests home from a foreign country? Please advise!!

However, my current backpack that I use is pretty basic feature-wise and also… approximately 7 years and hundreds, if not thousands, of day-uses old. Does anyone have a travel pack they recommend? Preferred but not required features are: separate laptop compartment that fits 16” machine, tech pockets, good organization, water bottle holder, suitcase style zipping.

I have spent an insane amount of time researching this dream pack and come across a lot of contenders that are close but not exactly what I want.

Currently without points I have a round trip, first class departure to Hawaii, and main cabin back home (Seattle)with our voucher priced at $1196

I got a Hawaiian airlines credit card with the deal of spend $2k get 60k miles, $4k- 80k miles, and also offers the first time 50% off a couch companion ticket. 
Earning the miles will be no problem paying for wedding expenses and bookings. 

The website is telling me it will take 320,000 miles for 2 first class tickets, or $681/ticket + 160,000 miles total for 2 first class tickets. 


My goal is to travel hack this into 2 first class flights, and possibly be able to used our Hawaiian airlines gift certificate on the rental car instead.

I just got into Thailand with a covid test that had these 3 times mentioned, and only the ""reported time"" was within the 72hr window. Any time I've asked when travelling to another country, the airline and the covid testing center will say that it's only the ""reported time"" that matters.

It's hard to get a direct answer from CDC.gov, but there is a part of the site which says:
""All air passengers 2 years or older with a flight departing to the US from a foreign country at or after 12:01am EST (5:01am GMT) on December 6, 2021, are required show a negative COVID-19 viral test result taken no more than 1 day before travel, or documentation of having recovered from COVID-19 in the past 90 days, before they board their flight.""

The keyword here is ""taken"". But given my experience with entering other countries, and talking to testing centers and airlines, it's not when the results are ""taken"" but it's when they're ""reported"". Maybe it's entirely dependent on the mood of the agent, I don't know.

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone. I've just landed a job where I'll be flying round trip to a new US city for 1-2 weeks at a time, at least once a month, up to three times a month. The company will pay for all travel, hotels, and rental cars, but all bookings will be under my name, so I'll be the one getting all the points. I plan to stay in this position for at least a year. I start about a month from now in mid-February.

What advice would you have for someone in my situation? I'm assuming I should do my best to fly the same airline every time to maximize points. Is there one airline that is better than others that I should try for? What are your top picks for hotels/car rentals with the best rewards programs?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

EDIT - Adding some further details that may be helpful.

Home airport: Salt Lake City. I don't anticipate visiting any other airports regularly, the job takes me all over the place - not likely to be in the same city more than once or twice.

I don't currently have any travel/award credit cards, so I'll be starting from scratch. I'll be given a company card for expenses, so it's not likely that I'll get very many points on a personal card anyway.

Personal travel priorities/goals: I'd like to get as many miles as possible so I can take some free flights later on. Upgrades would be nice, but are a low priority for me - I'd rather book more free flights with crappy seats instead of spending all my points on upgraded seats. Hotel/rental car points for free nights and transportation would be great as well.",Advice for a Soon-to-be Frequent Business Traveler?,,fuzzthegreatbambino,,53,2022-01-14 06:24:27

TravelHacks,"Traveling has always been a HUGE part of my life. In my 30 (short) years, I've lived in four countries across three continents and traveled to more than 30 countries throughout the world. Through traveling, I've learned to adapt to different societal systems each vastly different from the other and I've been exposed to multiple cultures each with their own values. I've experienced what it's like to start from scratch multiple times, and it's been hard. I'm not going to lie. It's also been tremendously rewarding. The experiences I otherwise would not have been exposed to had I not traveled have exponentially increased my internal growth in a much shorter amount of time and greatly shaped my own perspective and values on life. I've learned what it's like to be an outsider in a foreign land as well as a privileged insider that fits in. I've been in places where my money took me so far to the point that I even felt a bit like royalty. I've also been in places where my money felt like peanuts and I'd never felt more broke. Most importantly, travel has heightened my self-awareness by pushing me out of my comfort zone and placing me in situations where I had to turn inwards and truly get to know myself. Through loneliness, I discovered contentment with solitude, through privilege, I discovered empathy, through financial stability, I was able to make space and discover my purpose. I can go on and on, but I'll stop here for now. It's been a privilege to tap into these esoteric experiences, and I'd love nothing more than to share a part of this with you. I've decided to have a flight giveaway where you can have the opportunity to book your own trip to a place your heart desires. Watch this video to find out how you can participate! 📷

TravelHacks,"I'm traveling to the US this month. I have a chronic, pre-existing condition and I take medication for the same. I checked all the top travel insurance companies — Seven corners, Atlas America, CoverAmerica,  Patriot  America, etc. All don't cover pre-existing conditions, only the acute onset. They told me since I'm on treatment, my eligibility to get coverage in the event of an acute onset will be decided by the claim officer. Seems like any insurance I choose, I'll pretty much get the same deal.

I don’t normally get anxiety day to day and have it under control but traveling alone does trigger it for me.

TravelHacks,"Okay, first, I would like to say this isn't me, it's a close friends family, but I said I would see if Reddit had any information on the subject. They are a older retired couple who booked a trip from Ohio to Florida for their entire family (10 people) in December. This was a huge expenditure for them, and they sadly, did not purchase travel  insurance. Well, 6 people in their party got Covid the week before they were set to travel and so they contacted Spirit to cancel and were told they had to use their travel vouchers before March. Has anyone been successful in having voucher dates extended? There is no way they can travel before then as there are 4 school age children in the group. 

Again, I am just trying to gather info for them. I do know that Spirit sent them to the complaint site, where they filed a complaint, but they have not heard back. This couple stretched a bit of money from the sale of a home to take their whole family on a vacation and now it looks like it might be lost, just trying to help them out if I can.

TravelHacks," M (23) from the UK. I am currently living at home and I work full time in an office job. I am feeling a bit lost at the moment, not really sure what I am working towards or what I want to do in life. Me and my girlfriend have spoken about going travelling quite a lot, it's definitely something I would like to do, but I don't want to go travelling and then come back and have no money behind me. I don't have a great deal of savings behind me, so I can not really afford to rely on that.

I know a guy who's job allowed him to work remotely from anywhere, so he recently moved to Bali for the foreseeable, whilst still working. Does anyone know of any jobs you can do from your laptop, which you can do anywhere? I have thought about voice acting, I already have the equipment, I would just need some training and of course, the talent lol.

Does anyone else know of any other careers/jobs I could look into? I am quite experienced with content marketing, specifically video editing. If anybody knows of any companies that support this kind of work, I'd really appreciate learning more.

I am not looking for a high paying job, in fact, I would be happy to take a large pay cut. I just want something reliable which would support me whilst I travel.",Remote work whilst travelling?,,shouldbekipping,,14,2022-01-06 10:52:05

Hello,

Could anyone explain or find an English language translation of this document that explains what is meant by the following?

People who have recovered from Covid-19 an have performed a PCR test with a positive result for Covid-19 no less than 11 days and up to 3 months before the flight, will be eligible to get a permit to board the plane upon presentation of the test certificate with the positive result and without the need for an exceptions committee. Click here for more information about the committee's decision. ([https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/news/border\_closing\_coronavirus\_14062020/he/pcr\_200921.pdf](https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/news/border_closing_coronavirus_14062020/he/pcr_200921.pdf))

Does this apply to citizens only or general travel? Does this mean that if you catch COVID during the prescribed time you can just hop on the plane? I am unsure given the presentation of this information--though I suspect not.

TravelHacks,"I’m planning a trip to Denmark and Norway In Mid May. I was wondering if anyone has experience traveling between the two countries and how local transportation works within them (buses/local trains). From what I’ve read, both countries are very organized but expensive. Right now, a rough plan would be to ferry from Copenhagen or Hirtshals to Oslo, after exploring Denmark (a long journey but seems cool). Then take the Norwegian railway from Oslo to Bergen, and from there travel north. A few locations I want to explore is the Lofoten Islands and a few fjords/national parks and smaller communities. 

I would love some tips on saving time or money on transportation. 


Is it an insane thought, to think I can befriend some fisherman and catch a ride up the coast a few hours?



TLDR: I want to see as much of the natural landscapes, and less touristy parts of Denmark/Norway as possible in 3 weeks without spending too much or all of my time traveling.",Scandinavian transportation.,,Fa-lalalalala,,10,2021-12-30 17:51:35

TravelHacks,"I make no promises, but finding cheap flights is a hobby of mine :) 

Edit 3? : gonna work on some more after work!!! It’s also really helpful if you know the main airports in the region. Ie: “I’m going to Athens, 2 main sirorts by there are Berlin and Barcelona” or whatever (… I know Spain isn’t that close. But Ryanair, lol) 

And! If you ever so inclined and use a flight I find, and you’re willing and able, throw a few bucks toward the Multiple Myeloma Foundation—- the type of cancer my dad passed of. He gave me the confidence to travel alone, always leaning into the fact that anything is possible :)

edit: please include how long or how soon or how many layovers you can stand... a little guidance is best!

Edit 2:
I responded with this to a question below, but here is the process I use:

I don't have a perfect system, but this is what I usually do:

    Within the USA:

There are many, many small, budget airlines that do not show up on search engines. I like to look at Allegiant Airlines, Frontier, Breeze Airways, Spirit (especially if I'm trying to get out west!)

For example: If I want to go CVG - PDX, I know I can't take a direct flight.

I'll see what Google Flights and Skyscanner says, and then I'll look up a one way from CVG to LAS on Spirit, because I know that Spirit is based out of Vegas and they have flights from Cincinnati frequently.

Thennnn I'll look LAS - PDX.

Sometimes the 2 Spirit tickets cost less than whatever Delta said. Sun Country airlines is also a great one, they are based out of MSP (Minneapolis).

So I often also look at CVG - MSP - PDX, seeing if Sun Country Airlines or Spirit is better.

The process is tedious, but the prices can vary a lot and it is worth it to me, as a college student.

If it is a longer trip, I would look at flying out of close airports, as that can change the price a bunch. Generally speaking, I've found that the bigger the airport, the cheaper, but there are obviously exceptions to the rule.

Within Europe OR USA to Europe; Europe to USA:

RyanAir is my best friend ever. Double check where the airport is, as some of their airports are far from the city center. But I personally don't think you can beat a 10 euro flight. RyanAir is based out of Dublin, so if you are looking to go to the states/North or South America, You can often find a cheap flight to Dublin or London, and then cross the ocean Dublin - New York, Chicago, etc.



BUDGET AIRLINES:

Spirit, Allegiant, and Fronteir often have 20 dollar off codes floating around. I always make sure to search for one before I book anything.

Random stingy thing I do:

After I have decided on my flights, if it is a major airline like Delta or United, I will buy a gift card online for that airline. I use cardcash.com and have not had any issues as a seller or buyer. So, I'll buy a 50 dollar gift card at 5% - 10% off. Obviously this is only a few bucks, but hey, it adds up over time.



TLDR:

If you are looking to cross an ocean and/or will need 2-4 flights to get to your destination, fly to the closest huge airport via cheap airline. (ie LAX, ORD)

Thennnnnn fly from big city to europe or whatever.

If you are going somewhere more obscure, it might be worth it to fly from EWR to Dublin and thennnnnn your destination, rather than EWR to destination that Google Flights says, as you could go from Dublin to Athens (for example) via RyanAir.

Google Flights is your best friend, Skyscanner is alright. I would also rec connecting your Delta account to your Lyft (...or Uber,, but I think it is lift) account, as you get miles for spending money on the app.",I really enjoy finding cheap flights! Give me your search and I’ll see what I can do.,,EveningTomorrow9612,,235,2021-12-29 16:13:58

The cheapest I can find is around $1600 round trip for us both. I was expecting to pay around $1000 so I guess my question is, is $1000 for two adults round trip even feasible?

TravelHacks,"With a lot of uncertainty about travel this coming year, what's a smart way to structure a trip to minimize sunk costs that may be created by the exigencies of the pandemic? 

I've broken my trip down into the following four buckets: 

*  ""major"" flights - into and out of the designated travel region 
* ""minor"" flights - connecting me between different trip destinations
* accommodations 
*  on the ground activities - what I'm there to do and see! 

My sense is to try to book the major two flights with the same carrier (bringing them onto the same gauge and policies, so to speak). Minor flights seem to be an unavoidable sunk cost. 

Maybe stick to AirBNB for accommodations, with some of the more flexible booking policies?  

Anything else to take note of here, seasoned travelers? Would extra insurance, any pertinent travel credit cards, etc. help build in more flexibility?

TravelHacks,"**TLDR -** Timeshare companies sell heavily discounted promotional packages to get you to sit in on a timeshare presentation. If you make sure to not buy a timeshare, this is a great way to take a cheap vacation.

Last week I managed to snag a suite (full kitchen, separate bedroom, massive bathroom) on the Las Vegas strip that would’ve normally cost almost $800, for only $167 and this is a strategy a lot of people can use to cut your travel costs significantly. I also made a video covering this if you prefer video/audio, but all the same information is down below [https://youtu.be/Xoaef3WbFlk](https://youtu.be/Xoaef3WbFlk)

So how can you get a massive discount on hotel stays so you can travel more often? Timeshare presentations. In my case, Hilton’s timeshare branch, Hilton Grand Vacations was offering a promotion of 3 nights plus 25,000 Hilton Honors points for only $149 plus taxes. The only catch was that my wife and I were required to attend a 2-hour timeshare presentation. Now the points alone were almost worth the cost of the promotion so buying this deal was a no brainer (we have been trying to take a vacation for a while now, but our jobs kept getting in the way). Now while this specific deal is one of the best I’ve seen recently, there is always some variant offered by Hilton Grand Vacations, even if it costs a little more or gives you fewer points But Hilton isn’t the only major brand to offer such an insanely discounted vacation package in exchange for you attending a presentation. Doing a quick Google search, here are some of the other timeshare promotion offers out there right now:

Every single one of these offers gives you a steep discount on what it would cost to normally stay at one of these properties usually anywhere from 50-75% off. While it’s a great deal to take advantage of, they come with some drawbacks to consider.

First, not everyone will be able to take advantage of the promotions because many of them have a minimum income requirement. The companies don’t want to advertise to someone who can’t afford to buy a timeshare in the first place. If you have a middle-class income or above this shouldn’t be an issue. Each company will have different requirements, so you’ll need to do some digging to see which offers are a right fit for you.

Additionally, you won’t be able to book these promotional offers repeatedly within a short period of time. Hilton Grand Vacations for example has a 12-month minimum separation between the booking of the promotional packages.

Finally, the biggest drawback is the timeshare presentation you must attend. They aren’t offering these promotions just to help you vacation more, they want to sell you a timeshare. Any losses they experience by discounting their properties is more than made up with the revenue generated by timeshare sales. If they can convince you to buy in, then not only have they locked you in with the initial purchase price, but they can count on future income with the HOA dues you’ll be paying every single year.

If you can go into the presentations knowing you won’t buy a timeshare, and won’t be convinced by the numerous discounts and deals they offer, these vacations promotions are a great way to make your dollar go further with your vacation budget. That’s not to say that all timeshares are bad, for some people they are a perfect way to save money on vacations (typically retirees), but it should never be a spur of the moment purchase.

Even if you stand firm on not buying a timeshare, they may offer additional vacation promotions to get you in front of a presentation again in the future. From my vacation last week, I was able to buy another promotion that’ll cover seven nights in Hawaii for less than 50% of what it would’ve cost normally. So maybe some good can come out of a timeshare presentation anyway.",Get Lodging for Cheap,,APennyPinchersGuide,,1,2021-12-24 18:52:42

Couple days back I came across the Chase Sapphire credit card to collect points and then transfering them to Emirates etc. There is one issue related to a fact that I am not from US hence cannot apply for the credit card.

Reason for need:
- travelling regularly due to my job nature - flights to Middle east
- booking hotel regularly 
- dinning out regularly

For reasons above it is a shame not to have a credit card to get some points.. Majority of my flights are with Emirates, Qatar, Lufthansa, Air France

**On The Land** 

Most of the countries in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) lie in the Northern Hemisphere and the Western Hemispheres. The continent has 32 independent countries. Most of the continent is covered by three nations which are Canada, USA and Mexico. Canada is the largest country in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) by area as it covers 9.985 million km² making it the second-largest country in the world after Russia. Saint Kitts and Nevis is the smallest country in North America as it only covers 261 km² (101 mi²).

**Map of North America** 

North America has many rivers. These include The Mississippi, Ohio, Rio Grande, Colorado, Hudson rivers. However, The Missouri River is the longest river on the continent. The Missouri flows for around 3,767 km in the US.

  

[North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) has plains, forests, deserts, lakes, mountains and even volcanoes. The Rocky Mountains are the longest mountain range in the continent. It stretches through two countries, Canada and USA. However, the highest peak in the continent lies in The Alaska Mountains. It's called Mount Denali which reaches a height of 20,310 ft (6190 m) above sea level.

  

**Meet the people** 

More than 364 million people live in North America. The United States is the most inhabited nation in North America with more than 329.5 million people living there. Saint Kitts and Nevis is the least inhabited country on the continent with only around 50.000 people living there! Mexico City, Mexico is the most populated city in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) with more than 9 million people living in it.

 

North America is a VERY diverse continent. Millions of people immigrated to the continent over the years making the area a pot of cultures. This wide range of cultures affected all parts of life from music to food. Many types of music were born in North America. These include Blues and Jazz in the US, and the Mariachi and Ranchera in Mexico. 

 

Food plays a big part in the lives of people in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/). Canadians love to eat Poutine, Bannock and butter tarts. The Mexican cuisine is famous for its spices. Chilaquiles, empanadas and fajitas make the mouths of many Mexicans water. The US is considered by many to be the founder of Fast Industry. Many Fast food brands were born in the US, such as KFC, McDonald's and Pizza Hut. 

 

People in North America also love their sports. It's almost impossible to turn on your TV and not find a match to watch. American football is the most popular sport in the US. The super bowl is the biggest game of this sport. It's usually the most-watched event on TV. The fun doesn't stop here. American football is popular in America. But the NBA is huge all over the WORLD. It's the most-watched basketball league. People from all around wake up early or stay up late just to see the magic of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, James Harden and other hoops stars.

 

Away from The US, Mexicans are CRAZY about soccer. Thousands of Fans gather in stadiums to support their local clubs and, of course, the national team. The Mexican men's soccer team won the most titles of The CONCACAF Gold Cup (11 titles). In Canada, Ice hockey is the most popular team in the country. The Canada men's national ice hockey team won 9 gold medals in the winter Olympics and the women won 4!

  

Speaking about the Olympics, The United States has been the most successful nation on that huge world stage winning more than 2,600 medals. Not only that! America is also home to the most successful Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps. The legendary swimmer won 28 medals, including 23 gold ones. The US has also hosted the Olympics eight times, that's more than any other country in the world! In 2028, the Summer Olympics will return to The US, as the event will be held in Los Angeles! Canada and Mexico have also hosted the Summer Olympics, Canada in 1976 and Mexico in 1968. 

 

North America is also known for Tech companies. Many major companies saw the light on its soil. They include Apple, Facebook, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and Tesla. Silicon Valley in California is home to tons of major companies and start-ups. The technological rush started early in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/). The continent has always been a haven for scientists and inventors. Thomas Alva Edison was one of America's greatest inventors. The US was also the first country to send a man to the moon. That happened on July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked here. 

 

People in North America celebrate many holidays. Halloween is very popular in The US, especially with children who enjoy Trick-or-treating. This spooky holiday is celebrated on the night of October 31. A similar day is marked in Mexico. Día de Muertos (English: Day of The Dead) is celebrated in the southern country. Other popular holidays in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) include Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

North America is a beautiful land of beaches, forests, deserts, lakes, waterfalls, mountains and everything in between. Here are our picks of North America's many hidden gems.

 

**Big Bend National Park, USA**

If you head west in the American state of Texas, you will find this mesmerizing 801,163 -acre- park. Big bend was officially a national park on June 12, 1944. It's home to many species of plants, mammals, reptiles and birds. The park took its name from its location. As it lies on a big bend in the Rio Grande River. Some people enjoy hiking, biking or fishing in the area. While adventure seekers love taking river trips or riding horses there.

 

**Spotted Lake, Canada**

Some people call the spotted lake ""the most magical place in Canada"". To enjoy the beauty of this lake located in Osoyoos, Canada, you have to visit it in the summer. During this season, the water of the lake evaporates leaving behind yellow, green and blue spots. The spots are collections of minerals and salt that run off the surrounding hills. In the past, indigenous groups believed that each spot has different healing powers. Nowadays, people can't touch the water of the lake but can still enjoy its fascinating view. 



**Man-Made Wonders** 

People in [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) have built wonders over the years. Here are some man-made sites you should consider visiting.

 

**Hollywood’s World of Illusions, The US**   
   
 

Los Angeles, California has one the coolest place on earth; the museum has 4 breathtaking experiences that will set your imaginative mind free. 

Spiderman isn’t the only one who can walk on walls or hang from the ceiling, get ready to defy gravity and have your world turned upside down in “The Upside Down House”. 

 

Your next stop would be the museum of illusions with all the 3D artwork that will blow your mind and your Instagram profile. You can also visit the Giant’s house see the world with a super extra-large magnifying glass with over 31 mega items that will make you feel so tiny. 

 

Stressed? Not anymore with the “Smash It!” room where you can blow off some steam; just write down what’s stressing you out on a plate and throw it against the wall as hard as you can. The ""Smash It"" room is restricted to +12 years old only. 

 

  
 **Chichen Itza, Mexico**

Before the European's arrival to [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/), Chichen Itza was the most vibrant city in the Yucatan Peninsula, which later became a part of Mexico. Chichen Itza shows the great civilization of the Mayans. Till now, people come from all over the world to see the remains of the Mayan people including the El Castillo pyramid. The famous pyramid is the crown jewel of the site. In the past, the structure was used as a temple. It has 4 staircases that all lead to the top.

  

**Take a bite** 

Between Two North American countries, a flavorsome meal was born. Fajita is one of the most popular meals in Mexico and [North America](https://globitopia.com/north-america-facts/) in general. It was created in the 1930s by Mexican workers in Texas. Back then, some workers were paid with meat, so the workers used their *salary* to make this famed meal. 

Nowadays, fajitas are made in many ways. One of these ways is to grill strips of steak with opinions and peppers. It's served hot with tortillas, sour cream and salsa. Some people use chicken to make fajitas. And if you are a vegetarian, don't worry! You can still make delicious fajitas with just vegetables.

TravelHacks,"Hi there,

I booked a flight 3 weeks ago with travel agent A from London to Lahore. Paid £2500 per person, which I felt was extortionate at the time.

I am seeing the same flight, same dates, same times, same carrier today at £1100 per person at travel agent B.

Should I cancel my tickets with A and rebook them with B? Is this doable? What are my risks here?

I think since 2/3 weeks ago Omicron has changed the travel situation. Pakistan is not on the red list, and its not that much harder to get in/out of Pakistan/UK, so I don't understand why the massive price drop.

What should I do? Your advice will be appreciated.","I am seeing a flight at 50% of the price compared to 3 weeks ago, should I cancel original flight and rebook the cheaper option?",,TenakhaKhan,,6,2021-12-15 13:03:28

TravelHacks,"Hi there,

We want to take a little vacation over the holidays and go somewhere warm in the States. While we want to fly into a big city, we're hoping to pick somewhere with lots of good nature/hiking spots. However, we won't be renting a car so we'd be reliant on public transport. (Not interested in uber-ing more than to/from the airport to keep costs down.) Would be up for biking and walking a lot, too!

Which of these places has the best combination of nature &amp; decent public transportation?

TravelHacks," I have made the decision to spend the majority of 2022 travelling, specifically I want to travel around Asia for roughly a couple of months (Vietnam, Thailand, Bali) and then finish my trip off by finding work in Australia and spending a fairly long period of time living there (minimum of roughly 6 months).

I am a 19 year old woman, and have no previous experience of travelling alone so the thought of it is both very exciting yet daunting to me, hence the thought of going through a company where I will be travelling with like minded people similar in age to myself. I have found that REALGAP have the exact kind of thing I want to do, but a lot of people urge against REALGAP saying it's basically a scam, and many people urge against going with a company altogether and say it's best to organise it all yourself. The 'better' companies only offer short trips and are much more expensive, so i'm having a hard time trying to decide what option is best for me.

Has anyone ever gone with any of these companies before/ is going with, and does anyone have any suggestions on the best thing for me to do?

TravelHacks,"
I’m a 35 year old female who travels several times a year with my travel buddy, my sister. We’ve traveled extensively to and from Europe, and we’re no strangers to long-haul flights (hello, Istanbul to Atlanta 12h20m) but one thing is certain, we always feel like absolute trash when we land. Itchy skin, burning eyes, thirsty but nothing quenches, bad taste in our mouths, weird sweaty crotch feeling (and general uncleanliness feeling), hungry but not hungry, and just generally miserable. We end up getting to our dwellings and eventually collapse even if it’s 1pm and wake up the next day after sleeping like 15 hours. My sister and I are both big time sleepers. I’m not proud to admit it, but I slept so late on my day off last week that I missed daylight. We’re SLEEPERS. Anytime. Any place. We can NEVER get a restful sleep on an airplane. We can be tired AF and doze here and there, but never more than collectively an hour or so on every 8-10 hour flight we take. For me, I don’t think the problem is being tired, it’s RELAXING. The vibrations of the plane and overall excitement just prevent it. I’ve tried knocking myself out with Benadryl or Dramamine… same thing. In and out of sleep, nothing restful. I was thinking this time I should bring in the big guns. Maybe take some Xanax after I board because it will help me relax to hopefully sleep. Thoughts?  I feel like I should mention that we’re small people and also don’t have issues getting comfortable. We also have bought several accessories over the years (foot hammock, various neck pillows, the pillow you blow up and put your head and hands in, etc). OR does anyone have any tips to avoid the above mentioned misery when we land?  We have our annual upcoming trip to Venice in February and I really, really want to find a solution.",Flying misery,,margaretasmith,,37,2021-12-10 07:15:43

This past New Year, my girlfriend and I broke our apartment lease and took off on a 6-month road trip to stay at Airbnbs around the US. We spent a month staying in places like Lake Tahoe, San Diego, and Honolulu.

We had an incredible trip, but finding an Airbnb with fast, reliable Wifi and comfortable workspaces was time-consuming and difficult.

So, I decided to build a free Chrome Extension called Offie to make it easier to find the best Airbnbs for remote work.

Offie works seamlessly with Airbnb by taking Wifi and workspace information from the listing page and bringing it to the search page. No more wasting time looking through photos and getting excited about a listing, only to realize the Wifi is slow!

Current Offie features include the following information from a listing:

* 📶 Wifi speed test results
* 🖥️ Dedicated workspace amenities
* ✅ Sentiment analysis on reviews mentioning Wifi

[Offie is available to download for free from the Chrome store today.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offie-airbnb-wifi-reviews/hhookjglfpdjgdmgdaippnmgciafbfbd)

Would love to get feedback on other useful features, and I'm happy to answer any questions!

I was hoping to backpack through the Balkans in Feb. Namely Croatia and Serbia. Has anyone here been there recently and can tell me more about how open the countries are?

I hope to do all the normal backpacking things like clubs and museums etc but am not sure how possible that is.

I have the american pfizer vax but am also not sure how easy it is to turn that into the EU QR code.

Any help would be very appreciated!",Travel to Croatia/Serbia during Covid,,Totallygassed,,6,2021-12-01 14:33:50

TravelHacks,"So I work with four dudes from Mexico who come to Michigan and help on the orchard for 8 months. I've been friends with them for a few years now and even visited them last winter in the off season (Oaxaca is amazing if you've never been).

They asked me to help them get home and I've gotten plane tickets handled, but I want to know if there is a better way to ship luggage than taking it on a plane? They all have a carry on and personal item, but a couple have big bags they want to take, but it'll cost them a lot to carry so much. 

I wonder if anyone has any answers. I always travel cheap, so trying to ship bags from Detroit to Mexico City is new to me.

TravelHacks,"Just got home from a trip to Madrid and thought I’d detail the process with all of the covid rules since I couldn’t find any information specific to flying with Iberia before going on the trip.

There are four things you’ll need to travel to the US from Spain:
1. Passport 
2. Vaccination Card
3. Negative Covid Test (within 72 hours of arrival in the U.S. 
4. U.S. Attestation form

Covid Test: 
I scheduled the 25€ Rapid Antigen test at the Madrid airport 2 hours before my flight. The testing center at the Madrid airport is outside of security on the backside of the McDonald’s. I had an appointment and was able to get my test an hour before my appointed time. The line went very fast and I had my results within 10 minutes. There is also a line if you do not have an appointment and I imagine you would be able to get in fairly quickly. This did disallow me to enter my documents through Iberia’s online portal as I did not have my test before I got to the airport and couldn’t properly fill out my attestation. To get my boarding pass I just had to show my negative covid test, vaccine card and passport.

Attestation:
This was confusing for me at first because I was emailed the document from Iberia 24 hours before my flight. I wasn’t sure if I could e-sign or if it would need to be printed. I also couldn’t fill it out until I got to the airport to get my covid test. When I got to the airport, there were iberia signs with a QR code to open a questionnaire that had the same questions as the document. When done, it filled out the attestation form for you to show to the gate agent. I did not have to show this form at the check in desk pre security but had to show it to get through to the “U.S. bound” gate area inside the terminal. 

Hopefully this helps someone out! It sounds like the take home tests/testing in a clinic outside the airport may be better options if you want to streamline everything and upload your documents before you get to the airport. Though, testing at the airport ended up being very easy.",MAD-LAX Iberia/AA Information,,cortanamontana,,3,2021-11-28 20:10:59

TravelHacks,"I leave the US Dec 3rd and go to Rome then catch a connecting flight to Switzerland. Planning on staying there for 5 days then spending the rest of time in Italy. 

With the announcement of the new variant in Italy I’m not too sure what to do. I’m not too worried about catching it, just worried about potential lock downs and what that might mean for my trip. 

I can cancel now and get most of my money back (some airbnbs I will lose money on and some train tickets) but I would be really upset if nothing happened lockdown wise with the variant and I cancelled. 

One thought I had was to cancel the Italy portion of the trip and just stay in Switzerland since there are no reported cases and I’m pretty confident that Switzerland won’t go into another lockdown.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone, so I’m in a bit of a weird situation and I need some advice, I don’t know if this is the place to ask but I am desperate.

A few months ago I have booked a trip to Vienna for early December, but obviously it has to be canceled because of the lockdown. I ,fortunately, was able to get a refund on my accommodation, but I have made the not-so-smart decision of purchasing plane tickets with Ryanair.


Now, I have tried speaking to them about postponing the tickets to later since I literally won’t be able to get into Austria, getting a refund (since it’s not my fault I won’t be able to fly there), everything you can think of. They won’t have it. 

Told them I purchased their Plus Insurance and they told me to e-mail their insurance team and I did, almost 2 weeks ago, 2 times. NO ANSWER.

I am literally at my wit’s end with them, and tbh I would’ve left it alone if it was a 30€ flight, but I payed 4 times the price, don’t even get me started on this mistake. And right now, it’s not really money I can afford to lose.

I am trying to graduate from domestic travel to international travel hacking now. I am still trying to wrap my head around transferring UR to various airlines still, but could use some general guidance until I figure those details out. I am trying to plan a trip for two to Japan from the US (LAX, SFO, or SEA) in the fall of 2023. What kind of UR point balance should I have to safely ensure we can pay for two RT ANA business class tickets with points when it comes time? 

We are currently at 261k UR points, and based on what I see on awardhacker it seems like 261k would be plenty assuming 1:1 conversion ratio. Is this a safe assumption for now or should I budget for more? It's fine if I over estimate points needed to a degree, but I would like to avoid under estimating. Trying to strategize where I apply some quickly upcoming expenses and slacked on researching this earlier...

TravelHacks,"
Hi all! I'll be traveling to Italy next year and can't find definitive info on covid testing requirements so I'm getting anxious and figured someone here may have experience.

I see on the italy embassy website that it now says if you are from the US and fully vaccinated, that you need a covid test (rapid antigen or PCR) taken 72 hours before arrival.

My worry is thst PCR results take longer than 72 hrs to get back in most places or cost a lot so I was planning on doing a rapid antigen test at CVS. So my questions are

Has anyone gotten the rapid antigen test and had the results accepted? And what did you take as proof...just the print out of results?

Also, if I'm landing in Italy at 9AM, does that mean I need to take the test within 72 hours of the 9AM italy time, or does it suffice to take it within 72 hrs of my first leg departing time?

Im a car guy, so I always like to try and rent something interesting.  My ideal scenario would be renting an alfa romeo or a fiat spyder for the trip, but havjng trouble finding rental places where i can pick a specific model that are not crazy pricey and renting Ferraris.

Looks like two somewhat achievable options are a Fiat 500 cabriolet, or an Alfa Romeo Giulietta hatchback.  The fiat would be interesting if it can fit our luggage.  The alfa is cool as that model is not sold in the states, but at the end of the day its essentially like a mazda 3 hatch by the look of it.  I also want to get a manual transmission.

TravelHacks,"I'm a 27 year old traveler, and am visited Turkey a week back. I live in New York. I am extremely organized (sometimes OCD even) with all my travel plans and documents. Before my visit, I researched the need for a visa, and turns out I could get one on arrival. I thought that seemed like an easy option. 
And I was wrong...when I went to the check-in counter for Turkish Airlines (New York - Istanbul), the lady asked me for my visa. I informed her that I plan to get one on arrival. She initially didn't agree but upon showing her some online links, she obliged. Turkish airlines made me sign a letter stating that I am responsible for my travel entry paperwork and that should anything go wrong, I will be bearing the cost of a return flight back. At this time, I didn't know I could get the visa online btw. I had no option but to sign that. Apparently, airlines are liable to bring you back if you don't possess valid documentation (interesting discussion by itself). 
Anyway, I made it to my flight which went well.
Upon reaching Istanbul, I saw 2 lines - one if you've a visa and the other if you don't. After about 45 mins, I reached the counter where I requested for a visa. The guy asked for $80 in cash (USD). At airport, I had already converted my cash to Turkish Lira and only had my card. Shockingly, they wouldn't accept their own currency. Since people behind me were understandably getting frustrated, I was asked to buy a visa online. 
Wow - I didn't know this was possible and I did have my T-mobile data working. So I went on the official website to buy the visa. The process was v simple and I was approved instantly (not sure if everyone is). However, the story doesn't end here...
My payment card would not work. I tried 7 times or so. I asked the guy who simply told me to email the authorities. I emailed but obviously I wasn't going to get a reply immediately. I went through a lot of reddit and TripAdvisor forums complaining of the same but not a single solution. I tried buying it on chrome &amp; Firefox on my laptop but couldn't. it just didn't accept my card. I tried creating a WePay account but as an American, I wasn't able to. So what did I do?
As I was finding ways, I went on Upwork and looked for people with WePay. My offer was simple: I'll pay you 20% more if you pay for the visa using your WePay account. Unfortunately, everyone I matched with thought I was scamming them. One person obliged but he'd do it after 7 days when upwork sends money to his account. 7 days! Then, I came across an iPhone app called atlys where I could apply for the visa, pay using Apple Pay and (advertised) get it instantly. As someone who is obsessed with research, I'd check it out across the internet before committing to using it but nervousness got the better of me.  But luckily, that worked phew. I got my visa with my bar code. I've been to 31 countries and as an American passport holder, this was definitely the strangest experience. 

P.S. another cheaper hack is to get a service that provides virtual cards. I suggested that to my gf and the 5th or so virtual card worked voila! just note that those services can be shady/hard to find. I literally used stripe api to create my own virtual cards (I am a creator and use strip).",How I almost got kicked out of Turkey and saved myself,,shashank_g09,,6,2021-11-16 02:40:33

This will be the last leg of a trip with family and friends, but no one that I'm with wants to go to the race (tickets are rather expensive and no one else is a fan). On top of that, due to some of the social distancing measures they have in place, the race organizer has a rule where you need to buy a minimum of two tickets. The way I see it, I have three choices

1. Buy two tickets and still go alone
2. Find someone else in the same situation and buy tickets with them
3. Buy two tickets and try to resell the second (from what I've read, this could be really difficult)

 *― Erin Hanson*

Brazil is a favorite destination for many tourists. The South American giant is one of the most visited nations on earth. [Brazil](https://globitopia.com/brazil-facts/) is famous for its beaches, music and football. Every year, people gather to celebrate the declaration of the republic on the 15th of November. This day is a constant reminder of how Brazil overcame slavery and injustice. Keep reading to learn more about Brazil’s Republic Day

&amp;#x200B;

**A look In the History Book**

Brazil was declared an empire in 1822 under military commandment by Brazil's first emperor “Don Pedro I”. This man freed [Brazil](https://globitopia.com/brazil-facts/) from the Portuguese colonization that lasted from 1500 to 1815. 

But in 1831, his five-year-old son “Don Pedro II” took over the empire. The years of “Don Pedro II” weren’t that kind for poor people in [Brazil](https://globitopia.com/brazil-facts/). As Brazil suffered from slavery. The upper classes argued that slavery was essential to the foundation of the Empire and its success. 

**Fall of the Empire and Rise of the Republic** 

Over the years the Empire had the upper hand in quieting the revolutions against him. In 1889, Marshal “Deodoro da Fonseca” -who was a popular hero among [Brazil’s](https://globitopia.com/brazil-facts/) citizens and soldiers- overthrew “Dom Pedro II” and his daughter Princess “Isabel” -the rightful heir to the empire- by a bloodless military coup on November the 15th, freeing his people, providing equal opportunities for all citizens and establishing the federal republic.  
 **Current Times** 

Brazilians consider November the 15th a glorious day in the history of Brazil. They believe that the day Brazil became a republic is a day of victory to justice, equality and human rights. The 15th of November is an official holiday in [Brazil](https://globitopia.com/brazil-facts/). It’s a day off for the people, schools, businesses and public services.

The streets get flooded by festive parades and proud people all dressed up in the yellow-green famous Brazilian colors. You can’t un-see the national flag flying in all the streets, flapping to the beats of the drums while the people are chanting and dancing to songs of liberty. 

Men of power and public figures have their fair share of public appearances and speeches that reassure the people about the continued advancement of equal employment opportunity and equality in general. 

**Everything “Republic”!**

Brazil had always glorified being a republic. After the proclamation of the republic in 1889, “Effigy of the republic” -which was a Roman lady wearing a bay leaves tiara symbolizing republic- became an important symbol of the newly formed republic of [Brazil](https://globitopia.com/brazil-facts/). Effigy also appears on the “real”. The ""real"" is the official currency in Brazil.",Brazil’s Republic Day,,Globitopia,,0,2021-11-14 21:02:09

TravelHacks,"I am new to churning and credit card points. I have 210K UR points (my wife has 130K on her CSP), and essentially want to use it towards our Honeymoon to Maui, Hawaii (January 2022).

&amp;#x200B;

We are thinking of going 12/31 thru 1/9 or 1/14 thru 1/23. Our dates are flexible. 

I have been doing research, and have some specific questions to clarify how transferring to other partners works:

1. I created a World of Hyatt account, and I have a CSP. Is that all I need to transfer my points to Hyatt? So if Hyatt advertises a hotel for 30K points a night, I transfer 30K UR points over and it's a done deal?
2. Are there any hidden fees that creep up when you book a Hyatt using points? Any automatic perks?
3. Regarding points valuation: The way I understand it, on UR, each point is worth 1.25 cents. However, if Hyatt advertises a $1,700 a night hotel for 30,000 points a night, that's 5.66 cents per point? Is $1,700/30K a good deal? What's the cutoff for a ""good deal""?
4. I am considering applying for one of the Hyatt credit cards, to boost our points even further, and to establish a relationship with Hyatt. I am personally a fan of Hyatt, and it would be nice to get perks when I stay there. Can you recommend me a good card to use in conjunction with UR?

I also have some specific questions regarding booking flights through points if you don't mind:

1. What's the best way to use UR points to fly for free? Is it through the UR interface, or through other sources?
2. If the goal is to transfer our UR points to other partners, do we need to open lines of credit with those partners, or is it simply the frequent flyer types of programs?

Still, I cannot afford to get stuck there. I understand the protocol is that once you arrive, if you immediately take a test and it is negative the results are good for 3 days and so if I depart Friday morning, I should be safe. Is that accurate? What kind of test do they require you to take, can I show them a rapid test I took myself or does it have to be a dated PCR test result from an official clinic?

TravelHacks,"Just finishing out planning for next year's trade show season.  I'll be on the road 106 nights, driving all around the country to mostly metropolitan areas.  This will likely be the same schedule for 2023 (100+ nights). I'm trying to figure out how to maximize my spend, here are some assumptions;

106 nights

Hotel/Airbnb average cost $175/night (many of the nights there will be one or two other people with me)

As I am driving a truck and trailer, I am considering getting a ""toy hauler"" style travel trailer that has living quarters in the front and storage space for the event materials in the back, like a reverse mullet.  If I assume 200+ nights over 2 years, at $175 night for lodging, that is $35,000.  I can maximize that amount with some cash back on a credit card, and earn some free nights with a hotel loyalty program if it is with a hotel chain, though Airbnb will be cheaper when I have several adults and need different rooms.  If I go with a toy hauler trailer, I would need to purchase one, which would cost in the realm of $60-70K.  In theory there will be some resell value at the end of two years, maybe $20K.  The difference in fuel economy will be negligible between my current trailer setup, and a toy hauler setup (IE it is a sunk cost either way).  

I am stuck in the paralysis of analysis phase.  I'd like to buy a nice toy hauler, it is convenient and allows me to sleep whenever and wherever is needed.  That said, there is maintenance, interest, and the encumbrance of hauling a 40' trailer around the country.  The hotel route is always available, though the hotels are not always convenient to the venue, and the entire cost of the hotel room feels like a sunk cost (no resell value).

They seem to soak up sweat under my arms and changing undershirts out allows me to feel fresh and keep wearing my outer garments for days without them getting gross.

One downside is obviously that the pit area stains from deodorant that includes silver.  After about 6 months, I typically replace my undershirts or just use them for workouts.

Am I correct that my deodorant would probably stain wool undershirts the same way?  If the staining has anything to do with absorbing sweat, would wool’s wicking properties keep it from staining?

TravelHacks,"Hello friends! 
I’ve had a couple of Wanna Get Away tickets booked on Southwest for a few months. My partner and I have recently decided that we would rather drive to our destination. Unfortunately, the Wanna Get Away fares are non-refundable. The airline will only issue credit to use on future flights.
Southwest does have two other categories of flights that are refundable upon cancellation. 
I’m thinking of rescheduling a flight using the credits from the cancelled flight to book a refundable flight and getting my money back.

Has anyone else done this? Any other tips??

TravelHacks,"Hey travel dwellers!

Perhaps it's the best place to ask the question that I've been wondering about for a long time. I certainly enjoy traveling but for the most part, exploring &amp; discovering local experiences but not the ones from the postcard covers. But I found it fairly challenging to find them as they're hidden all over the internet and experienced travelers are not keen to share them, or in youtube videos/IG posts they never mention exact locations and descriptions about why that certain experience is unique.

So, with all that disappointment, friends and I decided to work on a side project which will (hopefully) accumulate all hidden gems of our beautiful planet into one place and every user will have their travel passport (i.e. profile) where they can track visited spots/cities/countries and share them with friends.

With all that being said, if you do know a great spot that everyone should visit or experience that we all should live through, please share, or if you have any ideas/suggestions/feedback, please share (:

I'd like to travel internationally, for a few months, to one specific locale, and embed myself in a culture to study it from an academic perspective. When I say ""culture"", I do not mean, for example, the culture of downtown Manhattan. I mean, instead, and strictly as an example, a small tribe of Ainu in northern Japan.

I am not an academic. I am not a credentialed anthropologist or anything of the like. I am, simply, interested in studying different cultures intimately and for an extended period of time.

My questions are, aside from being numerous, I think, basic:

1. Are there examples of this sort of travel and study being done in the modern era?
2. How do I procure a translator?
3. How do I procure access to reclusive communities?

Generally, at least three months must supposedly be left on your UK passport to visit Europe from the UK.

I realised I had a lot of leave to take before the year's up, so decided taking the Eurostar to visit my brother on the continent would be a good idea. All was sounding good, but it occurred to me that my passport was issued in July 2011 and will expire in Nov 2011.

Has anyone given entering the mainland from the UK a go with a passport on its final weeks? Will there be a way for me to visit him next week with this passport? Would applying for a new passport before setting off give me more grace on the current passport?

Did a search and nothing came up for ""UK passport"". Yes, I know it's a fairly messy question. It's borne out of trying to get over avoidant habits developed during the pandemic, and there's been another mental hurdle in the affordability of ever seeing him, and having squirrelled away my leave days in hope that we'd be seeing considerably less than 30–40k new Covid cases a day here on Plague Island.

I'm not sure what to make of this, but when I found out that United had a hub in SFO, I immediately thought, I should get a United co-branded credit card.  Now I'm not so sure. Maybe I should get a Delta card?  I want to travel internationally and Delta and American have no int'l flights out of SFO.  If you have any experience with a similar situation, please share.

TravelHacks,"Looking to go from ATL to DUB in late January into February. Trying to determine if I should pay cash or use points/miles.

* Option 1- Cash purchase via Delta, most likely or AF of KLM, cost will be about $725
   * Option 1a - Redeem Skymiles for essentially the same cost
* Option 2 - Transfer Chase points to Virgin Atlantic, 24000 points + $387, total cash value is like $690
* Option 3 - Transfer Chase points to BA for Flying Blue, but I don't know the cost because I am not a member so therefore can't search using points
   * If anyone wants to check for me, the dates are 1/26/22 to 2/1/22

There doesn't seem to be a big gap in cash value of points vs pay actual dollars, so I don't see the benefit of using the points and would probably be better served for when an actual deal comes along. Thoughts?",Pay cash or use miles to get to Dublin?,,Mindspin_311,,0,2021-10-12 17:47:42

TravelHacks,"Hello! Curious if any in the community have had recent experience with UTOvacation out of Toronto. My wife found this deal on travelzoo: https://www.utovacation.com/Ancient-Greece-8-Days-USA-Departure

In short, is this company legit? I'm extremely wary of handing over passport information, although I understand this is needed for booking international flights. 

Reasons for red flags:
1. Passport info over the internet is a bad idea usually!
2. Nonstandard pricing structure (300/person upfront, 300/person 2 weeks after booking, then a final payment a month out)
3. They claim their strength is reducing overhead by being online only

Most of the reviews are based on their China packages and the complaints are all based on COVID cancellations last year. They have TICO and BBB registrations and have for several years, but my spidey sense is tingling. Am I just paranoid?

TravelHacks,"1) Always make sure to look over the listing page carefully first, before booking.  This means making sure you understand the cancellation policy, making sure you understand what kind of listing you're getting (room or a whole place), and how presentable it looks.  You can always message the host to ask questions before committing to a rental.  It's always better to find out if there's a deal-breaker BEFORE you rent.

&amp;#x200B;

2) The grace period for getting a full refund depends on TWO things:  How soon after booking are you cancelling, and how soon is the check in date.  You don't get a grace period if there's a ""strict"" cancellation policy and the check in is less than a week away.  Again, make sure you understand these things before committing.

&amp;#x200B;

3) You're not supposed to book reservations on your account, if you're not one of the people staying there (i.e. booking for an elderly parent or a child).  This is a safety issue for the host, so they know who's staying there.  (The only exceptions are business stays).  The host can waive this, if they choose, but don't count on the host doing this.  If you want to set up a stay for someone else, it's better to help them create their own account, with their own ID, and you can let them use your card to pay for it (or buy them a gift card, if you can).

&amp;#x200B;

4) If you decide to cancel a reservation at one place and instead book another place for overlapping dates, make sure to cancel the old trip FIRST before booking the new one.   Otherwise, your service fee (the part that goes to Airbnb) won't be refunded, even if you were eligible.  The reason is that overlapping reservations aren't allowed (because you won't be one of the people staying at one of the listings.  See #3 again).  If you have, say, a large group, and need to book a couple of places at once, it's better for one of the people staying at the other place to book it themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

5) I recommend checking reviews and trying to book with a Superhost, if possible.  Superhosts are hosts who consistently get good ratings (an average of 4.8 stars out of 5, or better) and have a host cancellation rate of 1% or less.  They also respond to inquiries within 24 hours, even if it's just to say a place is not available.

&amp;#x200B;

6) If you're still not sure about something, you can call Airbnb directly.  Again, it's almost always easier to solve problems before you book.",Airbnb advice from a former Airbnb customer service agent,,n_mcrae_1982,,29,2021-10-10 18:46:57

I want to make a phone call to Expedia to ask about cancellation, but before I do that, I'm seeing that it might not be that easy. It looks like they need a reason for cancelling and only SOME reasons are covered; ie. family emergencies, illness, legal obligation etc. I don't think they'll take ""sorry can't afford it"" as a valid reason.

My question is- How should I go about canceling? Should I lie and say it's for a family emergency? Will they require documentation or proof?

I'm doing a family thing in December, and I'm looking at booking a multi-city itinerary WAS --&gt; ORL --&gt; DFW --&gt; WAS. 

Here's the thing: I'm very large (as in I need a seat belt extender for those last 3-4 inches), and I need to take that into consideration when selecting an airline. Generally, I try to select flights with 18"" wide seats, but I can do 17"" if I'm on the aisle, and the armrests go up. I also am going to need to check a bag. Money isn't a huge issue, but I also don't love the idea of spending \~$1400 on first class. 

So, looking at a multi-city fare on Kayak, it looks like Spirit Airlines is the cheapest at around $300. SeatGuru says the seats are 17.75"" wide, which is acceptable. I don't \*think\* seat pitch will be an issue as I'm only 5'11"". I have a rule not to fly Spirit based on a bad experience in 2005, but I'm considering breaking my rule. Should I do it?

I’m trying to fly home for an extended period of time. Due to the length of my stay, I’m going to bring my pet onboard. She’s a bit small, but roughly 30lbs dog.

Does anyone have experience traveling with a “oversized” pet? Anything i should consider, or prepare for? I really want to bring her in the cabin, but that looks impossible. If it changes anything the flight will be direct.

I wanted to ask, is there a way to get the emergency row without paying exuberant amounts of money for seat selection?

My boyfriend is 6’9”, and would really appreciate flying with the emergency row.

From  US East coast to West coast.

Is there a procedure to get it because of this or do we need to shell out the money?

Edit:
Thank you for the advice! I’ll try to call the airline and be polite and practically beg haha.

If not, will shell out the cash for him. Thank you for the advice! I wanted to ask before I bought the tickets in general!

It might not have the proper continent form that you have in mind. It might have countries that you have never heard of before. If you’re only thinking of [Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)on hearing the word “[Oceania](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)”, then you’re simply missing out a lot of outstanding island nations and cultures. Keep reading to learn more about Oceania facts and secrets.

***Pin on the Map***

Oceanian islands extend over 100 million square kilometers in the central and south Pacific region but the actual land surface area is about 8.5 million square kilometers making it the world's smallest continent by land area.

Oceanian islands are located in the Southern Hemisphere with 14 countries and 14 territories. [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) is the biggest land in [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)and the 6th largest country in the world. Nauru is the smallest country in Oceania but the Pitcairn is the smallest land in the region. It is a British overseas territory.

***On The Land***

The islands of Oceania are divided into four sub-regions; Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.

But the way the islands were formed divided [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)into three different groups; *Continental islands* that were once part of a continent but sea-level changes and tectonic movement separated them, such as [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/). *High/Volcanic islands* that are formed by underwater volcanic eruptions after cooling and hardening by the ocean, such as Fiji and American Samoa.

*Low/Coral islands* are made of corals -the skeletons of marine mammals- such as Willis Island.

Oceania is known for being a limited agricultural land with no deep-rooted river systems like the Nile or the Amazon. The longest river in [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)is the Murray River which runs for around 1,558 miles.

Oceania has one of the most spectacular natural ecosystems on Earth. The Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that expands for 2.600 Km in The Coral Sea from the coast of Queensland in [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/).

It’s the biggest coral reef system in the world. It contains over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands.

Swimming, scuba diving, snorkelling, semi-subs tours and glass-bottom boat rides all seem like ordinary activities anywhere but here. You will be swimming next to six of the world's seven species of marine turtle and 10% of the world’s total fish species in addition to some of the rarest marine species like the dugong -known as elephant of the sea-, the potato grouper, Great hammerhead sharks, Manta Rays and Nemo ... Oh sorry! We meant the clownfish.

In addition to the outstanding marine life in [Oceania](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/), this continent is known for its exceptional wildlife; especially marsupials that carry the offspring in the pouch such as kangaroos, wombat and koalas.

The national animals there are unique, rare and endemic. These include the kiwi, the emu and the dugong. Poisonous species, such as the brown snake, tiger snake, [Sydney ](https://globitopia.com/sydney-the-finest-harbor-in-the-world/)funnel-web spider, red-back spider and jack jumper ants might be a problem there as its widespread is quite anxious. However, people of Oceania are educated about native wildlife and potential dangers, so they always manage to keep a safe distance and live in peace with the animals. Wildlife attacks in [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)happen rarely.

Oceania has a few breathtaking mountain ranges which include the Great Dividing Range, The Blue Mountains and the Australian Alps in [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/), Kaikoura Ranges and the Southern Alps in New Zealand, Owen Stanley Range and Bismarck Range in Papua New Guinea.

Mount Wilhelm in the Bismarck range is one of the highest mountains in [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)which is 4,509 m high. Most of the Oceanian mountains are volcanic ones, such as Mount Tomanivi in Fiji, Mount Lamington in Papua New Guinea, Mount Yasur in Vanuatu and the North Island volcanic plateau in New Zealand.

Deserts in [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)are located in [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) and New Zealand as the rest of Oceania is mainly composed of small islands.

The central Australian desert is the most famous due to the huge 863 m red rock of Uluru in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. Uluru is an iconic attraction in [Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)that was once sacred by the indigenous people.

The Oceanian Islands are tropical ones with the sun, sea, tropical breeze and tropical rain such as Bora Bora and Tahiti.

The Oceanian lands are paradises on earth, yet they have the highest diversity and frequency of all types of natural disasters known to man such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires, landslides and drought.

Australia’s deadliest disaster was the Cyclone Mahina in 1899 in Queensland with an unknown number of deaths.  


***Meet the People***

Oceania is the 2nd least populous continent in the world after Antarctica with only 43 million inhabitants living there. [Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)is the most crowded country with around 25 million people. Nauru is the least populated country in [Oceania](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/), and the 3rd least-populous country in the world, with less than 11 thousand people.

There are thousands of languages spoken in [Oceania](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/). The Papuan languages -about 850 different types- are the most widely spoken native languages with about 4 million speakers in different countries like Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and neighboring countries.

[Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)has a high lingual and cultural diversity as a result of immigration. Aside from English, Australians speak more than 300 languages, such as Mandarin, Italian, Greek and Arabic.  


This down under land is home to the world's most diverse range of indigenous cultures that started thousands of years ago with Oceanian ancestors coming from the southeast of Asia and expanding into further remote islands.

The Lapita was an early culture with influential arts that started between 1500 BCE and 500 BCE. They are believed to be the ancestors of the modern-day cultures of Polynesia and Micronesia with their ceramic sculptures and pottery found in Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia.

The first European explorers reached [Oceania ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)by 1500. All the previous artistic and architectural traditions continued, along with the emerging new cultures that were quite similar to the western ones.

The size of both the territory and population with the availability of natural resources and minerals made [Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)and New Zealand the richest two Countries in [Oceania](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/). Unlike the Kiribati island which is the poorest country in Oceania that lacks skilled workers and has a remote scattered location so there’s almost no tourism income.

Oceanian people have mastered unique and unusual sports, such as netball, rugby, cricket and Australian Rules football. They have even set many organizational committees to protect and promote regional sports such as the OSFO (Organization of Sports Federations of [Oceania](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)), OSA (Oceania Sports Alliance) and OAA (Oceania Athletics Association).

The main music genre in this part of the world is called the Pacific Reggae. It’s the offspring of mixing blues, jazz and mento with a repeated rhythm that will give you chills.

Yet each island has its specific traditional music and dance that have been passing over generations like the Hula dance in Polynesia and the Kaimatoa in Kiribati.  


But nothing can stand in the face of the ancestral war cry of The Haka dance of the Māori culture originating in New Zealand. It was done to scare their opponents; the warriors would use aggressive facial expressions, foot-stamping and rhythmic body slapping while singing: “Ka mate, ka mate! ka ora! ka ora!”, the song wonders if that battle would be the death of them or would they live!  


***Take a Walk***

Oceania is a beautiful land of beaches, forests, deserts, lakes, waterfalls, mountains and everything in between. Here are our picks of [Oceania’s ](https://globitopia.com/oceania-facts/)many hidden gems.

***Waitomo glowworm caves - New Zealand***

Get ready to be amazed by the magical bioluminescent larvae above; as you glide into the world-famous Waitomo Glowworm Caves with expert guides to explain the caves’ geological significance. Enjoy other activities, such as black water rafting, zip-line activities, Ruakuri Bushwalk hiking and the Waitomo caves museum tours. This place has the whole package!  


***Lake MacDonnell - Australia***

[Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)is full of salt lakes but none is compared to the remarkable Lake MacDonnell which is a few kilometers south of Penong. The lake is split by a causeway with dreamy pink on one side and relaxing blue on the other side. It’s totally worth a stop for a picture especially in spring and summer times when the sun is casting its rays over the shimmering pink.  
 

***Bouma National Heritage Park - Taveuni Island, Fiji***

It’s a 150 sq. km rainforest to satisfy your love of nature. a particular highlight of the Bouma Park is the crater lake of Tagimaucia where the rare Tagimaucia flower blooms. You can also visit the Tavoro Waterfalls where you can swim in the cool volcanic pools and take photos of the veil-like streams of water in the background.

You can hike through the rainforest to ancient ruins near Vidawa and kayak the Lavena Coastal Walk; admiring the rare tropical plants and the impressive diversity of birds.  


***Man-Made Wonders***

Oceanian people have built wonders over the years starting with the heaviest coin on earth thousands of years ago to out-of-this-world buildings and towns in recent years.

***Sydney Opera House - Australia***

A world-famous architectural wonder standing on [Sydney](https://globitopia.com/sydney-the-finest-harbor-in-the-world/) Harbor welcoming people from all over the world to enjoy spectacular events within. It's the youngest site to ever enter the UNESCO World Heritage Site list due to its exceptional engineering innovation. If you’re into classy tuxedo nights, we recommend booking a concert there on your next trip to [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/).

***Hobbiton - New Zealand***

A place for the die-hard fans of the magical world of “The Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit”. It’s the original movie set for the outstanding trilogies. The site is open for tourists in Matamata, New Zealand.

Tours with experienced guides will take you through the Hobbiton highlights including the Hobbit holes, the Green Dragon Inn, Shire’s rest and the party tree. You will notice how exquisitely this place was created down to the last leave! No wonder that the Hobbiton has won many honorable and cultural awards.

***Rai of Yap - Yap Island, Micronesia***

Imagine walking around with a man-sized stone to pay for your shopping list! Well, the Yapese did that. They even crossed seas with the “Rai stones” to trade with neighboring islands. The Yap Island is only 100 km² with an amazing indigenous culture that goes back to 500 AD. Don’t miss the chance to capture a photo with the Aragonite stones that are believed to be the world’s heaviest currency. Some of the stones weigh 7 tons. The best time to pay a visit to the Yap Island is around the annual Homecoming Summer Festival on June the 15th to experience Canoe rides, stick dances and traditional clothes and crafts.

***Fun Fact***

***Emu VS Humans*** 

Back in 1932, about 20.000 emus invaded the fields and ate the crops in the Campion district in [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/). Those were times of the worldwide great economic depression. The farmers requested aid from the Australian military to defend their food. Machine guns were useless against the smart and incredibly fast-moving emus. The Australian troops realized it was a lost cause and stood down after wasting 25.000 ammo in killing only 200 emus. Long story short, the mighty emu overcame the man!",Oceania Facts - An overview of “Lands of the Pacific”,,Globitopia,,0,2021-10-02 11:48:06

1. Is 3 days really enough time? 
2. We already know we want to see a sunrise &amp; sunset, field of lights &amp; take in some local culture. There's just so many different experiences to choose from. Which tours or experiences are the most worth while?
3. If we went to Alice Springs &amp; surrounds, what is there to do there? Is it worth it? 1 or 2 nights? 
4. Also we want to do hire car, does this limit us in what we can access?
5. Do we just need a park pass to come &amp; go? 
6. If we want to take in other national parks near by &amp; the waterhole, is the park pass enough or is there more entry cost on top?

TravelHacks,"I use a vape with CBD for pain relief for a chronic pain condition. My husband surprised me with a trip to Cancun just before Christmas, and of course I would like to have less pain during that trip. I researched the legality of bringing in and using CBD in Mexico, and I have found that it's legal as long as it contains less than one percent of THC and the packaging states it was derived from hemp. No problem there. I was shocked to discover that it's the actual VAPE that is illegal to bring into Mexico! In my quest for answers, I discovered that there are lots of vape shops in Mexico, and in Cancun, and the presidential order banning vapes had been deemed unconstitutional. Also, there were several accounts of travelers being ~~fined~~ extorted by Mexican customs officials for bringing a vape in to the country. They were told that the fine is $200, but the official would ""let it go"" for a fee of anywhere from $50-$100. Some people who responded had their vapes confiscated. 

I have traveled Europe and Australia, but this is my first trip to Mexico. Does anyone here have any recent (within the last year) experience with this issue?

I know the easy answer is ""Don't bring it,"" which is what my husband's answer will likely be, but taking CBD orally is not nearly as effective on my chronic nerve pain.

My team and I have just launched our app, “Tripsido,” on the Google Play store - it’s essentially a platform designed to help connect like-minded people traveling to the same destination(s) over the same dates. We’d love for anyone to download it and try it out here:  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripsido](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripsido)   


As we've just launched, we don't have many users right now - so we're asking anyone to post their upcoming trips that they'd like to meet up with other people on! Of course, the more trips we have posted, the greater chance we have of success as others search to find existing trips to join. The hope is that it'll make it a lot easier for people to find others to travel with, rather than posting in various forums etc. - \*especially\* whilst you're out on the move.

TravelHacks,"Hi all,
Im sure what im about to say alot of people may already know but for those who dont, here is how i usually get a better seat on a packed flight.

In airlines that offer advanced seat selection if the remaining options are free seats that  are way in the back and the front seats that are charged extra then i just dont pick a seat. The day of the flight the airline will just assign me any seat free of charge even if its in the front. If you buy a ticket airlines are obligated to give you a seat regardless unless its a standby ticket.

So just wait, the flight will probably get more packed. And the remaining free seats will be taken because people feel like they have to pick a seat right away. Thats what the airlines want you to think. You are putting it up to chance so it you may not always get a great seat. It does help if you are a rewards member because they may take that into account. If you are feeling ballsy enough you can even try to ask the front end agent if there are any free upgrades. They may be nice enough to do it.

Ive done this for AA and Jetblue and the worst seat ive gotten is probabbly row 15 with a plane of 30 rows. Best ive gotten is row 9 (2 rows after first class). I cant speak for other airlines but i imagine for theones that have early seat selection (most of them do) its similar.",How to get a better seat on a packed flight,,ea0995,,11,2021-09-27 15:39:19

It's home to one of the most picturesque landscapes, unspoiled jungles, panoramic beaches, marble caves, rich biodiversity and unparalleled number of plant and animal species. It’s unquestionably the most beautiful continent on the planet. Keep reading to learn more about [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) facts and secrets.

***Pin on the Map***

***Map of the continent***

South America is the world’s 4th largest continent after Asia, Africa and North America with an area of 17.84 million km². Most of the South American countries are located within the western and southern hemispheres. However, Guyana, French Guiana, Venezuela, Suriname, parts of Ecuador, parts of Brazil, and nearly all of Colombia are in the northern hemisphere. The continent has 12 countries and 3 dependent territories.

Brazil is the largest country in [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) and the fifth widest land in the world covering 8.516 million km².

Suriname is the smallest independent South American country which only covers 163,820 km². French Guiana is the smallest land in [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) that covers only 91,000 km² but it’s a French territory after all.

***On the land***

South America meets the Caribbean Sea in the north, the Atlantic Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west. The Isthmus of Panama connects North and [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) altogether.

South America boasts no shortage of great rivers like the Paraná, the Paraguay, the Rio Negro and the Orinoco rivers. The second-longest river in the world -the Amazon - runs through [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/).

Starting from the Andes Mountains of Peru, The Amazon and its tributaries flow through Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil, before finishing a 6437-kilometer journey at the Atlantic Ocean.

The freshwater provided suitable land for rainforests to grow. The tropical South America region represents the greatest concentration of tropical rainforest in the world. The Amazon Rainforest is the world’s largest Rainforest that covers about 5.5 million km² of the continent and spreads through 8 South American countries.

There are many other enormously beautiful rainforests in [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/), such as the Caatinga rainforest which lies around the São Francisco River in Brazil and The Valdivian temperate rainforest that covers 248,100 km² in Chile and Argentina.

It’s the only continent where you can find a mountain range that spans the full length of its western side; The Andes are the longest continental mountain range in the world with 7,000 km in length and a passage through 7 countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina. The Andes have 2 different climate zones: the Wet Andes and the Dry Andes.

The Andes have plenty of the highest mountains of the world. The Aconcagua Mountain of the Andes is around 7.000 m tall and it’s the tallest mountain in the world outside of Asia.

The peak of Ecuador’s Mount Chimborazo in The Andes where Earth’s bulge is the furthest point on Earth from Earth's center. It's the closest point on Earth to the stars!

[South America ](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/)has the 8th largest desert in the world. The Patagonian desert extends from the Andes in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east with an area of 572,883 km² in Argentina, but the Atacama desert in Chile is way more famous for being the driest nonpolar place on earth and being completely devoid of animal and botanical life.

This continent with its huge rainforests, glaciated mountains and remarkable deserts is home to different ecosystems with thousands of species endemic to the region. The Amazon Rainforest alone provides a home for one-tenth of the entire world’s animal species including some of the finest wildlife like the jaguars, anteaters and the vicious piranha.

The Andes have a vast array of their own fauna to mesmerize the biologists with more than 1,700 species of birds, almost 600 species of reptiles and about 600 species of mammals, such as the mountain tapir -also known as the Andean Tapir- which is the largest mammal in the tropical Andes region and the friendly Lamas.

Even the harsh Patagonian desert has more than 500 animal species that survive in waterless land and hot weather like the famous pumas, the “huemul” deer which is the most endangered deer in[ South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) and “pichi” the Patagonian armadillo.

The climate varies widely due to the sheer size of the land. There is a wide tropical zone around the equator that is usually hot, humid and susceptible to tropical rains such as Ecuador, Brazil and Colombia.

A temperate zone is found in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay which usually has warm humid summers and mild winters.

An arid deserted zone is found in Chile and Argentina in the Patagonian and Atacama deserts. Besides, a polar frosty region is found in Ushuaia; a city in Argentina located in the southernmost tip of [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) and believed to be “the end of the world”.  

Sadly, a beautiful continent like this is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis especially in Chile, western Argentina, western Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

The most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake; a 10-minute earthquake with over 1.500 deaths. The tremors caused localized tsunamis that severely damaged the Chilean coast with 25 m waves.  
 

South America also has over 200 beautiful scenic volcanos. The Andean volcanic belt has 4 volcanic zones; Northern, Central, Southern, and Austral. The Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) is the main volcano zone in the world; it extends from Peru to Chile and has the highest active volcano in the world: Ojos Del Salado which is 6,893 meters tall.

[South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) is facing the threats of deforestation and the Amazonian wildfires. They’re globally disastrous acts that lead to climate change which is melting the Andean glaciers causing floods and rising sea levels, species extinctions, wildlife endangerment, water stress, pollution, more diseases, decreased yields and food shortage.

***Meet the People***

South America is the 4th populous continent in the world with 434.9 million people living there. Brazil is the most crowded country with around 212 million people.

There are over 600 different languages spoken in the continent. Due to the Spanish colonization of the area from 15th century to 19th century, Spanish is the most spoken language in [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) with 210 million speakers, edging out Portuguese by a few millions.

Indigenous languages are still practiced like the Quechua which is spoken by six to eight million speakers across the Andean region.

The world became familiar with [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) when Christopher Columbus first stepped onto the land in 1498, but civilization there existed way before that. The Inca Empire had its mesmerizing art and architecture around Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia.

It might be a piece of heaven on earth, but the uneven land/wealth distribution and eco-political conflicts are among the reasons behind the struggle of a few nations with poverty such as Suriname and Bolivia. While other countries, such as Chile and Uruguay are considered rich countries in [South America.](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/)

South America is known for its love of football; many of the world-ranked footballers came from this land. These include, the Argentinian legends Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi and the Brazilian stars Pelé and Ronaldinho.

The World Cup took place on the South American lands 5 times; twice in Brazil in 1950 and 2014, Uruguay in 1930, Chile in 1962, and Argentina in 1978.

Brazil has won the most titles of all times with 5 wins. Uruguay and Argentina won the title as well.

This land gave the world some of the unique sports influenced by the sand and seas. These include the Footvolley originating on the Copacabana Beach.

The music in this part of the world is so vibrant and alive that you can’t help but to dance to the beating rhythms of the Brazilian Samba, the Chilean Nueva Canción, the Colombian Cumbia and the Argentinian Tango.

Percussion instruments are the main ones for creating these unique syncretic melodies of song, dance and performance.

***Take a Walk***

[South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) is full of jaw-dropping gems, especially fascinating landscapes. The natural beauty there is one-of-a-kind. 

***Uyuni Salt Flat - Bolivia***

Let's start our trip with one of the most beautiful spots on earth. The Uyuni Salt Flat is believed to be the outcome of the evaporation of a prehistoric lake, the nearly 11,000 sq. km. of bright-white salt is the world's largest salt lake. The best time to visit the Uyuni Salt Flats in Bolivia is between December and April when the wet weather creates a magical mirror effect, so don't miss the chance to have a photograph with the world's biggest mirror.

***Canaima National Park - Venezuela***

Welcome to the 3rd biggest national park in the world covering 30,000 sq. km. it's home to the highest waterfall on earth: the Angel falls which are 979 meters tall.

For only 4 US dollars; you can easily enter this UNESCO World Heritage Site to enjoy hiking, mountain climbing, boat trips, swimming and making friends with wild rare species, such as the Linnaeus's two-toed sloth and the white-faced saki. Just watch out for the South American bushmaster and the cougar.

***The Marble Caves - Chile***

Let's head to one of the most extraordinary spots in the world. The water slowly carved out the solid rocks over the years in General Carrera Lake forming those mesmerizing colorful hues.

You can either book a kayak tour or a boat tour that will take you from Chile Chico City to the marble caves.

Always choose a sunny morning. That way, your trip will be way calmer in the rocky lake while the sun is illuminating the caves and the turquoise water for some really awesome photos.

***Man-Made Wonders*** 

From wonder walls on the surface to a whole church carved underground; People in [South America ](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/)built wonders.

***Redeemer Jesus - Brazil***

The most famous landmark in [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) is definitely Christ the Redeemer statue on Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, it’s a 38-meter tall sculpture recognized as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.

Your trip there is not only for a photo with the statue but also for the scenic views of the mountainous landscape and the splendid Atlantic Coasts.

***Machu Picchu - Peru***

Let’s take a trip back in time to the 15th-century mysterious Incan citadel of Machu Picchu. It was built by the Incan Empire with dry polished stones around 1450 AD in the Andes Mountains around 7,000 feet above sea level.

This place will leave you amazed by the interesting details of how people succeeded in moving the heavy rocks without any high-tech vehicles, how they could cut the rocks so delicately and make them fit together so perfectly that not even a paper can come in between two stones. No wonder that this place is one of the new Seven Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site!

***Salt Cathedral - Colombia***

A hidden gem in [South America](https://globitopia.com/south-america-facts/) carved entirely out of salt in a former salt mine in Zipaquirá around 600 feet underground.

It goes back to the 1930s when miners built a sanctuary to pray for protection from toxic gases and explosions. The work was so dangerous that they believed that coming out alive from this place is a miracle.

Zipaquirá's miners and religious figures in this deeply Catholic country pushed the Colombian government to convert this miraculous site into a church in 1953.

It was a massive challenge to work underground, but the efforts paid off to a marvel of architecture that will take your breath away. It’s even called “the first wonder of Colombia”.

***Fun Fact***

***What lies beneath!***

In 2011, Brazilian scientists at a meeting of the Geophysical Society in Rio de Janeiro announced the discovery of a new river “under” the Amazon; The Rio Hamza or the Hamza River -named after the head of scientists who found the groundwater flow- is a subterranean river that lies 4 km underneath the Amazon River.

Scientists believe that it has the same length as the Amazon. It even runs in the same direction but the Hamza River is hundreds of times wider than the Amazon!",South America facts - An overview of “The New Eden”,,Globitopia,,0,2021-09-27 07:32:20

TravelHacks,"I’ve been reading Reddit like crazy and I think I understand, but maybe not? Traveling from US to Paris for 6 days, with an unlocked iPhone 8. I want to be able to use all my phone apps while I’m there, and get notified somehow (call, text, email) if need be. 

So: Either before I leave or when I land, I buy a SIM card that’ll work in FR, pop that in and now my phone is operating off that company’s network and everything on my phone is still right there, and I can send and receive new emails (assuming I’m on WiFi or get a data plan), is that right? Also, would any of those sim options allow me to call/text to US, or would calls and text be limited to the Euro zone? (And I do get that I’ll have a European # which I’ll have to share with anyone who may need to reach me, I’m very proud of myself for following that part.)

TravelHacks,"My grandfather has been asking for a grandpa-granddaughter or grandpa-daughter-granddaughter trip to Vegas for years but the timing and budget were never right and we never went. Well, I´m forcing the timing to be right after my exams next spring (april or may). The question is, how do you do Vegas plus the Grand Canyon (a more recent deep desire from him) right as a healthy 24F and a 72M who has hypertension, less mobility and does NOT handle stress well?(Anticipation stress is ok for him but any conflict/fear isn´t). He´s as mobile as you´d expect an elderly 72M to be so he can do a few hours of walking but a hike into the Grand Canyon feels like a bad idea. In Vegas, his primary goal is to walk the Strip and soak in the atmosphere. Personally, I´d also like to see a show and add Antelope Canyon to the plans but idk if the latter is a good idea since idk anything about Antelope Canyon except that it´s really pretty. He is very willing to see a couple shows of my choosing. Is Antelope Canyon grandfather safe and are there any shows we should absolutely try to see? What are some things in either area that we should make time for? Are there tours or services that make less accessible places more elderly friendly (not wheelchairs but like vehicle tours to the Colorado River so he doesn't have to hike the Canyon, expeditions into Antelope Canyon that take very easy paths, whatever an equivalent is for Vegas, etc.)We´ll likely have $3500-$4000 including flights from the northeast for this trip--the duration or actual dates are uncertain atm.

TravelHacks,"Hi r/TravelHacks, I posted this on r/Travel but didn’t get any feedback so I’m cross-posting here in hopes that you can be of assistance.

I've tentatively used trip.com via SkyScanner to book a Thrifty rental car in Vegas; the price for a few days is several hundred dollars less than anything I've been able to find elsewhere, including on the Thrifty booking site. It's a pay-at-counter, cancel anytime booking with a confirmation number that successfully pulls up a booking with the correct price and details on the Thrifty website. To double check this, I called Thrifty and had one of their agents confirm the booking and price in the system, which they did, with the caveat that the price is correct if that's what the travel agency (trips.com) quoted for ""non-residents"", which I didn't quite get, but he wasn't able to provide more detail. They also told me a damage waiver was already included from what they could see, though I can't see it on my end.

I've seen lots of mixed reviews about trip.com on Tripadvisor, Trustpilot, Sitejabber, and r/travel threads such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/b4sxzv/does_anyone_have_experience_with_tripcom/), the general takeaway of which seems to be it's a reliable enough booking site if you don't have unforeseen changes/cancellations. However, most of those reviews pertain to booking flights and hotels.

My concern is showing up day of and having Thrifty refuse to honor my booking or charging me much more because trip.com's price is inaccurate or didn't process correctly. If you have rental-car specific experience with this site, I'd love to hear it!",Does anybody have experience renting cars through trip.com?,,different_better_dog,,7,2021-09-22 02:39:15

Europe is home to high mountains and long rivers. It also has rich history and wealthy countries. People go there to see the Parthenon, the pope and much more. Keep reading to learn about [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)facts and secrets.

***On The Land***

Europe is the second-smallest continent in the world After Australia. Most of the European countries lie in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. The continent has 44 countries. [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)is home to the biggest country (Russia) and the smallest country (Vatican City) in the world!

***Map of Europe***

Europe has a lot of rivers. These include The Danube, The Rhine and The Loire rivers. However, The Volga is the longest river in the continent. The Volga flows for around 3,531 km in Russia. The Volga's journey ends in the Caspian Sea.

Europe has plains, forests, lakes, mountains and even volcanoes. The Alps are the highest mountain range in [Europe](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/). It stretches across eight countries. However, the highest peak in the continent lies in The Caucasus Mountains. It's called Mount Elbrus which reaches a height of 5,642 m (18,510 ft) above sea level.

Around a third of the surface area of [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)is covered by forests. These include The Bavarian Forest, Wild Taiga forest, Hallerbos Forest and Bialowieza Forest. The Bialowieza Forest is the largest and oldest forest on the continent. This massive land covers parts of Poland and Belarus. In the last 3 decades, the European forest area has increased by around 9%.

Europe is home to many kinds of wildlife. The big five animals in Europe are the European bison, the wolf, the brown bear, the wolverine, and the lynx. The continent is also home to many unique animals such as the European mink, the marbled polecat, and the European pine marten. The Eurasian wolf, the polar bear, the European adder are among the most dangerous animals in [Europe](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/).

Europe's weather is different from one place to another. In Western Europe, it's usually cloudy with warm summers and cool winters. In southern Europe, the summers are often hot and dry while the winters are mostly mild. In Central and northern [Europe](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/), the weather is mild in the summer and very cold in the winter. Most European countries have four seasons. However, some countries have only two seasons which are the rainy season and the dry one.

Europe faces some threats. Some of these hazards are natural such as floods, forest fires, storms and earthquakes. Climate change is also a main concern to many Europeans. Climate change can cause an increase in the number of floods and heavy rainstorms in the continent. A recent study said that Humans cause climate change by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air

***Meet the people***

Europe is the third-most-populous continent in the world with more than 748 million people. Russia is the most inhabited nation in [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)with more than 144 million people living there.

There are many ethnic groups and cultures all over Europe. People there speak more than 200 languages. English is the most common language as it's the favorite second language of Europeans. Most Europeans can speak more than one language. A research said that more than 50% of people living in [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)are bilingual. This means that they can speak two languages. Around 25% of Europeans are trilingual. That means that they can speak three languages!

1993, The European Union was founded. This group has 27 European countries. The union allows free movement of goods, services and people between its members. Many countries in Europe are ranked among the world's richest nations. Luxembourg is the wealthiest country in [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)while Germany has the largest economy in the continent.

Sports are very important in [Europe](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/). Football (soccer) is, without doubt, the most practiced and watched sport in the continent. Germany and Spain hold the record in winning The UEFA European Football Championship (EURO). Both teams won the title three times. Many European countries hosted the World Cup. The First one was Italy in 1934 and the last one was Russia in 2018. Germany and Italy were the most successful European teams in the World Cup as they both won it 4 times.

European countries also dominate the Winter Olympic Games. This event features sports such as speed skating, figure skating, curling, and ice hockey. Norway is the most successful nation in that competition. The country has won 368 medals including 132 gold medals.

Music is very important in [Europe](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/). Many famous singers and bands came from the continent. These include The Beatles. This rock band was formed in Liverpool, England. Many experts believe that it was the most successful band in history. The Beatles dominated the world stage in the 1960s. Édith Piaf is also one of the most famous female singers of all time. The French icon sang about love and sorrow.

Europe is also known for its art. The continent gave the world great artists and painters. One of them was Claude Monet. The French painter is considered to be one of the greatest artists in history. Another one was Leonardo da Vinci. The Italian legend made one of the most widely-known paintings, The Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is displayed in the most-visited museum in the world, the Louvre.

***Walk around***

Europe is full of attractions. From stunning mountains to astonishing museums, there's something for everyone.

***Natural wonders***

Europe has an array of landscapes and natural wonders that attract millions of tourists from all around the globe. It might be difficult to choose from. Here are some places you shouldn't miss.

***Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia***

Head to the oldest and largest national park in Croatia. The jaw-dropping site is located between two mountain ranges. These are the Mala Kapela and the Lička Plješivica. The huge park covers an area of around 300 km2. The park is famous for its lakes. There are 16 named lakes in the park and some smaller unnamed lakes. The park was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997. Thousands of tourists flock to the site every year to enjoy its magnificent natural beauty.

***The Blue Grotto, Italy***

Do you like walking into caves? What about sailing into one? That's right! Grotta Azzurra (or the blue Grotto) is on the coast of the island of Capri, southern Italy. It offers its visitors a chance to sail on its blue water. That special color is caused by the Sunlight passing through an underwater cavity and shining through the seawater. In the past, sailors used to avoid going into the grotto as they believed it was full of witches and monsters! Don't worry, the site is safe. You just need to follow the weather forecast as sometimes the grotto is closed due to rough sea conditions.

***Preikestolen, Norway***

This site isn't for people who are afraid of heights but it's definitely for adventure lovers. Preikestolen is a steep cliff in Rogaland, Norway. It rises 604 meters (1,982 ft.) above a fiord called Lysefjord. The hike to Preikestolen is around eight kilometers, and it would take you about four hours to get there. When you get to its flat top, you can look down to a hair-raising scene of the fiord. Some Adrenaline Lovers like to jump off the cliff using parachutes! In recent years, Preikestolen has become one of the most visited natural tourist attractions in Norway.

***Man-made wonders***

Europe isn't all about parks and mountains. People in [Europe ](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)built outstanding structures. Here are some man-made sites you should consider visiting.

***Eiffel tower***

In 1889, Paris hosted ""The Universal Exposition."" This astonishing event attracted more than 32 million visitors. Each and every one of them gazed in awe at the wonder of iron, the Eiffel Tower. This staggering structure held the record of the tallest building in the world from 1889 to 1930 at 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall. To this day, tourists still flock to take pictures near the building. Besides, it's the favorite destination for romantic marriage proposals.

***The Sistine Chapel, Vatican City***

In the heart of the smallest country in the world, there's a sacred place that attracts millions of tourists every year. It's The Sistine Chapel. The chapel is very important to Catholics as it hosts ceremonies that are led by the pope. It's also the place where the Cardinals elect the new pope when there is a vacancy. However, the site is a tourist attraction because of its mesmerizing paintings that decorate the walls and ceiling. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michelangelo is one of the most celebrated works of art in the world. The famous ceiling shows scenes from the Bible. These include The Creation of Adam and the Last Judgement.

***The Parthenon, Greece***

This notorious landmark is located in Athens. It is one of the most visited sites in the world. The Parthenon is a marble temple that was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena. The site is a symbol of the power, wealth and culture of Ancient Greece. The building witnessed A LOT. From fire and wars to earthquakes and explosions, The Parthenon stood tall as a mark of ingenuity and perseverance.

***Fun fact***

***The Knighted Penguin!***

You may have heard stories about Knights and their epic battles in The Middle Ages of [Europe](https://globitopia.com/europe-facts/)! But did you know that there is a much *cuter* knight that still lives in a zoo? Meet Sir Nils Olav III! He is a king penguin who lives in Edinburgh Zoo, Scotland. He’s the mascot and colonel-in-chief of the Norwegian King’s Guard. In 2008, king Harald V made Nils Olav III a knight in The Norwegian Army!","Europe facts - An Overview Of The ""land of The Parthenon and the pope""",,Globitopia,,5,2021-09-21 20:12:42

TravelHacks,In January 2020 I bought a ticket to Milan on Alitalia. Everyone knows what happens next and I’m stuck with a $600 airline voucher in the middle of a pandemic. Now I find out Alitalia is going out of business on Oct 15th. I’ve called them multiple times and get stuck on hold then mysteriously disconnect after 30-45minutes on hold. I’ve also emailed 2 customer service emails (customer.relationsNYC@alitalia.it and richiestatcv@alitalia.it) without reply.

TravelHacks,"Yuppp with the newer restrictions in place I had to scramble to get a 72 hour covid test. I spent an hour at the library printing all of our itinerary information, paperwork, vaccine card copies and test results and even bought a lovely folder to carry everything in.

When we got to the boarding line in Newark, NJ it was such a cluster fuck. No one checked a single thing, literally not even our passports. They did not check our passports at our origin site either which was ATL.

I repeat, I boarded an international flight and no one looked at my passport. I could have been literally anyone.

They did check our PP in Rome customs but nothing else. That line took under 5 minutes. It was honestly glorious, when I went to Rome in September of 2016 the line was 2+ hours long.

I thought maybe it was a one off but after we checked into our hotel the concierge was telling us they were surprised how many guests told him this was happening. So crazy to me, I expected it to be such a long and stressful process. It took me 15 mins to get past security only showing my DL, and another 10 minutes to board bc they were rapidly just scanning our boarding passes.

Obviously don’t use this situation to try and skirt the restrictions but also maybe take all of the horror stories with a grain of salt.

Edit: Also all of the posts about Rome being extremely strict on vaccine cards are also incorrect. We’ve eaten out 7 times so far and visited 4 museums and we have only had our CDC cards checked at Vatican and one restaurant.",Just landed in Rome and not one person checked ANY of our paperwork.

TravelHacks,"I'm trying to go on a trip with my partner to a Latin American country. 

I had travel credit from travel plans that were disrupted by the pandemic. It said it was a ""voucher"" which I would assume meant just credit with the airline. 

The trip I am now planning to take is less per person than the original flight I was going to go on alone. So I hoped I could use some of it toward my partner's ticket, since mine was completely covered. But they told me I could only use it for a flight or other services for myself. (I actually got different answers about this each time I called, but when it was time to actually book the ticket, they wouldn't let me use it toward my partner's ticket.)

However, since I didn't use all of my credit, they said they would send me a voucher for the difference that would not expire for another year. One person told me I could use *that* credit toward my partner's ticket, which just seems silly because the end result would be the same, but I was going to do that as a workaround. 

Yet once again I've received contradictory information, as the last person I spoke with told me that this was not possible, I could only use that new voucher for flights or other services for myself. 

Does anyone know if this is actually accurate, or should I ask to speak to a manager/supervisor about this?

And any other tips about dealing with Avianca right now? It seems like a mess. Their staff don't seem to be on the same page about what their policies are, and when choosing the line for English they are not fluent enough to communicate easily. I actually speak a fair amount of Spanish and sometimes I just go into Spanish and it helps, but then there can be misunderstandings as well.",Using Avianca travel credit for another person?,,academico5000,,0,2021-09-10 18:43:04

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone, i‘m new here so please pardon me if this topic has already been debated to death. 

We have had a riding tour booked to Lofoten Norway in October since 2019. We originally wanted to go last year but covid etc. So we changed our plans to this year. Turns out it’s pretty complicated to get from Zurich, Switzerland to Leknes or Svolvær. We booked a complicated trip with kiwi.com since they were somewhat affordable. 

1 week later one of our 4 flights was canceled. According to kiwi it would cost 440 CHF to rebook to a different flight. The same flight booked individually over Norwegian Airlines would be 120 CHF. So after none of my messages were ansered and we weren’t sure if we rebooked they wouldn’t just change a different flight for another fee i canceled the entire trip and asked for a refund. 1 second later they changed the status of the booking to „rebooked to later flight“. That would be fine, except we miss the connection to the last flight. 

They are driving me a bit crazy. Does anyone have a phone number for kiwi.com or any advice on what else i could try? 

Anything would be greatly appreciated at this point!",Kiwi.com help?,,ari_1992,,3,2021-09-08 19:48:15

TravelHacks,"Being unfamiliar with the way my destination city looked, and the names of the neighborhoods, I assumed my listing would be within the bubble of possibility, which encompassed a few dozen blocks in the city center right where I wanted to be.

The actual address was only revealed after I'd paid. Sonsonate wasn't the name of the neighborhood, but referred to the city of Sonsonate 50 miles to the west. Thinking this was just a website error I shared a screenshot of the incorrect map with the host and asked for a refund. The host replied ""sorry but the listing title was correct"", so I contacted customer service.

Support responded the next day saying there was no violation of policy, so I would only be entitled to a refund of the $50 cleaning fee unless the host voluntarily refunded! They would try to negotiate on my behalf but could not force the host.

The host did refund the money after a rather long holdout, then a few days later I resumed searching the same area for lodging and again saw the same listing showing up in the city center, a hole for others to fall down and waste days of their time. Thinking the customer service agent that ""helped"" me may have been confused, I clicked ""report listing"" and shared my story along with screenshots. A different AirBNB support team member then responded:

TravelHacks,"Hello, recently I was made aware that the travel ban to Sweden was done on Monday I believe? ( I may be wrong ) direct flights to Sweden from the USA is getting denied entry into the country due to covid-19. I had read online via the embassy(s) website for Sweden &amp; the US embassy in Sweden that traveling from a Nordic country such as Denmark for example. Based on what I read, the regulation for Sweden(s) processing is that whichever country you had come from even if it is a transit country. It will be considered entering Sweden from that country, as long as you are processed through the transit countries border control. But, since the border police official website for Sweden states that there is no entry ban for people arriving from the Nordic countries. So with all this being said, I got my tickets to Copenhagen via flight and then take a train to Sweden so with this being said, this should work since it’s in the entry information on the Swedish Border Police. tips or advice anyone could give me?

It’s obviously a typo, there’s an extra letter on the end which makes a recognizable name, not a name. I called the airline, who told me to call Expedia, with whom I booked the flight. Expedia told me it was fixed, then called me back hours later to give me the runaround, and tried to get me to cancel the flight.

This is a big 3 week, multi-country trip planned, and canceling the flight isn’t really an option given that prices are now 5x what they were when I booked it.

For this reason, I would very much like to know if anyone else has been in this situation and can recommend what to do? I have already contacted a friend of mine and he is going to Greece to just relax on-site for a month. However, I would like to combine both, i.e. continue my university projects, do an internship in the meantime and have enough space for relaxation. I am very open to travel anywhere in Europe and would be happy if you have been in a similar situation, what you have done, how you have prepared your plan, and what to look out for.

The bot that searches a \*ton\* of flight and hotel prices for weekend trips in North America. It combines those flights and hotels together into trips, then sends you the cheapest ones (with links to Google Flights/Hotels for easy booking). The trips are usually Friday-Sunday, but we just started including trips for long weekends too.

It scans \~350 destinations every week and send you deals as it finds them. You should get 1-2 deals a week (we added a Premium option if you really want more). It's surprising how little money you can spend if you're flexible on location!

This has been bugging me for some time.
So I upgraded to this airline from economy to business class, hence baggage allowance has been upgraded from 30kg to 45kg. The thing is,its just the transit flight, the destination flight is economy, I weighed my bags the sum is 40kg. If I purchase extra 10 kg it would equate to the upgrade, but the upgrade is just for the transit flight, what should I do? Should I let it slide because I doubt anyone will weight the bags in transit because its just 2 hours.

TravelHacks,"My brother booked his honeymoon flights through Expedia (from Canada to Cancun) about 3 months ago. This week, he went to check in 24 hours before his flight, only to learn that his flights were cancelled. He called Expedia and they said that not only did they send him an email about this a month ago, but he apparently clicked the link and accepted the change (apparently he accepted an airline voucher rather than a cash refund, yeah right).

I can understand him missing the email (he triple checked, it's not there) but no way is he dumb enough to accept changes and then get shocked when it's time to check in. He flies somewhere once a year on average and knows what he's doing.

When he logs into his Expedia account, it still shows the flights as is, as if nothing was cancelled. Of course Expedia say that's normal, and only the email would inform about the cancellation.

He ended up paying an extra couple thousand for new flights, which now have a stop in the US and is double the travel time (**he also got his voucher converted to cash so no issues there**). He's asked Expedia to investigate their claim that they notified him and he accepted but does anyone else have experience or suggestions on how to deal with this  (**BESIDES never to book through Expedia, which I've told him for years**)?

I heard that all you need to do is basically use the passport in the respective country (Japanese for Japan and British for the UK) to leave and enter. Is there anyway of knowing the airline or the airport knows that you used two passports or what excuse to give as to why your entering for such a long time instead of school (ie visiting a family member)?

TravelHacks,"Hi there, 

Delta loves to change my flights repeatedly leading up to actually taking off. This typically happens to us, but I'm wondering if there's a better solve than this cat and mouse game I'm currently playing with them. 

The situation: Whenever we go from Seattle to Rochester, our flights with Delta get worse and worse as the months leading up, sometimes changing two, three, five, ten times before we actually take off. It def feels worse this year already. We bought our tix that had just 1 connection and then a month ago it changed to 2 connections, so I changed it at no cost (we used 28k miles for the main cabin) back to an earlier time to once again get that 1 connection. The 2 connections are the worst bc they always give us less than an hour in between flights and in the past whenever we've tried to make this 2nd connection we are literally running before the gate closes - this happens almost every time for the last 10 years of doing this flight. I have to say that not doing this flight for the last 2 years has been amazing bc of how stressful it can be (in the winter, carry on bags + winter gears, a small child who is cranky and doesn't want to run - while one of us sprints through ATL or Chicago... from one end to another... then getting 'tude for screaming to keep the gate open as they attempt to close it in slow mo... it's the opposite of fun). 

Where was I? Ok, so I already had to change this update once since getting our tix. They just sent another update that brings us back to this horrible scenario again (2 connections, less than an hour to get through huge airports). It's like they want to see us fail and cry. 

What is the best way to go about this while still keeping the cost the exact same? Do I keep updating (likely every month and likely day by day the week of the flight) or do I just leave the flight as they want, while it continues to update over and over and I play along with their dumb game until it's super close to our take-off day and then change it to how we like it? The risk of doing the latter is that a) we may not be able to sit together and b) we may get upcharged A LOT. 

If you've gone through this, your advice on the best approach is much appreciated. Thanks!","Delta keeps changing my flight, how to proceed",,yayunicorns,,4,2021-08-30 16:24:12

I know I will not be able to travel all of Europe in my time frame but Im willing to get to as many destinations as possible. I plan on purchasing the Eurail pass for two month unlimited train usage. What do you all recommend to have with me and what are some helpful tips to traveling Europe? Keeping in mind I have to be in Madrid July 5-11 for a music festival.

Next month, I’m presenting a community education lecture on creating a budget-friendly trip to Europe (from the USA).

I’m using my experience living in Europe and also my trips I have planned from the USA to Europe.

Or some combo of two hotels that we could do that would average around $500 per night. I want unusual options, ultra luxury options, options with great views or a unique perk.

Asia is the world’s largest continent as it covers 30% of the total land area. With vast lands comes great diversity in wildlife, climatic conditions, races, languages, religions and cultures. Keep reading to learn more about [Asia’s ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)facts and secrets.

***On The Land***

Asia covers 17.2 million square miles of land. Most of the Asian countries lie in the eastern and northern hemispheres. The continent has 48 countries as listed by the UN. [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is the largest country located entirely in [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)while the Maldives is the smallest nation by land area.

***Pin On The Map***

Asia is surrounded by the Arctic, Pacific and Indian oceans. Globally known as the Continent of Contrast; [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)has the highest point on Earth of Mount Everest which is 8.848 meters high, but it also has Earth's lowest elevation on land. That's the shores that surround the Dead Sea with 420 meters below sea level.  
 

Asia has the world’s largest forest area in Russia but you can also find countries with almost no trees at all, such as Qatar and Oman.

Nearly all the world climatic conditions are found in [Asia](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/). Most of the countries around the Equator are tropical. These include The Philippines, Singapore, Maldives and Indonesia.

Subtropical regions are found in Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Qatar, [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/). Siberia in central northern Asia is in the Tundra region.  
Even Arctic regions are found in [Asia](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/); Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon in Russia hold the record of coldest temperature ever recorded outside Antarctica.  


Asia is home to plenty of amazing land features that hold world records. These include the largest plateau in the world. The Tibetan Plateau stretches through Tibet, [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and India covering 2.5 million square kilometers.

The second deepest and the third-longest river in the world is the Yangtze River which runs across China. Asia has some of the world’s highest mountains. Over 130 mountains in [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)are higher than the highest mountain outside Asia.

Thousands of animal and botanical species have taken Asia as a habitat. You can find friendly species, such as the pandas and the moon orchid of Indonesia. However, be aware of the dangerous species that can easily kill you like oleander, komodo dragon, the deadly sharks of [Asia](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/).

The Asian Pacific region is a hazardous place as it lies in the most disaster-prone area of the world; the ring of fire. It’s a volcanic active area responsible for earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines and [Japan ](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/)are the main countries that suffer the most. Urbanization near the coasts and poorly designed cities increase the number and severity of disasters.

Asia suffered from many deadly epidemics and outbreaks throughout history especially from wild animals that can harbor viruses. These include the 2002 SARS pandemic originating from Guangdong in China and 2019 covid-19 starting in Wuhan in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Other local epidemics are the 1997 avian flu in Hong Kong and the 1998 Nipah virus in Malaysia.

***Meet the people***

Asia is the most populous continent in the world with 4.64 billion people speaking nearly 2.300 languages. The most spoken languages in [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)are Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian and Japanese.

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)has the highest population in Asia and the world with 1.4 billion people speaking nearly 302 different Chinese languages.

Asia was the birthplace of many religions and beliefs like Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism.

Islam and Hinduism are the most practiced religions in [Asia](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/).

You might be used to a handshake but it’s not the best way to greet people in Asia. Bring your hands together in a prayer gesture and give a slight bow or head-nodding. If you started a handshake, don’t be too firmly as it might mean that you’re aggressive and rude, Keep it light! This practice is common in Thailand, [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/), [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and South Korea.

It’s disrespectful to enter a temple or a mosque with your shoes on. This tradition is applied in homes and sometimes restaurants; kicking off your shoes before entry is an act of courtesy in Vietnam, India, China, Cambodia, [Japan ](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/)and South Korea.  


Many powerful economies are found in [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)such as Singapore, [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/), South Korea, [Japan ](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/)and Qatar. On the other hand, very poor countries such as, Myanmar, Nepal, Syria and Tajikistan are also located in Asia.  


Asian countries are the pioneers of many sports and games. Early forms of chess go back to India. The “Go” or “weichi” is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played till the current time. It was invented in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). The world-famous mind training game, the Sudoku, first appeared in [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/).

Asian countries are really famous for their martial arts which are fighting sports and other disciplines to maintain ultimate development of body and spirit. Many countries in [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)have their own forms of martial arts; Kung Fu and Sanda in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/), Judo and Karate in [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/), Sambo in Russia and Taekwondo in Korea.

The 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games were the first Olympics to adopt karate into the competition as (the International Olympic Committee IOC) now allows the host country to add authentic popular sports to the list of Olympic Games. 

Get your musical ears ready to enjoy a wide spectrum of tunes. Music differs from one region to another, starting with the Hindustani classics in India and electronic K-pop in South Korea, to the maqam in classical Iranian and Turkish music.  


***Take a Walk***

From megacities to magnificent islands, [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)is a pot of scenic natural wonders that will take your breath away.

***Tat Kuang Si Falls – Laos***

A spectacular place for swimming, hiking, picnics and enjoying nature with turquoise water and green scenery. A legend claims that a wise man dug deep into the ground and revealed the water, then a golden deer made a home under a big rock in the falls. The sound of water falling on the rock was a calling echo to draw people to the site. In the Lao language “Tat” means waterfall, “Kuang” means deer and “Si” means dig; the name says it all!

***Kelimutu National Park – Indonesia***  
 

Kelimutu National Park is located on the island of Flores where mount Kelimutu is known for the tri-colored volcanic lakes that change colors over time. Locals believe that the lakes carry the spirit of the ancestors; there’s a lake for old people, another for young men and the third one for wicked souls. It’s a beautiful place to watch the sun casting its rays over the sacred lakes.

It would be your lucky day if you ran into some of the world’s most endangered animals that live there such as, Javan Rusa, Red Junglefowl and Drongos birds.

***Valley of Flowers National Park – India***

It's a 47 kilometers Himalayan trek in Uttarakhand and it became a UNESCO world heritage site in 1988. No words can describe the beauty of this valley. It’s a piece of heaven on earth, an open pallet of natural colors of mesmerizing wildflowers, such as lilies, daisies, petunia, calendula and the rare blue primula. We advise you to take snacks and water bottles with you as this place hasn’t been ruined by local shops yet.

***Man-made wonders***

***Petra – Jordan***  
 

Let’s head south to a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It’s a city fully carved in pink stone so it was called ""The Red Rose city"" by the Nabateans around 150BCE.

It’s a jaw-dropping place witnessing how handy and artistic the first Arabs were about 2000 years ago.

***The Rain Vortex – Singapore***

It’s the world’s tallest indoor waterfall surrounded by beautiful green features in Jewel Changi Airport. It's a 40 m tall rain vortex that will draw your attention the moment you walk through the doors. Inspired by Singapore's heavy tropical rains and thunderstorms, the site was designed by Moshe Safdie’s architecture firm and built from 2014 to 2019 to recapture the rainwater and then reuse it again inside the building. It’s truly a man-made wonder.

***The Great Wall of China - China***

It’s probably the first thing that crosses your mind when you hear about Asia. Located in the center of [Asia](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, one of the Seven Wonders of the World and one of the largest man-made structures. This wall is an eyewitness to the rise and fall of dynasties, neighborly conflicts, and even a world war. Don't miss taking a picture by this astonishing monument.

***Fun Facts***

***Stare at the devil’s eye***

At the foot of the Kunlun Mountains in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/), there’s a hot water spring that resembles an eye when top viewed. The water sprayed by the spring contains a lot of sulfur that precipitated over the years and a red-brown circle is formed just like a person’s eye socket. The water in the center of the fountain continues to flow, creating a swirl that makes it more life-like.

It gets more interesting, the sulfur water makes the surrounding land barren, even birds and other animals do not like it there. Locals call it ""Aiken spring"" which means demon’s eyes in Mongolian.

*We are not sure if it’s a fun fact or a creepy one.*

***The Afro-Asian city***

Port Said, Egypt has a small district called Port Fouad. This district is separated from the rest of Port Said lands by the Suez Canal.  Port Fouad lies in [Asia ](https://globitopia.com/asia-facts/)while the rest of Port Said lies in Africa. Ferries that cross the Suez Canal daily will take you from African lands to Asian ones and vice versa For free! You can also enjoy the soothing voyage and a chance to greet dolphins and seagulls.","know more about ""The land of contrasts” - Asia",,Globitopia,,0,2021-08-24 22:37:31

***Wave The flag*** 

The US flag has 13 stripes in red and white. In the left corner, there's a blue rectangle with 50 stars. The stripes represent the 13 colonies that declared independence from the UK. The stars represent the 50 states of America. The current flag was ordered by president Dwight David Eisenhower in 1959 and was adopted in 1960.

***Sing along***

The national anthem of the United States is called ""The Star-Spangled Banner"". The history of the tune dates back to 1814. In that year, Francis Scott Key witnessed the US flag that was then called ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" flying above Fort McHenry during the US victory. That event inspired key to write his most famous poem. Key handed his poem to his brother-in-law Joseph H. Nicholson. Nicholson saw that the lyrics fit perfectly a melody made by John Stafford Smith in 1773.

The song took more than a century to become the official national anthem on March 3, 1931.

***Listen to the anthem***

***Pin On The Map*** 

The United States of America is a HUGE country. It's the fourth biggest country in the world as it covers around 6% of the world landmass. The US lies in North America and shares its borders with Canada in the north and Mexico in the south. The American land lies on two oceans (the Atlantic and the Pacific). The country has 50 states. Alaska is the biggest state and Rhode Island is the smallest one.

The US also controls many islands around the world such as Puerto Rico, American Samoa and Guam. Washington, D.C. is the capital city of the United States. However, it isn't a part of any state!

America's land is diverse. From mountains and rivers to glaciers and volcanoes, the US has it all. Denali in Alaska is the highest mountain in the US as it reaches 6,190 m (20,310 ft) above sea level. The country also has the tallest mountain in the world which is Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The distance between the base of the mountain and its summit is about 10,000 meters. The summit is around 4000 meters above sea level.

***Look In The History Book***

***First traces***

The USA is relatively young. However, the history of the lands goes WAY back. The first groups arrived in America thousands of years ago. The experts aren't exactly sure how they arrived in the American continent. But some believe they crossed a bridge connecting Eurasia to arrive in North America. This happened during the Ice Age. The first groups formed tribes and created cultures. They included Edina culture and Mississippian culture. These groups lived all over the continent. In the Pacific Ocean, The Polynesian people started settling the islands, which form now the state of Hawaii, between the first and 10th centuries. The native groups spoke different languages and created works of art.  

***The journey that changed everything***

In 1492, an Italian explorer named Christopher Columbus was trying to find a route from Europe to Asia. Instead, he stumbled upon the American continent. Columbus's journey paved the way for the arrival of other Europeans. Soon, European countries colonized America and the surrounding islands. The Europeans hurt the Native groups. They also brought new diseases that killed around 90 per cent of the Native American populations.

***The Land of The Free***

In the 1600s and 1700s, Britain controlled many colonies in America. The first permanent English settlement was called Jamestown. It was established in 1607 in Virginia. The colonies flourished under British control and people started migrating to America. During that time, Britain fought France in the Seven Years' War. This conflict was costly and Britain needed to tax the Americans.

On December 16, 1773, Americans dumped 342 chests of tea into the Boston Harbor. This event was called ""The Boston tea party"". It was the spark that started the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, the Thirteen British Colonies declared independence and formed The United States of America. Till 1783, the USA fought Britain to protect its freedom in the revolutionary war. The war ended and the USA remained a free country. After the war, George Washington became the first president of America. He led the nation till 1797.

***Expansion and conflict***

America's land expanded. The leaders bought vast lands. They also had to start wars to control other areas. However, the biggest problem America faced wasn't with a foreign enemy. It was inside the country. In the 1800s, there was a HUGE conflict. The northern states wanted to ban slavery while the southern ones wanted to keep it. The southern states' economy depended on agriculture. The white people of those states forced black slaves to work in plantations. In 1861, Abraham Lincoln became the United States President. Lincoln supported banning slavery. As a result, some states formed The Confederate States of America and fought against the United States of America. The war was bloody. However, the United States won. The USA became one country again and slavery was banned!

***Two World Wars and ONE world power***

In the 20th century, the USA took part in both world wars. In the first war, the USA fought with the Allied powers and won. After the end of this war in 1918, the American president Woodrow Wilson pushed the idea of the League of Nations to promote world peace and stop future wars. However, in 1939, World War II started. This war was the deadliest in history. The [USA](https://globitopia.com/usa-facts/) decided to stay neutral at the beginning of the war. However, in 1941, Japan attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbors. Thousands of Americans were killed and injured. As a result, the USA decided to enter the war. The USA played a vital role in ending the war and bringing victory to the Allies in 1945. The Allied powers included Britain and the Soviet Union.

After the end of World War II, a period of political rivalry started between the Soviet Union and the USA. Both countries wanted to be the most powerful nation on earth. This time was called ""the cold war"" as neither the Soviet Union nor the United States officially declared war on each other. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed and the [USA](https://globitopia.com/usa-facts/) became, undoubtedly, the strongest nation in the world.

Art can come in many forms. The artist can use his pen to narrate a capturing story or he can pick up his hammer to carve his masterpiece. Behind every mesmerizing sculpture, there's an untold story. Let's learn about [4 tales behind works of art](https://globitopia.com/works-of-art-sculptures-and-stories/). 

https://preview.redd.it/735q7o6cosi71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9247e4395d9caeee0978a80408ed49f3cf9d694f

***1. Walk through a wall…. But be careful!***

Have you ever sat at a boring dinner and thought about walking through the door? Or have you ever imagined walking through stands to attend matches without waiting in line to get a ticket? Well, it sounds cool and a man has already done it! Well, kind of. 

[Le Passe-Muraille](https://globitopia.com/works-of-art-sculptures-and-stories/#1_Walk_through_a_wall_But_be_careful) (The passer-through-walls in English) is a short story by Marcel Aymé. Aymé wrote a tale about a worker named Dutilleul who discovers that he has a superpower. Dutilleul realizes that he can walk through walls! At first, he uses his power for fun. But then, he becomes a burglar and gets caught. Dutilleul ends up in prison but he manages to escape through walls. One day, Dutilleul was trying to escape through a wall but he gets stuck! This interesting story was behind a statue with the same name in Montmartre, Paris.

If you ever get to see the statue in person, you would notice that his lower hand is a bit shiny. This is because lots of tourists hold that hand and try to put Dutilleul out of his misery. It's also a good photo for Instagram. Sorry, Dutilleul!

***2. The Knotted Gun***

John Lennon was a legendary singer and musician. He was a member of one of the most famous bands of all time, The Beatles. Lennon was also a peace activist who sang about love and called for stopping wars. Unfortunately, Lennon was killed in 1980 in New York City. The news shocked the world. After that event, the Swedish artist Carl Reuterswärd decided to make a sculpture of a gun with a [knotted muzzle ](https://globitopia.com/works-of-art-sculptures-and-stories/#2_The_Knotted_Gun)as a tribute to John Lennon. The Knotted Gun sculpture became a symbol of a foundation called The Non-Violence Project. This organization helped to promote peace. The sculpture is located at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York City. 

***3. Buddha Head in Tree Roots***

Buddhism is a popular faith in many Asian countries. Lots of people follow Buddha's teachings and you can find tons of statues and temples of Buddha all over Asia. However, one sculpture stands out. *Head* to Wat Mahathat temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand and you would find a stone[ Buddha head](https://globitopia.com/works-of-art-sculptures-and-stories/#3_Buddha_Head_in_Tree_Roots) within the roots of a tree! There are many stories behind the unusual site. Some people believe that the tree grew around the head in a time when the temple was abandoned and empty. Others say that some thieves tried to steal the head but it was too heavy so they left it in its current place. There's even a myth that the roots of the tree swallowed the thieves and protected the sculpture.  No matter the reason that led to this unique placement, it's certainly worth the visit. If you ever get the chance to see the famous head, remember to be respectful and don't go too close to the sculpture as it's a sacred site for Buddhists.

***4. Stay quiet! Eriny is sleeping***

There's a sleeping girl guarded by an angel In Alexandria, Egypt. This isn't a fairy tale though. In the 1880s, a girl named Eriny Zurbadaki died at the age of 19. Her parents were affected by that traumatizing event. They refused to accept her sudden death. So, they decided to build two statues above her grave. The first one pictures the sleeping Eriny while the other one shows a [guarding angel](https://globitopia.com/works-of-art-sculptures-and-stories/#4_Stay_quiet_Eriny_is_sleeping) asking visitors not to disturb her.

We should have access to laundry in each unit, or a laundromat close by.  I’ve never packed for a trip like this before so I’m not sure how much of everything to bring.

So thats what we did we rented the van for 3 nights for 457 which was an insane deal considering hotels + car for 3 days is well over a thousand dollars.

So I documented everything into a video that shows you the drop off and pick up process its pretty easy and I think its a great way to explore and save some serious cash.

***Look in the history book***

***Old traces***

Native groups have been living in [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/) for Thousands of years. This includes Atakapan, Athabaskan, and caddoan people. These tribes lived in different parts of Texas. Some groups lived by the Red River while others lived along the Gulf Coast.

***Six flags ….. Six Countries***

In [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/), there's a theme park called ""***Six flags ….. Six Countries"".***

This is also a famous slogan in the state. As six nations had ruled the Region of [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/).

***1. Spain***

In the 16th century, Spain was the first European country to rule [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/). The Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were the first European to land in Texas in 1582. Europeans brought diseases. As a result, many of the indigenous people died.

***2. France***

In 1685, the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier established a French colony in [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/). France's control over the area ended in 1690 when Spain took over again.

***3. Mexico***

***4. The republic of Texas***

Many Texans didn't enjoy life under the Mexican flag. So, they started to fight to get their freedom. They wanted [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/) to be a country by itself.

***6. the Confederate States of America***

In 1861, a civil war started in America. Northern states wanted to end slavery while seven southern states, including Texas, refused that movement.

The United States won the war in 1865 and Texas became an American state again.

Six flags Flew over [Texas](https://globitopia.com/texas-the-lone-star-state/), but only the American flag stood the test of time and stayed high over the southern land.

Hello everyone, because my semester break extends to the beginning of September, I would like to visit the following countries (with the cities Berlin, Warsaw,  Vilnius and Riga from the 18-28 August. 

I myself did an Erasmus exchange in Poland for 5 months, and thus gained some linguistic competence and understanding of the culture. However, as my stay mainly consisted of university projects and Covid restrictions, I decided to explore other parts of Poland. 

I planned all the cities and have never been there except Berlin, so I figured that since these are very well-known cities, it would be worth checking out. 

I would be interested to know what you think is worth seeing, how best to put the trip together, what important information there is.... 

About me: 
I'm 21, Swiss German, like to travel, have an affinity to Asia, like culture, food, language exchange.

What's the first thing that pops in your mind when you think of Japan? Maybe robots or perhaps fast trains. You are right! Japan has all of this but it also has rich history and culture. If you are looking for a journey to the core of Japanese traditions, then you should definitely visit the cultural capital, [Kyoto](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/).

***Pin On the Map***

Japan has around 7000 island, of which only around 430 are inhabited. There are 5 main islands of the country. One of them is Honshu. Honshu has the capital, Tokyo and today's destination, [Kyoto](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/).

***Look in the history book***

***Old Kyoto***

*First traces*

Some experts believe that people started living in [Kyoto ](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)12000 years ago but the first written record of the city dates back to the 6th century. At this time, people built Shimogamo Shrine in the city. It's considered as one of the oldest buildings in the city.

***Becoming the*** **capital**

The year 794 was a great year for [Kyoto](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/). Emperor Kanmu decided to relocate the capital to Kyoto. Kyoto remained the Japan's capital for centuries till 1868 when Tokyo took that title.

***Ups and down***

**From 1467 till 1477**, there was a civil war in Japan. It was called The Ōnin War. Many of [Kyoto's ](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)buildings and streets were destroyed during that war.

In the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was an important Japanese politician. He helped in the reconstruction of the city's buildings and streets. He also gathered many of the temples in one street called Teramachi Street.

***Modern Kyoto***

In 1864, there was a revolution. People burned around 30000 houses of Old [Kyoto](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/).

In 1890, Lake Biwa Canal was constructed. This important waterway started a new chapter in [Kyoto's ](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)story and revived the city.

***Tour in the city***

***Shimogamo Shrine***

This magnificent shrine overlooks Takano and Kamo rivers. It's also surrounded by Tadasu no Mori forest. It's considered one of the most visited shrines of Shinto religion. In 1994, UNESCO announced that the site has become one of the World Heritage sites.

***Kamigamo Shrine***

Just around 3 kilometers away from Shimogamo Shrine, Kamigamo Shrine has also been named World Heritage site in 1994. The site is famous for its two sand cones that sit by the entrance.

***The Kyoto Imperial Palace***

Until 1868, Japanese emperors lived in that place. Over the centuries, the palace was destroyed and burnt several times. The current palace was reconstructed in 1855. The palace stands tall in [Kyoto ](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)Imperial Park which is located in the city center.

***Take a bite***

For centuries, [Kyoto ](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)has been the emperor's home. This brought the best foods to the old city.

To many locals, ""youdofu"" is considered the signature dish of the city. It consists of tofu, water, kelp. Chefs put the kelp on the bottom of the pot. Then, they add tofu and water. After that, the mixture is heated. When it's ready, you can eat it with a dipping sauce. One of the most famous sauces in [Kyoto ](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)is called ""Ponzu"" which is made of soy.

***Fun fact about the city***

The original name of ""Kyoto"" was ""Heian-kyō"" which means the city of the capital of peace. Then the name was changed to ""[Kyoto](https://globitopia.com/kyoto-the-former-capital-of-japan/)"" which means ""the capital city""!

Koalas and Kangaroos, Crocodiles and cockatoos. Australia has all of this and much more. Keep reading to learn more about Australia's facts and secrets.

***Wave The flag***

Britain affected Australia over the years. The British impact can be seen even on the Australian flag. On the left of the flag, you can see the British union flag. There is also a constellation called the Southern Cross. The constellation is a group of stars that form a picture in the sky. The Southern Cross can only be seen from the bottom half of the world! Under the British flag, there is a big star with seven points. These points represent the current six states of Australia and the seventh point is a symbol of future states of the country.

***Sing along***

Austrians are known to be happy. It's even written in the first line of their national anthem, ""Australians all let us rejoice….."".

The Australian's national tune is called ""Advance Australia Fair."" Peter Dodds McCormick wrote and composed the anthem in 1878. Since that time, the song was modified many times. The last change happened in 2021 when the beginning changed from “Australians all let us rejoice/For we are young and free,” to ""For we are *one* and free”. This adjustment was made to recognize the history of the native groups.

***Listen to the anthem***

***Pin on the map***

[Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) is one of the seven continents of the Earth. It's also an island, (although some experts believe that a continent can't be an island at the same time, Sorry Aussies). The big country lies south of the equator. That's why it's called ""The land down under.""

[Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)covers 7.692 million km² making it the sixth-largest country in the world. It lies on the Pacific and Indian oceans. The nation doesn't share land borders with any other country. However, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand are [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)'s closest neighbors.

Most of [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)'s lands is flat. The peak of Mount Kosciuszko is the highest point in the country at is 2228m (7309 ft).

Uluru isn't the tallest landmark in the nation but it's definitely one of the most popular. The famous site is visited by thousands of tourists every year it is considered sacred to the native groups. Some experts believe that this huge sandstone started to form around 550 million years ago!

***Flora and Fauna***

Most of the wildlife in [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) can't be found anywhere else in the world. [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) has a lot of endemic species. Those are the creatures that only exist in one region. The continent is home to around 3,000 endemic animals. This includes Koalas, kangaroos and Wombats. Besides, Australia has 18,000 endemic plant species, such as eremophila and melaleuca.

***Look In The History Book***

***First traces***

In contrast to what many believe, [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) isn't a younger country. Native groups have been living in the area for thousands of years. These groups are also called Aboriginal people. They first emigrated from south East Asia. A new study showed that the first groups arrived in [Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)more than 60.000 years ago! At one point, the population of the native groups in Australia may have reached around 1 million people!

***The arrival of the Europeans***

In the 17th century, the Dutch were the first Europeans to reach [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) by a ship called Duyfken. They named the area ""New Holland."" However, The Dutch didn't build any settlements in [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/). This changed on 1788 when the British arrived.

***New British Prison***

Let's rewind a little, shall we? Britain lost control of its colonies in America in 1783. So, it needed a new ***Penal*** colony. A penal colony is a place where The British used to send criminals. Britain decided to send the convicts to [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/). They first started building one prison. Soon, the whole continent turned into a British colony. Over 150.000 prisoners were sent to [Australia ](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/)in the next 80 years.

***Hard times***

The native groups were deeply affected by the British control. Thousands of the Aboriginal people were killed in battles with the Brits called ""Frontier Wars."" The British also brought deadly diseases that nearly wiped out the entire population of native groups.

***Gold and Freedom***

In the mid of the 1800s, the British government spared the news that gold had been found in Australian lands. As a result, large groups of workers from China, North America and Europe moved to [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/). These ""free"" settlers changed [Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/). They didn't like how the British ruled the area and soon started the Eureka Rebellion. This event began the movement for independency. Finally, Australia became independent in the 1900s.

***Modern era***

[Australia](https://globitopia.com/australia-facts/) is still part of the commonwealth nations. This means that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of the state and her face appears on the country's money (the Australian Dollar) but she doesn't have a real authority in the country.

Australian cities hosted the summer Olympics twice. The first one was in 1956 in Melbourne and the second one was in Sydney in 2000.

***Take a walk***

***Sydney***

TravelHacks,"Alright! So I have spent countless hours trying to figure this out and only now found this subreddit so here we go:

For my honeymoon my fiancé and I want to fly business class from NYC to Japan (preferably Tokyo but open to other cities if cheaper). We are not wealthy by any means so I’ve been working on getting points together for this. I now have 110,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points and 100,000 Skymiles. I’ve thought of a million different transfer scenarios for the points but keep running into brick walls. Im open to buying some extra points if I have to, but ran into an issue with that on Virgin Atlantic as well (you need to buy a flight with them before buying more points). I’ve even considered using “consolidators” or “mileage brokers” but feel like it’s too scammy.

TravelHacks,"Long story that's optional to read:

I'm 20 years old right now, and lest year in November I was playing games with my friends and they introduced me to this friend of theirs, one of which had known her for about 7 years on and off. We all added each other on Snapchat, and the more we talked as a group, the more her and I connected, and dropped some not so subtle hints until we both confessed we have feelings for each other. It's gonna be close to a year now, and I am in love with this woman. We talk everyday whenever we can, face timing, watching movies, and playing games together. We haven't made things official because we both agree it would be better to spend face to face time together first. Mostly to avoid the label/stereotype of ""you fell in love with someone online you've never met before"".

So, here's my issue. I want to plan a trip to go and meet her, and probably stay around two weeks. We're both young still which = not a lot of money and all the plane ticket prices I'm finding are ridiculous. It's out of the question for her to buy one, because from what we've seen it would cost her like 3 times as much for the same distance/amount of time. Does anyone have tips on finding cheaper flights? I don't really care what class it is or how many connecting flights there are, I just want to make it happen with the least amount of damage to my bank account.

5,000 years of civilization, a great wall of wonders, tales of legendary dragons, fluffy pandas and global economic dominance. You can find all of this and much more in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Keep reading to learn more about China facts and secrets.

***Wave The Flag***

The Chinese flag has a red background with five golden stars in the upper left corner. Red stands for the blood of the Chinese and it’s also the main color of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); often worn at weddings and festivals for good luck. The large star is for the Chinese communist party, the smaller stars represent the different groups in the country.

All the five stars united together to defeat [Japan](https://globitopia.com/japan-facts/) in WWII. “Zeng Liansong” designed the current flag when the communist government started a new flag designing competition in 1949. He said he was inspired by the Soviet flag.

***Sing Along***

The national anthem of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is called “The March of the Volunteers”. In 1935, the anthem was written by “Tian Han” and composed by “Nie Er” who both took part in the resistance to the Japanese invasion. It was written in the Vernacular –the public language- rather than the classical Chinese to reach a larger audience and encourage the Chinese people to resist the Japanese invaders.

***Pin on the Map***

China lies in south-east Asia facing the Pacific Ocean, [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)shares borders with 14 countries; the summit of Mount Everest of the Himalayas is a border-line between China and Nepal.

The summit of Mount Everest is a boarder-line between [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)and Nepal

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)is the 4th largest country in the world and the second-biggest nation in Asia after Russia.

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)has over 1.500 flowing rivers; the main rivers are the Yellow River in the north and the Yangtze River in the south. Both rivers originate from the Tibetan plateau.

***Flora and Fauna***

The pure water of China’s rivers has a great impact on the diversity of the Chinese wildlife with over 30,000 plant species such as [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)Fir, Yunnan Cypress, The happy tree and Bamboo.

The Chinese used the native plants in cooking, medical potions and offerings to God as Buddhists believe that those plants are holy. The plants provide home and food for over 4,400 animal species such as pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, Chinese pheasant and Bactrian camel.

***Look at the History Book***

***The First Dynasty***

Thousands of years ago, the yellow river flooded every year and destroyed crops of rice and silk. That changed when an engineer, called “Yu”, spent 13 years digging canals and waterways that redirected the floods into new fields. “Yu” saved the farmers’ lives, so he was named king and his family started the very first Dynasty of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/): The “Xia” Dynasty.

***The First United Chinese Empire*** All the following dynasties were small, separated by rivers, and rapidly fell apart. By 221 BCE, “Qin Shi Huang” became the first emperor to unite most of [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)under the rule of the “Qin” Dynasty. He set laws and had a governmental system of ministries. The Qin Empire is pronounced “CH-in”. This unified empire gave birth to today’s “CH-IN-A”.

***The Story Behind The Wall*** Emperor “Qin” saw the Pacific Ocean and the Tibetan plateau as natural defenses. He started building a barrier against the Turkish, the Mongols and the Xiongnu in the north. He called it the long wall.

In the 13th century, the Mongols breached the long wall under the leadership of “Genghis Khan”. In 1368, “Zhu Yuan Zhang” defeated the Mongols and took over [China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)again starting the “Ming” Dynasty. He continued building the wall. Watchtowers started to use fire and smoke signals in case of raiders.

The great wall came into use in WWII. China used the Wall to stop the Japanese from going north.

***Modern Era*** From 1927 to 1949, a civil war erupted in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). The communist party won the war. On October 1st, 1949, the first communist leader “Mao Zedong” declared the People’s Republic of China: the current political status in China. Today, October 1st is the national day of China.

“Mao Zedong” is the man on the “Chinese yuan”; the official currency of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); one yuan equals 0.15 US dollars.

[China ](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/)hosted the 2008 summer Olympics &amp; Paralympics in the capital Beijing. The spectacular opening ceremony had 2,008 drummers played the bronze Fou drums singing: “Isn’t it delightful to have friends coming from afar?” which is a poem by the Chinese philosopher “Confucius”.

***Take A Walk***

***Beijing*** It’s the capital and the most visited city in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Beijing is the meeting point of ancient culture and modern Chinese arts.

***The Great Wall of China*** It’s one of the biggest man-made structures on earth with 21,196 Km in length. The highest place in the wall reaches 14 meters.

As a UNESCO world heritage site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World, you can’t miss having a photograph next to history; it’s a breathtaking experience to watch the sunrise from the wall as the sun casts light on the beautiful nature. Just head to the Badaling Pass north of Beijing as organized tours and public transports are available for you.

***The Forbidden City or The Imperial Palace*** In the heart of Beijing, This UNESCO world heritage palace was home to emperors of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

It covers 720,000 square kilometers and is guarded by a 10-meter wall.

Emperor “Chengzu” of the Ming Dynasty built the palace with 9,999 rooms; He said that only the God of heaven can have 10,000 rooms!

The once forbidden to the public is now an open museum with over 50,000 Chinese art pieces for you to enjoy along with the 3 main halls in the palace; the Hall of Preserving Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony and the Hall of Supreme Harmony.

***Beijing Zoo &amp; Aquarium***

It’s time to meet new friends only found in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Your first destination would be The Panda Hall as it’s hard to find pandas at any other zoo around the Globe. Not restricted to native Chinese animals; The Beijing zoo has over 5,000 different animals from all around the world like the American Bison and the Australian Kangaroo. Tickets are free if you’re under 1.2 meters tall, you can even rent a sightseeing car around the zoo for a little extra money.

Now let’s stop by the largest artificial aquarium in the world, you can spot all kinds of marine life like man-eating fish, Chinese sturgeons, sea elephants and even scary sharks.

Enjoy shows performed by dolphins, sea lions &amp; whales in the aquarium theatre.

***Beijing 798 Art Zone*** It’s an open gallery of street arts, hip sculptures, and unusual yet exciting artwork.

This place was a compound of military factories that made destructive weapons in WWII. Now it’s a home for promising young Chinese artists whose crafts can revive the mind and soul.

***The Terracotta Army*** In 1970 in Xi’an city, an underground discovery of 8,000 statues of man-sized warriors, 520 horses, and 100 chariots were found guarding the tomb of “Qin Shi Huang” the first emperor of [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/). Scientists say those clay statues were made around 248 BCE. It’s a mesmerizing UNESCO world heritage site.

***The Chinese Pyramids*** Emperor’s “Qin” tomb isn’t the only burial place in Xi’an city. The city was considered sacred to the ancient Chinese. They called it “eternal peace” and built several Pyramids in Xi’an to house the emperors’ bodies in their journey to eternal peace. The Chinese Pyramids pretty much resemble the Egyptian Pyramids in keeping the bodies safe for the afterlife. So, you don’t have to visit [Egypt](https://globitopia.com/egypt-facts/) to see a Pyramid!

***The Three Gorges of the Yangtze River*** It’s the biggest hydroelectric power-producing dam in the world. The former president “Sun Yat-sen” in 1919 thought of building a power source on the Yangtze. However, the project was opened in 2003!

The best way to the gorges is by a relaxing Yangtze River cruise. On reaching the three gorges, you’ll find available buses, escalators, and guides to take you around one of the greatest engineering buildings ever made.

***Leshan Giant Buddha / Mount Emei*** A 71-meter tall statue was carved in the stones of Mount Emei by orders of the Buddhist monk “Hai Tong” who was worried about the safety of the poor fishermen whose boats crashed due to the turbulence of the three rivers: Min, Qingyi, and Dadu Rivers.

The statue was built overlooking the meeting point of the three rivers to watch over the water and keep the people safe. The Leshan Buddha is the largest Buddha sculpture in the world.

With many Buddhist temples in the mountain, Mount Emei is considered a Buddhist holy site and a UNESCO world heritage site.

Plan on visiting the temples around and enjoy the landscape of the Qingying Pavilion, or start a hiking trip to the golden summit of the mountain. If your feet hurt, you can take cable cars on your way up.

***Zhangjiajie Forest National Park – Hunan*** In 2009, The movie director James Cameron shot his record-breaking “Avatar” in the Hallelujah mountains of the Zhangjiajie Forest. Since then, People call the famous site the “Avatar mountains”.

the Hallelujah mountain of the Zhangjiajie Forest

The park is a jaw-dropping greenery place with beautiful lakes, a huge dam, and a Chinese ethnic tribe with unusual traditions. For example, the bride must cry for 3 days before her wedding, the longer she cries the more beautiful of a wife she gets.

***Shanghai Markets*** It’s about time to go shopping. In Shanghai, there’s a market for everything and everyone with a very reasonable price.

It’s a wonderful day for treasure hunting in the “City God Temple Market” which is full of Chinese antiques like the Chinese teapot and cups which are called the Gaiwan. It’s the perfect place for souvenirs and gifts.

Do you want to look fabulous for much less money? The “Qipu Road Clothing Market” is the place for you with good deals on the latest fashion trends.

Looking for some quality fabrics or a fully customized suit made especially for you? Pay the “Bund Fabric Market” a visit, don’t forget to haggle; you can save half of the asked price.

***Meet The People***

China has the highest population in the world with 1.4 billion people. However, China is a major economic powerhouse. [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/) has a constant improvement in the employment structure despite the huge number of people living there. New jobs are popping every day as a result of the evolving economy. In 2015, China announced that it has more than 526 different jobs with nearly none underemployed.

There’s an old saying referring to [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/): “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes up, he will shake the world.” We guess this prophecy came true with the Chinese economy.

There are 302 different languages in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); the most common is the standard Chinese also known as “Mandarin”. Other languages are found only in particular territories like the “Wu” which is spoken only in Shanghai.

***Mark Your Calendar***

The Chinese New Year or The Lunar New Year usually starts between January 21 and February 20.

For this holiday, The Chinese decorate the streets with red lanterns and ribbons. Kids are given money in red envelopes. Feasts and celebrations last for 15 days. The lunar New Year is marked by a dragon dance and a huge parade. The legend says that around every new lunar year, a vicious dragon attacked the villagers but the ancestors used the red decorations to scare the beast away.

The Chinese usually wear traditional clothes at their festivals such as the “Tang Suit” for men and the “Qipao” for women.

The “Guoyue” music is often played at festivals and around markets. It’s the national music in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/); it’s easy for your ears to recognize the Chinese music with the high pitched notes and the stringy instruments like the Guzheng, the Pipa and the Yangqin.

***Take a bite***

Bring your chopsticks and join our feast of Chinese food, It’s heart-whelming to the exten that it’s now eaten in every country all around the world.

Could you please set your fork and knife aside for now? The knife and fork stand for violence and fights in [China](https://globitopia.com/china-facts/), unlike the chopsticks that stand for gentleness and passion.

***Noodles*** A worldwide famous Chinese dish. Noodles are starchy dough that’s shaped into spiral strings. Archaeologists found a 4,000-year-old bowl of noodles reserved underground in the Lajia archaeological site. There’s also an ancient book that described the Han Dynasty and mentioned the Noodles dish.

***Dim Sum*** Small bite-sized squishy stuffed dough with meat, or veggies. It can be fried, steamed or dropped in broth. It’s believed that Dim Sums go back to 2,500 years ago; as the ancestors glorified them in an ancient Chinese poem.

***Spring Rolls*** A traditional Chinese snack of pastry filled with cabbage, shredded veggies and sometimes you can add pork or meat.

Spring Rolls go back to the Jin Dynasty as the ancestors ate them at the beginning of the spring, and called them the “dish of Spring”.

***Tofu*** It’s believed that Prince “*Liú Ān*” of the Han Dynasty invented Tofu to help feed his toothless grandmother.

Another story goes with a cook who accidentally applied the cheese-making methods to soy milk. Anyway, it’s a delicious nutritious soybean curd that’s so easy to devour.

***Fun Fact***

***Dance On Water*** The young dancer “Yang Liu” has practiced the Chinese “Duzhu Drifting” since she was 7 years old to keep the tradition alive. She performs the Chinese dance on a floating bamboo stick with the whole river as her stage. This tradition started thousands of years ago in the Chishui River as a method for transporting wood to the capital by water. The Duzhu Drifting requires skill, flexibility, practice, and balance.

However I'm finding it hard to see how much this would be in each country. If it was free emergency medical care for covid ect or an emergency, you could travel without insurance as the insurance would cover hotels not used or flights ect which would cost excess and I would do anyway, only thing travel insurance cost is being brought home in a medical emergency.

Scientists usually call Africa the ""birthplace of the human race"". As they believe that humans evolved around 200,000 years ago in that continent before spreading all over the world. Let's learn more about Africa Facts and secrets.

***On The Land***

Africa is the second-largest continent in the world After Asia. Most of the African countries lie in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. The continent has 54 countries and 9 dependent territories. Algeria is the largest country in Africa by area as it covers 2,381,741 square kilometers (919,595 sq mi) making it the 10th largest country in the world. Seychelles is the smallest country in [Africa ](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/)as it only covers 455 sq km (176 sq miles).

***Map of Africa***

[Africa ](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/)has many rivers. That includes The Niger, The Congo and The Zambezi rivers. However, The Nile is the most famous river in the continent. It is the longest river in the world. The Nile flows for around 6,650 km. The Nile has two major tributaries, the Blue Nile (which begins at Lake Victoria) and the White Nile (which begins at Lake Tana). Both tributaries meet just north of Khartoum (the capital of Sudan). The Nile's journey passes through 11 countries and ends in the Mediterranean Sea north of Egypt.

Africa has plains, forests, deserts, lakes, mountains and even volcanoes. The Atlas Mountains is the longest unbroken mountain range in [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/). It stretches across northwestern Africa. However, the highest peak in the continent lies in The East African Mountains. It's called Mount Kilimanjaro which reaches a height of 5,895 meters (19,341 ft) above sea level. Africa is also home to the largest hot desert in the world. The Sahara covers an area of 9,200,000 square kilometers (3,600,000 sq mi).

Around a quarter of [Africa ](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/)is covered by rainforests. That includes Congo forest, Mau forest, Ongoye Forest and Arabuko Sokoke forest. Congo forest is the largest rainforest in Africa the second-largest tropical rainforest in the world after the Amazon in South America. This massive land covers parts of six African countries. However, the size of forests is shrinking in Africa due to urbanization.

Africa is known for its richness in wildlife. The huge continent is home to thousands of different species. This made [Africa ](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/)a favorite destination for animal researchers and lovers. Every year, people flock to Africa to visit the national parks, reserves and sanctuaries. The most famous animals in the continent are called the ""big five"" which are the buffalos, lions, elephants, leopards and rhinoceros. All of these animals live in Southern Africa. Many other animals that live in Africa, such as giraffes, zebras, ostriches and cheetahs.

Africa's weather is different from one place to another. In North [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/), the climate is dry and hot. Rain doesn't often fall in the deserts there. (However, the temperatures can go drop below freezing in the Sahara desert and the mountains at night).

In West and Central [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/), the climate is hot and humid with heavy seasonal rains. In East Africa, the seasons are either dry or rainy while the climate in Southern Africa is mostly moderate.

In many African countries, there aren't four seasons like Europe and the US. Most countries that lie south of the Sahara Desert have two seasons, the dry and the rainy seasons.

[Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) faces many threats. Some of these hazards are natural such as droughts, floods, storms and earthquakes. While others are made by humans. These include pollution, losses to livelihoods and property. The continent is deeply affected by epidemics and diseases. Cholera, malaria and Ebola were among the most famous outbreaks in the continent.

***Meet the people***

Africa is the second-most-populous continent in the world with more than 1.3 billion people. Nigeria is the most inhabited nation in [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) with more than 206 million people living there.

Africa is a pot of cultures. The continent has more than 3000 different groups. These groups speak more than 2,100 different languages and practice tons of religions. Yoruba is the biggest ethnic group in the continent with more than 35 million people living mainly in three countries, which are Nigeria, Benin, and Togo. Arabic and Swahili are among the most popular languages in the continent. Arabic dominates North [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) while Swahili is mainly spoken in East Africa. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Europeans colonized most countries in Africa. As a result, European languages, such as French and English are spoken as a second language in many African nations.

The colonization, civil wars and droughts had great impacts on many African nations. That's why many of the world's poorest nations are in [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/). Somalia and Burundi are among the poorest African nations. On the other hand, there are some rich and fast-growing economies in the continent. This includes South Africa, Nigeria and Egypt.

Sports are very important in Africa. Football is, without doubt, the most practiced and watched sport in the continent. Egypt holds the record in winning the African Cup of Nations. The pharaohs won the title seven times. South [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) was the only African country to host the World Cup. That happened in 2010. African National football teams have left their marks in World Cup. However, they haven't been able to reach the semi-finals. Maybe their luck would change in 2022 in Qatar. Who knows?

Music is very important in [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/). There are different styles of music in each country. In many African countries, music is often used in religious rituals. Songs are told and passed down from generation to generation and dances are performed to express joy or even sadness! The xylophone and drums are among the most used musical instruments especially in West and East Africa. Fela Kuti was one of the most influential musicians in modern history. The Nigerian artist made songs opposing the dictators in his country.

***Take a walk***

[Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) is full of attractions. From stunning safaris to massive monuments, there's something for everyone in ""the motherland"".

***Parks***

[Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) has an array of landscapes and reserves that attract wildlife lovers from all around the globe. It might be difficult to choose from. Here are some parks you shouldn't miss.

***Hwange National Park***

Some people like to call this startling park ""Home of Elephants"". A huge population of the big-tusked creatures lives there. We recommend visiting the park between August and October. In this dry season, elephants are gathered around the water holes so you might find them easily.

Not only elephants live there. Hwange National Park is a haven for wild dogs, leopards, cheetahs and many other beasts.

***Serengeti National Park, Tanzania***

If you love movies about animals, you must have seen Serengeti National Park at least once. The famous area was featured in many films and documentaries. This is not a surprise though. The site is famous for the Great Migration. Every year, millions of animals travel from Serengeti to Kenya. Thousands of tourists visit the park to witness this breathtaking scene.

***Namib-Naukluft National Park, Namibia***

Do you like deserts? If so, we have the perfect place for you. Namib-Naukluft National Park has tons of sand as it is the fourth largest national park in the world and home to one of the oldest deserts on the planet, the Namib Desert. The place is home to many wild animals. That includes leopards, springboks, giraffes and black-backed jackals. If you like to experience absolute silence among waves of dunes, then you should head straight to Namibia. We can promise lots of ""me time"" there.

***Man-made wonders***

Africa isn't all about animals and deserts. People in [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/) built outstanding structures. Here are some man-made sites you should consider visiting.

***The Egyptian pyramids***

Obvious choice, isn't it? The famous pyramids are among the most famous monuments in the whole world, not just in [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/). The huge structures are called Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure and they are guarded by the sphinx. The sphinx is a massive statue with the head of a human and the body of a lion. The Pyramids at Giza are around 4500 years old! People from all over the world come and watch in awe this magnificent site.

***Kano City Wall***

The British described the Kano city wall as ""the most impressive monument in West Africa"". The wall was built to protect the city of Kano, Nigeria in between 1095 and 1134. The wall is around 15 m high. UNESCO added the site to the world Heritage sites list due to its historical significance. However, only twenty per cent of the wall is still intact as major parts were damaged due to the need for building materials. The remains of the wall show the architectural wonders of West [Africa](https://globitopia.com/africa-facts/).

***Chefchaouen, Morocco***

Let's head back north to visit Chefchaouen in Morocco. The wondrous city is famous for its blue buildings. That's why it was called ""the blue pearl."" Chefchaouen was founded in the 15th century as a fortress. However, the famous blue color only came to the city in the 20th century. But why? There are a lot of stories behind the blue secret. Some people believe the city was painted blue as this color keeps mosquitos away while others believe it was a step to attract tourists. Some historians believe that Jewish communities that fled to Morocco during WW II painted many buildings in blue as this color symbolizes the sky which is a reminder of heaven and God. No matter the reason, ""the blue pearl"" would keep its distinguished color for many years to come.

***Fun fact***

***Zambian Astronauts!!***

When you think of space programs, you might think of The US, Russia or even China. But did you know that in the 1960s, the African Nation, Zambia, was thinking about sending astronauts and a cat to Mars? Unfortunately, the program failed. Who knows? We might see an African country landing on the moon or Mars in the future!","Heading towards Africa? - An Overview Of The ""motherland""",,Globitopia,,0,2021-08-09 08:37:22

TravelHacks,"So we booked a trip to Hawaii on Southwest and had to book two separate legs since there are  no direct flights from our home. We land at OAK at 10am and our flight to HI doesn't leave until 6pm.  We planned on hanging out at the Escape Lounge most of the day but now realizing I may have a problem with my luggage. Because I booked two separate legs, I will have to pick up our luggage in the morning, but per Southwest's website, we can't check our bags for the next flight any earlier than 4 hours. ie around 2:00PM.  Since baggage is outside of security and the Escape Lounge is in the terminal, I am trying to figure out what to do with our bags while we wait to check in for the 2nd flight.

Since we're on SW we will have mobile boarding passes for the 2nd flight already but wondering if we can bring our luggage through security for a few hours and just head out front to check the bags closer to 6pm. OAK apparently has no storage lockers and I am thinking it's not a good idea to leave the bags in baggage claim unattended",8 Hour Delay at OAK - Baggage ?,,filthymitten,,5,2021-08-04 12:30:48
