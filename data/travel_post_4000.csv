travel,"Not sure if best forum to ask, but here goes‚Ä¶. My Corp is sending me &amp; a +1 to an all-inclusive resort in MX in May for 3 nights as part of an awards thing, (list has ~175 ppl on it, figure 3/4 of them attend, plus some bigwigs, and roughly 1/2 of the resort taken over for the event). 

From day one of online registration we‚Äôd attend, (one month ago), I emailed the TA they‚Äôre using requesting room upgrades. After 12 days and a second email with no response I called. Said she was on it. 9 more days later, (and two more emails), I finally heard back &amp; authorized a Suite upgrade that‚Äôd result in ~$3.3k OOP for us, (still over half off public rates, all good). 

I reiterated our interest in a further upgrade, via cash or points (as it‚Äôs a chain I‚Äôve got plenty to spare), but understood higher categories weren‚Äôt in their contract, it‚Äôd be noted and who knows. Cool. But it‚Äôs been another 10 days, still no call for my CC info to pay the initial upgrade, despite more two emails over that time. 

I get she‚Äôs likely juggling a lot. But this is huge $ to us, and simply want to pay &amp; confirm we get what we want. And it‚Äôs only ~5 weeks away now. (The different TA they use for flights did our seat upgrades next day, ugh). 

How do I continue to push her to confirm &amp; take our $, while still being respectful of what she‚Äôs handling? I get my Corp is the client, but once I‚Äôm paying, I feel I am too. It‚Äôs been just under a month now, I‚Äôve never not had my ducks lined up so close to a major trip, (usually do our own thing, but even the two times I used a TA). How do I address this? There‚Äôs a lot on our plate for this trip, (putting an elderly parent we care for in an SNF for Alz, pet boarding, etc).

travel,"I wanted to ask to see if people have had similar experiences and how they felt about it? 

Basically I'm solo travelling in Australia. Driving around, free camping when I can etc and doing all there is to do as I go. 

I joined a ride shares and convoy traveller fb group to meet some like minded goers. I saw someone advertise they were looking for a ride from A to B, which happened to where I was headed, so I offered them to join! I did add that I wanted to stay the night en route and do a hike that I'd read about so if they didn't want to do that no worries we'll give it a miss. But no, they replied they thought that was a great idea, they'd love to come and they were really excited. Great! 

We get on the road! In total the drive was 12 hours and the stop off point was more or less half way through. At first I was thinking this is great to have some company and they seem easy going and not crazy so ideal! But after a while I found that I was the only one making conversation, not that we needed to speak every minute, but hey were having this brilliant experience exploring another country; having some time to chew the fat and get to know another person could be a fun experience. Plus, we had time to kill! But nevertheless they remained very quiet. 

I obviously consider that I am not an infallible human and maybe they thought they didn't like me too much or something? However, there was only chit chat about their studies and where we were from etc so there's not much I could have said that would have created a negative environment, objectively speaking. 

Anyway so we went through the whole journey barely talking because I eventually felt I'd annoy them if I kept making conversation. When we were setting off to do the hike I said if they didn't want to do it that was fine because they really didn't seem too interested! But they insisted they wanted to, so we hiked, in silence, for a day.  I decided that I would be myself so if I had something to say, I said it, but I didn't go out of my way to strike up a chat because they gave one word answers and seemed completely disinterested. 

I ended up looking forward to the end of that trip and parting ways. I felt I could've had more of a laugh by myself. 

We parted with no hostility. I'm not saying I expect to find a best pal on the off chance but what's the harm in some light hearted chat if you decide to travel with someone in a beautiful environment with no work or usual daily struggles to consider. 

I'm not sure I understand why someone would embark on a social rideshare if they were not interested with interacting. We met other people on the way and said person also did not interact with them either.

travel,"Hello,

My girlfriend and I are landing in Korea on May 9, landing in Osaka on May 15, and departing back home from Tokyo on May 29th. Apart from that, we know nothing about Asia aside from the basic research we have begun. I know that people take bullet trains to visit a lot of other cities and rural areas, and booking hotel accommodation is much cheaper on domestic websites.  


Aside from that, I want to book hotels soon rather than waiting for the last second when they will become much more expensive. Though to book hotels, I'm not even sure how we're going to distribute our trips across different cities, and it's gonna take a while to do enough research to plan that itinerary and then book hotels.  


So what do you guys think? What cities should we travel to and how many days should we do in each city? A rough thought was like 2 or 3 days in Osaka, 2 days in Kyoto, and the rest in Tokyo, but I heard there are even other cool cities. We're trying to find a cool mixed-gender hot spring / onsen too.

Dear Redditors,

I'll be flying to Vietnam via Singapore next week with Singapore Airlines next week. As I've been preparing for my trip I've noticed a small defect in my passport. 

The damage isn't really visible, but the data page is kind of detaching from it's binding in the corner (around 1,5cm, marked with a blue circle in the picture). The passport is 9 years old and has been heavily used so I guess it must be due to immigration agents swiping the MRZ in their scanners.

Unfortunately I'm not able to get it replaced as it takes around 1 month in Poland where I'm from

As the tear isn't really visible I'm hoping to not experience any problems, but I can't stop overthinking an am looking for some peace of mind (although it might also backfire I guess).

So here's the question: what are my chances to being denied boarding/entry to a country with this kind of defect in the ID page?

Day 4: Chianti Wineries Tour (Wine Tasting, because I want to feel bougie haha)

**Milan - **

(Oh geez, things are getting tricky here. I need more things to do in Milan it looks like. I should have gone to Venice but the low canals this year made me not want to go. I already booked my AirBNBs and my plane leaves in Milan. So I guess it *might* be too late to switch things up.)

* Jiufen - I've read that this isn't good for elderly, so I'm a little hesitant about this.
* Yangmingshan Park area - I guess it's mostly hiking and might not be good for my elderly parents? Also, I'm worried we might not appreciate it without a guide or something. 

I also considered those free walking tours, but they last for 2.5-3 hours. If it's too warm and sunny in Taipei next week, it's also not a good option for my parents (one has hypertension).

* It's my family's first time traveling abroad.
* My siblings just want something chill, and they don't want the itinerary to be jam-packed.
* I just want an activity we could do before we go to any of the night markets. (We need to go back to the hotel early because our flight is late at night.)

travel," Hi everyone,

I found some cheap ticket from LGW to Geneva for 60 quid so did some quick research and made up a itinerary for this upcoming long weekend. I have checked all the transport from Geneva all the way back to Newhaven and it seems feasible, at least for me. The reason I did not buy an return ticket from Genvea is because the ticket would cost 300-400 pound which would be too expensive for me. It's my first time going to Switzerland. Let me know your thoughts on my itinerary and I am open to any suggestions!

**Day 1: Arrive Geneva at 9am**

Place du Bourg-de-Four

Cath√©drale Saint-Pierre Gen√®ve Cr de Saint-Pierre, 1204 Gen√®ve

The Geneva Water Fountain Quai Gustave-Ador, 1207 Gen√®ve

Supermarket Lunch / Cook in hostel

Viaduc de la Jonction Chem. William-Lescaze 29, 1203 Gen√®ve

Plaine de Plainpalais

**Day 2: Geneva to Annecy/Lyon**

Walk around Annecy and take train back to Lyon for hostel (reason: 30min away from station)

**Day 3: Lyon to Dieppe**

Take 7am train from Lyon to Paris reach at 9:04am

Walk around Paris. I have visited last October so I am pretty comfortable here.

Buy tradition and comte and sit at a park

Take train to LaDefense (at 2pm)

Take bus from LaDefense to Dieppe (2:45pm - 5:30pm)

Book an Airbnb next to the ferry

travel,"We will be staying in G√ºndlischwand. Not interested in seeing jungfrauch or schilthorn. Going with family, and concern that it will be too much walk for my dad. he is in his 60s. Main things we will do are:

\- Day 1:  Walking/rent an eletric bike in Lautrebrunnen. Visit Staubbach falls. 

\- Day 2: Visiting Murren / Gimmewald / Wengen

\- Day 3: Visiting Grindewald, Grindewald First and lake balchapsee

We really want to see Manlichen, Schynige Platte  and Almendhubel, but realized the cable car going there will be close during our trip :-( Thats why not sure if buying Jungfrauch travel pass is a good idea.

However if I do end up buying it, I'm going to add a lake brienz boat trip, Kleine scheidegg and Harder Kulm in the trip. 

After calculating with above potential itinerary, using a car would be \~$150 cheaper which can be used either for eating out or renting a bike. And, we wouldn't have to carry the luggage for 15 min from  Zweil√ºtschinen train station.

But what I don't want to miss is the view from Lucern to Interlaken. I'm not sure if the view from the car would be similar with the train's view.

travel,"I made two hotel reservations for a trip, one directly and one via Priceline, both offering generous free cancellation policies.  I decided later to cancel the Priceline booking and keep the direct one. I have the email from Priceline stating the cancellation has been processed.

What I did not notice is that the hotel that charged my card directly was the one I booked via Priceline. I had thought it was the direct booking. They are both the same brand, and it's not clear from the subject line which hotel it is.

So checkout comes, I look at the folio, and I don't see any credit from a deposit. After checking my hotel and calling the other one, I learn that the deposit was for the other hotel, and their records do not show the room as cancelled. And because of that I never received a refund.

Whether it's a fault on Priceline not sending the cancellation or the hotel not processing it, I'll probably never know. Regardless, through no fault of my own, I am now missing a large chunk of money that I would very much like to have back. I have spoke to both the hotel and Priceline, and they also spoke with each other. They are supposedly going to be working out whose fault it is to refund me.

What I want to know is, what other steps can or should I be taking to protect myself and to receive my money?

I already contacted my credit card to see what my options are there, but will need to speak with the disputes department on Monday.

This July, I'm landing in Incheon International at 4:40pm on a Monday and will be departing before 8am. I hope to see as much of Korea as I possibly can with the little time that I have.

1) Leave to Seoul ASAP and check out either of the following areas---&gt; Cheonggyecheon Stream, Hongdae, Myeondong.  

2) take the last train back at midnight and explore Incheon  - *eg. paradise city? don't know where else*

My plan is:
Day 1: Visit Great Sand Dunes, start driving to Montrose in the evening, stay the night there
Day 2: Black Canyon of the Gunnison (south rim scenic drive, east portal road), start driving to Durango in the evening, stay the night there.
Day 3: Mesa Verde, back

What kind of advice or suggestion do you have for me? I have some questions:
1. Is it safe to drive (Great Sand Dunes to Montrose and then Black canyon to Durango) during the night? Also, I think we will miss the beautiful scenery of the million dollar highway in the night.
2. I know there are lots of beautiful mountain towns along the San Juan Skyway. There are so many options and so little time that I am kind of lost. Maybe we can make some NP stuff short to make room for other small town adventures?
3. Our hiking option is limited as there will be an infant with us. What are our options here? Is there any short and easy but good hikes in the NPs or the towns nearby?

1) Would we be Stopped at Delhi Airport as our return period extend 15 days?

2) Would we be granted VOA for 15 days at BKK or would be denied and sent back as our return tickets doesn't fall under the defined criteria of return tickets within 15 days.

My flight should be arriving at LHR on a Sunday morning at 10AM. There is a Tap Air Portugal flight leaving for Lisbon at 1:45 PM.

1 - Im aware that Canadians need a tourist visa there, but Air Canada provides that during the flight.  There is also the health declaration as of jan. 2022, but that is easy to find and do.  However I am vaguely remembering having to fill out a form at the airport and dont really remember what it is, and can't find out online exactly what it is either.  Does anyone know what Im thinking of or am I making false memories?

2 - Excursions - Last time I went I had zero idea that there were any day trips or what they were until I got there.  I also cant find anything online.  Since im traveling with air canada I assume they will be booked/offered under them but it would be nice to see something before I go.  The only one I can find online is from air transat and is 11 years old.  Does anyone know of where I can find a list?

 \-2b - Any suggestions on what to do or see?  There does seem to be quite a lot to do.  Im already starting to sift through google to try to narrow things down but I really do like the suggestions ive had from here.

3 - Bus - On Cayo Coco there was a tourist bus that routinely traveled around the island if you wanted to go out and explore.  Is it fair to assume there is one of these for the Varadero area?

4 - In Cayo Coco I got eaten alive by sand fleas/flies and have not been able to find a solution.  Anyone have any idea for repellant that works on these guys?

I left a message with their support team but clearly they won‚Äôt get back to me until their working hours again, if at all. It also doesn‚Äôt sound like they do VOA anymore, correct?

What are my options? My flight leaves around midnight. Do I hope that it will get approved again by the time I leave due to them being 14 hours ahead of me? Do I change my flight to leave a couple days later? Do I change it to fly into Thailand visa-free and then fly to Hanoi? Will I be allowed to board my flight and hope that I get the email approval during?

travel,"Hello there! I am looking for any advice on the reasonability/enjoyability of an upcoming trip to Northern Italy. My primary objective is to hike the Alta Via 2 in the Dolomites and stay in the mountain huts along the way. However, I would really like to take in some culture/cities (mainly Florence) and beaches if I have the time. I'd really appreciate any advice from anyone who has done a similar vacation!

I will be in Europe July 6 through 26th. This is very preliminary, but I have the following idea for an itinerary:

Jul 6: Arrive in Munich 2:00PM

Jul 6-8 (2 nights) Munich - I'd like to spend some time exploring the city, mostly drinking pilsner and eating. 

Jul 8 (travel day): 3.5hr train from Munich to Bressanone, Italy (start of Alta Via 2 hike). If possible, would like to stop in Innsbruck Austria for lunch/the afternoon

Jul 9 - 18 (10 days): Hike the Alta Via 2. I have read 11-13 days for the average hiker. I am a very fit amateur endurance athlete (trail runner, climber, hiker.) and am confident I can move very quickly in the mountains. Absolutely no problem hiking 15 -20 mile (24 - 32km) days between huts. 

Based on a comment on a blog (I know not the best research): ""experienced/fit hikers carrying a lightish load can comfortably do the hike in six or seven days. I tend to avoid using myself as a barometer in most of the website‚Äôs articles, but I comfortably did it in six, which included breakfasts and lunches in the huts. The latter of which were usually drawn-out affairs involving multiple courses and alcoholic beverages. It was a very relaxed trip and I wasn‚Äôt exactly on the clock"" 

I am thinking 10 days will allow me to comfortably and leisurely complete the hike. I want to take some side summit climbs and enjoy an espresso or two at the huts, not just mad dash through the whole thing. 

Jul 19 (travel day and explore Venice): 1 hr bus ride from end of Alta Via 2 to Venice. Spend the day in Venice, either stay in Venice or find a later bus (2 hours) to Florence.

Jul 20 - 21: 1-2 nights in Florence

Jul 22 - 23: travel to and hike the cinque terre, spending 2 nights in the villages there. 

Jul 23:2 hr bus to Genoa, 1 night in Genoa

Jul 24 - 26: early flight to London, spend 2 nights in London, 8am flight back to US on the 26th.

Do you think this is over ambitious or will feel rushed. I travel light and don't mind checking in and out of places often, but also do want to feel like I have enough time to enjoy the cities at a leisurely pace. I will be taking public transportation the entire time. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! I'd also skip Venice if it helps spend more time on the coast/ if Florence is worth my time, but its so close to the end of the hike, figure its worth a quick stop.",Advice on itinerary for 20 days in Dolomites/Northern Italy,,bpip18,,1,2023-03-31 17:49:15

travel," I‚Äôve never really understood the term ‚Äúwanderlust‚Äù until my luggage decided to take on the spirit of adventure, and [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html) saved the day.

Last year, I had planned a wonderful vacation to Rome. I was excited to explore the ancient city, eat copious amounts of pizza, and practice my terrible Italian. But as fate would have it, my luggage decided to take a detour and explore the world on its own.

When I arrived at the baggage claim carousel in Rome, I waited‚Ä¶and waited‚Ä¶and waited some more. It‚Äôs funny how the carousel always seems to have a mind of its own. It teases you with the illusion of luggage coming around the bend, only to reveal that it‚Äôs not yours, and the waiting game continues.

After what felt like an eternity, it dawned on me that my suitcase had decided to go rogue. I approached the baggage service desk, and the attendant informed me that my luggage had been mistakenly sent to Madrid. To be honest, I was a little jealous. My suitcase was out there, living its best life, while I was stuck in Rome without any clean clothes or toiletries.

While the thought of my suitcase sunbathing in Madrid without me was amusing, the reality of the situation was less so. I was understandably upset and worried, but the wonderful staff at [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html) assured me that they‚Äôd get my suitcase back to me as soon as possible. They even offered me a complimentary amenity kit and some funds to purchase essential items, a gesture that truly made me feel cared for.

As I ventured into Rome without my luggage, I couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at the thought of my suitcase going on a wild adventure of its own. I imagined it taking selfies with the locals, trying tapas, and maybe even learning a bit of Spanish. It‚Äôs funny how life sometimes throws curveballs, but when you‚Äôre flying with [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html), you can be sure that they‚Äôre always there to catch them.

In the end, my luggage was returned to me, safe and sound, and reunited with its rightful owner (me!) in just 48 hours. And while it‚Äôs still unclear whether or not my suitcase picked up any Spanish during its brief sojourn in Madrid, I do know one thing for certain: the next time I‚Äôm planning a trip, I‚Äôll be booking with [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html). After all, they‚Äôve already proven that they‚Äôll go the extra mile to ensure my wanderlust-filled luggage and I can explore the world together.

Just remember that if you ever find yourself in the unfortunate situation where your luggage decides to embark on a solo trip, don‚Äôt panic! Here‚Äôs what you should do:

First, take a deep breath and remember that most lost luggage does eventually find its way home. Next, head to the baggage service desk and report your missing suitcase. The staff will be able to track your wayward belongings and provide updates on their whereabouts. While you‚Äôre waiting for your luggage reunion, treat yourself to some essential items (and perhaps some comfort snacks). After all, it‚Äôs not every day that your suitcase gets to experience life outside the confines of an airplane‚Äôs cargo hold. And finally, don‚Äôt forget to keep a positive attitude and see the humor in the situation. Your luggage may be off gallivanting around the world, but at least it‚Äôs giving you a hilarious story to tell when you get back home. Just remember, life is full of unexpected adventures, and sometimes, it‚Äôs your luggage that leads the way.

this July, my partner and I will be going to Europe to spend 3 weeks (1st-21st).

We have bought a multi city pass flying from LAX to √Åmsterdam and from Venice back to LAX.

2nd-6th in Amsterdam 
6th-12th in Paris
12th/13th-15th in Alsace
16th-21st in Venice 
We plan on staying in hostels, hotels and with our friends in Alsace.

travel,"Hey Everyone,

My girlfriend and I (from the US) are going to Europe this summer for about three weeks. Our basic itinerary is that we are flying into Zurich, traveling around Switzerland for four days, heading to Budapest for probably five days, then to Romania for 2-3 days, and finally ending up in Greece for another 3-4 days before flying out of Athens back to the US. We want to try to travel as light as possible considering we'll be moving around so much and don't want to lug a large bag around.

&amp;#x200B;

We have the general ideas of places we want to go, and even bought the Swiss Travel Pass so we're really going to be doing a lot of moving around Switzerland the first few days which would make it a super big PITA to try to drag luggage.   


So, question for you pros, how would we best get away with traveling light? We're really not people who need a lot of things other than some changes of clothes and such. The modifier here, is that we also don't want to check bags on the flights because that is not only expensive, but could turn out to be a nightmare if anything is lost and I've lost baggage multiple times on flights just within the US, so I don't trust baggage checking anyway.

I'm going to be working remotely through the first three countries as I've done in the past, and taking the entire time we're in China off when visiting my partner's extended family (~2 weeks).

I've not been to China before, and I've read so many worrying posts on more tech-focused subreddits about how you should never bring any electronics you care about into China, and to only use burner devices there. Mainly from a security perspective with your data and privacy, but also potentially from a confiscation standpoint too.

I'll have my laptop (with an encrypted drive), Steam Deck, Sony mirrorless camera, and two phones (main iPhone, and an older backup Android phone for local SIMs) with me on this trip, and my partner will have their iPad and iPhone with them. Do I need to worry about bringing these devices into China? 

We'll be transiting through Taiwan both coming in and out of Xiamen in China, should I find a way to stash most of our electronics in Taipei somehow and just bring in my Android phone? If we do bring everything with us, I plan on leaving everything powered off the whole time except our phones roaming on US carriers.

I guess I have no idea how paranoid I need to be realistically, and what likelihood there will be issues entering and exiting China with our devices. I get those tech focused subs will be on the more paranoid side of the spectrum based on the worst possible scenario, but I'm curious to hear traveler's perspectives too who have actually been there.

travel," Hey all, I'm currently planning a 10-day horse trekking trip in Mongolia and looking for more people to join me on this group tour! The dates are from Jun 19th - Jun 28th, 2023. Since I'm really fascinated with the history of the Mongols and Genghis Kahn, I decided to plan a trip that will hit many of the major historical sites, like Lake Khokh where Genghis Kahn was entitled as Kahn and Khuduu Aral where the Secret History of Mongols was written. Of course, no Mongolian trip can be complete without horseriding, so the tour includes 5-6 days of riding as well (at least beginner level required) through Khentii National Park .

I'm a solo traveller and I'd love to have more people join me to make the group tour happen. The price for 3 pax is $2,457USD per person. I'm hoping we can get more people to lower the price even more. I know it's quite expensive, but going on tours is kind of the only way to see the Mongolian steppe since it has no roads and is difficult to navigate by yourself. Anyway, if you're intersted, see the Google Docs link below for the itinerary details. : )

A bit about myself: I'm Taiwanese and grew up in Taiwan, Denmark, and the U.S. Being mobile in my childhood made me want to keep traveling for my adult life, so I spend half a year working and the other half exploring new countries and meeting new people. I love birdwatching, history, writing fiction, and climbing on things. I hope that this will be a chance to hang out with other travelers as well!

Then, he said he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get the pass‚Äù and asked if we would be okay with paying him in cash outside the Uber app. At this point I pulled the plug because things were super sketch. We ended up finding another Uber like 20 minutes later with no mention of the pass.  


One of our triad has spent the past few hours contending that there was nothing to worry about and that this had to be some weird local regulation he wasn‚Äôt prepared for. He argues that this driver‚Äôs decision to effectively collateralize his high (4.96) uber rating suggests that this was some honest error, but the other two of us are really skeptical.

Hey Friends. I am headed to Brazil at the end of August - September for 3 weeks and have a few things booked at the beginning, but am looking for suggestions of what to do at the end of the trip. (Solo F - 33yrs)

I fly into SP and booked a flight for a couple hours after I land, to Rio for 4 nights, 3 full days. From there I'm hittin a plane ride to Iguazu Falls, where I will be for 3 nights and 2.5 days. From there, I'm catching an early flight to Salvador de Bahia where I want to hang for about 3ish days. This is where I'm a bit stuck with my remaining 9 days. 

I'm  thinking about three options but am VERY open to any and all suggestions:  
1. I could head to Recife for about 3 days before heading to Fernando de Noronha for 4-5 nights before heading back to SP to fly home.   
2. Going to Chapada Diamantina for 4ish+ days, and then head to Recife for about 3-4 days and hit the beaches around there; issue here is I feel like 12+ hours on a bus (round trip) is a lot of time wasted in transport but it looks incredible!

Context: 

I'm in the US, my carrier is Verizon, my phone (Pixel 6) is able to use an eSIM (pretty sure, anyway). I'll be visiting Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Currently considering the Airalo European 3GB/30 days plan.

Questions:

* With Airalo, since I'll only have data, I can use WhatsApp, Signal, maps, browse Reddit, email, etc. but can*not* use regular ol' SMS or phone calling. Right?
* How does making calls via WhatsApp work? Can I do that with Airalo? Is that included in the data I pre-purchased? What phone number does it use?
* I also see Google Fi recommended a fair bit. The plan with international calling and whatnot is $40 a month. I won't come remotely close to needing an unlimited plan, so is there any other reason why I should still consider Google Fi over Airalo?

travel,"Hello

I'm a 17 y/o highschooler who is about to graduate. As a gift, my mom is taking me to explore some of Europe. Most of the trip it will just be me walking around by myself as my mom will have to work from hotel rooms. I'm planning on going for about 23 days from late march to late June. It will probably be closer to 21 full days in Europe once traveling time is subtracted. 

I guess what I'm asking for is what places can I go where I can just explore relatively safely as a minor. I'm also looking for how many countries I should try and squeeze in, as id like to explore more than one but I also don't want to spend too little time in an area to the point where it doesn't really feel like I've been there. For reference here are the European countries I've been to before as well as the ones I wouldn't be apposed to going to again.

Countries ive been: Iceland, Uk, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Albania, and Greece 

Countries id like to explore more: Switzerland, Italy, Greece

Id like most the countries I visit to be ones I've been to before, but like I said I would be fine spending a little bit more time there. So far, my mom has put forward this route along the railroad:

travel,"Hi, 

I'm going on vacation end of may and was wondering which city to visit. My initial plan was to spend 3 days in Barcelona, 1 in Madrid, and 3 in Seville. But I've heard some great things about the Alhambra and now im debating if I should visit Granada instead. Also heard great things about Valencia. 

So I'm curious to know... Which city would you visit for 1 night? 

For context, bf and I are in our late 20s, enjoy the historical architecture, culture and love food. We are not so much in the club scene, but would enjoy going to a tapa or watching the sunset at a park in the evening.

travel,"Hi all!

I'm about to start my solo travels shortly, for about a year, to South East Asia, Oceana, and South America.

I wanted to get people's thoughts on footwear, in particular the Hoka Mach 5 as a daily shoe (never owned a Hoka before). I have slightly wider feet and a higher mid-foot than the average person I would say, so I'll probably go to a specialist store for additional insight just in case, but wanted to get the expert opinion here.

My use case would mainly be for walking. I also was considering trail runners such as the Adidas Terrex line, but because some of my trails later in the year might be more challenging (such as Machu Picchu), I am considering separate hiking footwear. While versatility for light trails would obviously have been good, I think that I am good with sacrificing this for more comfort for day-to-day slow travel -  I assume an Adidas Terrex would be less comfortable walking than a Hoka for example. I do not mind packing an additional pair of footwear as going ultralight is not as big of a priority as comfort for me and my backpack has enough space to accommodate this.

In summary, I'm happy (and currently leaning towards) getting a pair of trainers, sandals, and hiking footwear, and day-to-day comfort is what I wanted to prioritise for my main/daily shoe.

Any insight would be much appreciated!",Footwear Recommendations - Hoka Mach 5 to solo travel for a year?,,LightningV1,,0,2023-03-30 22:30:21

(Basically the Canadian military said sisters arent important enough only mommies and daddies can go, and we do not talk to ours.) She still wants me to go, but flight prices are INSANE.

Basically, where I live in Eastern Canada, it costs ‚âà$400+ to fly anywhere than it would from Montreal or Toronto, so I've been looking at flights out of those 2 cities.(From my city to Athens it *says* it's $1465 RT but everytime I go to book it it goes up to $1697).

The cheapest flight that I've been looking at from Toronto to Athens RT is only $1099, but it has a 24 hour layover in Montreal both ways. I live close enough to Montreal that I can drive relatively cheaply, so if I could fly out of Montreal for this price that would be perfect. Otherwise I'd have to buy a separate RT to Toronto (‚âà$200)

BUT if I search for the same flights just without the Toronto part, it goes up to $1349 RT, from just Montreal to Athens, which is incredibly frustrating. 

I'm like. A super poor person that lives paycheck to paycheck and does some slightly sketchy things just to get groceries every month, so this trip is seriously going to hurt me financially. My hopes were so high knowing I'd have a chance to go to Europe and then they pulled it out right underneath me and I feel like a complete fool. I feel bad for my sister who already booked the hotel and everything for the 2 weeks she has off and we've been planning this for forever since it's her only break in 6 months so I feel like I can't back out of it. I'm also sick as fuck of the only travel advice online being ""book years in advance!"" Or ""save $ by not eating out!"". I'm lucky I have 1.5 months advance, and eating out is simply something I never do since I can only afford to live off of oatmeal and PB toast.

A few days after what happened at the hotel, I reached out to Priceline throughout my holiday multiple times through text and email to try and find some resolution. One of the Priceline representatives went so far and claimed that there were attempts made to contact me of the
cancellation and that I even authorized and approved this cancellation. When asked for records of these contact attempts, the
representative dismissed my request and essentially told me ‚Äútoo bad too sad.‚Äù I also tried submitting an formal complaint via Pricelines feedback website and they said ""We reviewed your issue again to confirm that we did not overlook anything that might support a more favorable resolution."" üòí

Anyways, I was also going back and forth with the hotel corporate office regarding what exactly had happened and I hadn't heard back from the travel insurance company yet. According to the hotel, the reservation was cancelled bc ""There was an issue with the rate being confirmed on the travel agent system and the hotel is not able to accept the
booking since the rate is incorrect,"" which sounds like Priceline just made up their own price?? WTF. 

After coming back from my trip, I looked into some of the legal options such as small claims and arbitration and then I came across the BBB (just google priceline BBB or expedia BBB, etc). I'm not sure how it works exactly but it is a free service and it seems like they act as a mediator between the 2 parties. I saw other peoples complaints and the resolutions provided and figured I would try it before taking the legal route. Side note, I also submitted a complaint against Expedia for an incident that happened last year, which was resolved very quickly and I got a full refund from them. 

After some back and forth with Priceline, they offered to refund the difference between the original booking and the new booking (~$460) in the form of a check. I tried asking for a refund for the full amount since I had to spend my holiday with limited funds and I wasnt able to get the full experience of my trip, but they said no. üôÑ

At any rate, I was able to recover the out of pocket expense without going the legal route, so not a total loss. I just have to wait for the check to come in the mail. I still haven't heard from the travel insurance as they are really backed up....

I hope this helps others, but ultimately, lesson learned, I'm definitely staying tf away from these companies. üôÅ",UPDATE My hotel reservation was cancelled and nobody told me,,Worried-Fun-6072,,0,2023-03-30 20:02:17

He is really active and healthy (plays tennis several times a week) but sometimes when he walks for extended periods, he has knee pain and lower back pain. I am trying to think of ways he will be able to fully participate in the trip even if he is experiencing pain. One thought is a manual Razor scooter (we used these for the kids when they were ages 4-10/12 and it went well but this was in NYC and DC not Europe), it would save him steps and we can easily fold it up and carry it when we are on public transport or in museums, etc‚Ä¶Has anyone tried anything like this in Europe? Or maybe even a skateboard? I want to buy it now so he has some weeks to practice. Any ideas or advice very welcome, this is my kids (19 and 21) first real European trip and he will be sad if he causes any restrictions.

**Option A**
-Train from Budapest to Salzburg, 2 nights in Salzburg
-Train from Salzburg to Vienna, 4 nights in Vienna
-Day trip from Vienna to Hallstatt during the 4 nights stayed in Vienna.

**Option B**
-Train from Budapest to Vienna, 2 nights in Vienna
-Train from Vienna to Salzburg, 2 nights in Salzburg
-Travel from Salzburg to Hallstatt (day trip), Hallstatt to Vienna, 2 nights in Vienna.

My thoughts: I am siding towards Option A. While we would be passing through Vienna on a longer train ride en route to Salzburg, I am not crazy about the idea of setting up in a city, leaving after 2 days, just to come back 2 days later.

I actually already know the things I'd like to visit, but was courisous to ask would it be by any means ""weird"" if I'd travel all the way from Europe to visit only the town? Because the last time I went to Montreal, CBSA was pretty suspicious that I travelled all the way to Canada ""just to visit Montreal"".

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Starting from Singapore, I want to travel back home to Berlin without going by plane.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve figured out 2 routes + 1 alternative, which seem to be doable. These are not final yet though, since I might want to stay a few days in some places or visit some more. For the routes, I just focused on finding a way home. In general, I‚Äôd rather take the train than going by bus, even if it is a little more expensive (but not overly expensive) or takes more time. I also wanted to avoid going to Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_zVg2KZfXBckAvVjiAiQvHFFs5zzti5ZWk28ePZn4o/edit?usp=sharing) with the most important information (I‚Äôm quite proud of it tbh \^\^‚Äô)

Route 2 would probably be my most desired route, since I always wanted to visit Nepal, but it got quite some gaps in the public transportation department with the biggest problem being, that there isn‚Äôt really a good way to cross the border between Myanmar and India by public transport. I could imagine myself going to hike to the Nepal-China border (if possible, of course).

Route 1 &amp; 2 share the same big public transport gap between Aktau and Kuryk.

Route 1.5 would be the alternative, since it would include Nepal and avoid any big transportation gaps. But I would have to take the plane back home to Berlin.

&amp;#x200B;

The most information for this has been gathered through [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) and [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/index.html).

I you guys have any ideas for a better route or even solutions for my transport gaps, please feel free to share them. Also, feedback and other recommendations are appreciated too.

&amp;#x200B;

*One more thing:*

For now, I‚Äôve been planning just for myself, but if anybody is interested, I‚Äôm looking for travel buddies, that might be crazy enough to join my journey. Feel free to contact me :)

travel,"Hey everyone!

I have a quick question about my US passport.

Backstory: I am a US/Italy citizen, flying from the US back to Italy. I DON'T have an Italian passport, only an American one. A

About three and a half months ago, I applied to have my American passport renewed online (which means I keep my old passport rather than send it in). This is when the maximum expected wait time was 9 weeks, which gave me a comfortable 3 extra weeks in case it was late. Because it hadn't arrived earlier this week, I followed procedure on the State Department website and called the number to have them expedite it. I was told it should be done within a few days. That was Monday, and there is no change today (Thursday). 

My question is: Does anyone know if I can fly on a passport that isn't expired? I can't find information on the State Dept website as to whether or not the passport becomes invalid as soon as I apply for a new one.

Follow up: This is pure hope, but does the State Dept issue and ""Whoops, our bad, this person can actually fly"" document in cases like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't imagine I'll have much, if any, trouble getting back into Italy since I have an ID card, and that's all I've needed every other time I have made the trip. But they might not let me leave is the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I can't just wait until the passport is ready. I have obligations in Italy and I can't extend my stay in my sublet in the States.

We did the reservation, all good, reservation confirmed. After a few hours (we were already sleeping) apparently we received an email saying that, for technical reasons, our flight reservation had been cancelled and that in the next 3/5 days they would proceed with a full refund. I called [booking.com](https://booking.com/) support and they didn't manage to provide any additional context, and we wanted to know whether this happened to anyone else? Was the issue with the airline? Should we just avoid this specific airline to mitigate future similar issues?

travel,"Hello all! We are an American couple who is traveling to Switzerland in late July. Specifically, we are headed to Bern to play tennis in the Eurogames 2023, an event during which LGBTQ+ athletes gather to play sports and celebrate pride.

I'm writing here to ask for recommendations as to a possible itinerary. We will likely be flying into Z√ºrich on Friday, July 21st. The tournament starts in Bern on Wednesday, July 26th and the last day is Saturday, July 29th which coincides with BernPride. We'll probably fly home the next day on Sunday, July 30th.

I realize that it's a really short and awkward time between arriving in Z√ºrich and needing to be in Bern, but we'd really like to make the most of it if possible. Obviously we won't be able to ""see it all,"" but any recommendations, advice, or tips would be much appreciated.

travel,"Hello! We are two lady artists (composer and painter) that are taking a Europe trip. 

We are medium-packers; we have our creative supplies and our personal things, so we're not packing light enough to be backpacking for instance. Because of our gear, I'd prefer to do only several moves, not many frequent ones.

We booked an apartment in Bologna for a month to be able to have a hub for work and to be able to spoke out for 1-2 day trips to neighboring cities. This way, we could even leave most of our things and pack an overnight bag. We feel confident about that portion of the trip.

We're wondering if we should pick another hub area for the \~18 days before we are in Bologna, or move between a couple places for about a week or so.

Would like to stay around $6,000 for 2 people, three weeks in June, including places to stay, food, fun, and any smaller transit (short flights, intercity trains).

I think hostels COULD work for some of our stays, but only ones where I can secure my violin &amp; electronics. AirBnB's, mid-range hotels, or private rooms could be good options.

Some areas of consideration:

* Zagreb &amp; Dubrovnik, Croatia
* Paris
* Lisbon
* Naples

We definitely want to do a short trip to Naples if we don't end up staying there longer, but it could be after our Bologna stay.

travel,"I had a reservation for an international flight tomorrow morning. It was a two leg trip, the first flight was delayed by 90 mins which meant I would miss my connection for the second flight. The airline offered alternatives, but I contacted them (via their website chat) to ask about getting an aisle seat and possibly a free upgrade to a comfort seat as there were no aisle seats available on the alternate flights. Somehow the agent in the chat canceled and refunded my reservation without my permission and without any confirmation. I only learned about this when I called the airline after the chat agent tried to transfer me to a ticket specialist and never heard anything.

I'm on hold now with the airline trying to find me a comparable flight but I don't think they'll be able to find anything for the price I initially paid seeing as this is now a next-day international flight and they say they are unable to price match since my original reservation was refunded. There are also no return flights for my original dates which means I'll either lose out on money spent for my accommodations by coming back early or need to spend more money on accommodations coming back later.

I've never heard of anything like this before and it's not the typical flight cancellation by the airline. The flights are still there but my reservation was canceled without my consent or permission. Am I entitled to anything here?? I might miss the whole trip (and the money spent on accommodations) because of this.

Since we will be traveling some on trains, we want to travel light. The entire trip is 3 weeks but we will have accomodations where we can do laundry.

My wife has a 25"" Travelpro suitcase that has great wheels on it even after many years. So we wanted to get some smaller carry-on sized Travelpro (Crew) spinners with really good wheels. This will allow us to walk a mile or so from train stations to lodging, also make it easier to travel light on trains.

So question - Travelpro isn't that cheap compared to our previous Samsonite/etc. They seem to have 22"", 21"", and 20"" rollers/spinners. We checked out the 22 and 21 and compared their dimensions to the official luggage allowances for carryons with our airlines and even the 21 is ***technically*** too large when including wheels. Yet getting down to the 20"", that is pretty tiny.

We could check our rollers on the flights and still be light for the trains, but it would be nice to just carry them onto our flights.

travel,"Hello. 

So long story short. I have nearly 30K in the bank. And I am currently 27 years old and have never lived on my own. My college years and adolescent years in short have haunted to me to this day. If I sound overdramatic. I apologize but how it went down still bothers me. And if you're wondering, I've been dealing with immense mental health issues since the pandemic. Counseling is ongoing. 

I want a setting where I can be free of any responsibility. I desire a setting where yes. I can have irresponsible immature and youthful fun. Basically, I want a space where I can feel like the 19 year old I never got to be even if it is for a very brief moment. 

I'll be real. The reason traveling and staying in hostels appeal to me is simply cause they resemble a college dorm room. 

Will it exactly be like college? I know that is a hard no. And I know I won't really make any long term friendships from this. And you know what? I don't desire to. I am in no mood for anything serious in my life right now. Frankly, I don't care if I whomever is staying in my hostel is a doctor and I don't care to know about that person's career. I've had an incredibly sheltered life so far, and the only thing I care about is having fun. Again, being the 19 and 21 year old I never got to be is my priority. I want that type of fun I wanted my college years should of been. I don't care how shallow and meaningless the partying is. Pleasure is the only thing I desire right now. 

I have doubts if my 30K will last me more than a year but I'll try to make the most of what I got. I have thought about pursuing being a paralegal or aviation after if I go down this route. 

I know I can't be 18 or 20 anymore but I am desperate to have some ""self serving compensation"" for those times I have missed. If I can get something out of this, then I can promise the world around me that I'll grow up. 

My apologies if this is juvenile. The truth is yeah. I am juvenile. And I am desperate to be juvenile. If you want to label me an asshole that is okay too. 

So. My question is, does this route suit me? How long realistically will my 30K last me?",Could solo traveling serve as a compensation for the college experience I missed out on?,,BloodyBloodshot,,0,2023-03-29 23:23:21

I feel that travel isn‚Äôt really for me. I‚Äôm 28, and really haven‚Äôt had many opportunities to travel before. I can count how many times I‚Äôve been on a plane with one hand, and have never left North America.

While I always wanted to travel when I was young, it just didn‚Äôt happen. My family really couldn‚Äôt afford it, and I‚Äôve never been able to just leave my job and go somewhere for weeks at a time. There also seems to be kind of an annoying ‚Äúculture‚Äù among traveling that rubs me the wrong way. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly having to hear from coworkers and acquaintances about all of the places they‚Äôve gone (with the conversation usually turning into some sort of competition to see who has gone to more places or traveled more). Some may even give you a hard time if you tell them that you don‚Äôt travel. I used to be ashamed by it when I was a kid, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as it used to. 

My partner is from a country in Asia, and she really wants me to go there on a vacation with her. I could see myself traveling with her, but at the same time I could take it or leave it. I‚Äôm good with just staying home or letting her do it herself. I also worry about what could go wrong (getting lost, having a health problem abroad, etc) and it just seems easier for me not to go.

travel,"If you're planning to fly with Turkish Airlines anytime soon, you might want to think twice after hearing about my experience with them. I recently took a flight from San Francisco to Mumbai and back, and let's just say that it wasn't the smoothest ride I've ever had.

For starters, on one of my flights, they separated me and my travelling partner on one leg of the flight. This was a major problem for us because my partner has mobility issues and need6ed assistance. They wheeled him away, and we were supposed to meet at the next gate. However, when we reunited, I found out that he had purchased a business class upgrade for $1300, after they told him it was $300. The flight attendants were of no help, so I contacted customer service. Unfortunately, it's been two weeks, and I haven't received a response yet.

To add insult to injury, on all the legs of my flight, the ""extra legroom"" seats I had paid extra for all had bassinets for babies. The airline neglected to mention this when I purchased them on the phone. As a result, I was asked to move to a normal sized seat on two out of four flights so that a family could sit together. 
On the other two flights, I had a baby right in front of me, one of which was unfortunately very sick. I contracted COVID-19 after that flight, despite wearing a mask. The baby's caregivers were asleep most of the time, and the baby often rested his head on my shoulder, which was not a pleasant experience.
I was not mad at the baby, poor little guy. 

When I asked for a refund for the extra legroom seats I gave up, the airline claimed they had no record of me being asked to move and refused to provide a refund. So they denied my request. 

 I also had issues with my meal request - I had ordered a vegan meal, but all my dishes had cheese. When I informed the stewards and stewardesses, they insisted it was vegan, even though it wasn't. 

I wrote to customer service about this, and they requested a note from my doctor stating that I am vegan, which I found odd. I did provide the note, to which they then responded, ""issue resolved'. 

Overall, the flight was decent, but the customer service was abysmal. The responses I received seemed as though they were written by people who love the books of Franz Kafka. 

It's disappointing that I couldn't talk to anyone about my issues, and the fact that they neglected to mention the bassinets in the ""extra legroom"" seats was unacceptable.

 If you're flying with Turkish Airlines, my advice would be to not rely on the on-board flight attendants to resolve any issues and brace yourself for a frustrating experience.",turkish airlines worst customer service ever?,,dylalien23,,0,2023-03-29 22:26:33

 We are planning to stay in hostles but are unsure about the ability of 17 year olds to book/check into them, some say that you only have to be older then say 14 and some dont specify. We know it will vary from hostle to hostle. Are they very strict about the age and how do they verify it, if it is a strict process how common are hostles that accomadate youth?

travel,"Hi everyone,

So I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on where to travel in the Caribbean between December and January.

So my gf and I are planning on escaping the dark european winter months for a while and spend 3 weeks in the Caribbean Sea. It‚Äôs the first time for us around there.
The rainy season seems to be over by then and I guess the weather should be fine at the turn of the year.

Activity wise we‚Äôd like to go hiking and see some nature, snorkelling but a day or two at the beach are welcome as well. Experiencing local cuisine is definitely on our list too.

Our main questions are:

1. Which islands are accessible by flight from europe?
2. Are the islands properly linked by boats? And is it easily possible to arrive at one point and leave from another island?
3. What are the expenses to expect in comparison to southeast asia for exemple?
4. What's generally useful to know before going there?
5. Which are the points that were disappointing? (if there are any) and what's to avoid?

Any advice towards which islands and/or  travel routes are recommendable for 3 weeks of time and which places to stay at are highly appreciated!
I‚Äôd say we are travelling on a medium budget. I worked enough to not spend the night in a 20 people dorm, however we‚Äôd like to avoid paying 6k for a week in a fancy suit.

* I want to choose between one of those five countries: South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and Philippines
* Duration: 1 month
* Time period: January, February, March or April
* City and countryside oriented 
* Not really interested in beach or nightlife
* Mostly want to visit historical sites, try a ton of food
* Accessible transportation methods (can't walk much or stay up for a long time because of health condition)
* More physical stuff like hiking or climbing is not doable. However, activities like kayaking would be fine since legs aren't really required.
* On the cheaper side if possible
* English is usable in a worst case scenario
* Friendly and easy to talk to people would be really nice
* Safe, I would like to leave more touristic places and go see what life in the countryside look like without having to worry too much

I swear these people who are saying this either were in the worst locations of Cairo, or have never travelled in a country who has haggling. 

First of all. Uber is Cairo has been a breeze. And SO CHEAP! From downtown Cairo to the pyramids it cost a total of $3. Uber drivers for me have been nice older men in nicer cars than the taxi. 

The pyramids, there is a lot of people selling carriage and camel rides. But if you just say ‚Äúno‚Äù in Arabic and don‚Äôt answer where your from then they will leave you alone quickly. It was not as bad as people say. 

Cairo has been great, we walked 10 miles (16 kilo meter) around town and have been just fine!People have been very nice. At night is wild because Ramadan. 

Don‚Äôt let bloggers scare you off or make you anxious. Use Uber, say no, and enjoy yourself. Cairo is a massive city with a ton of people and in every city you will have good people and you will have bad people and Cairo is no different.

I'll be traveling for about a month (32 days), and I plan to stay for at least 4 days in the 5 cities I have friends in (sums up to 20 days). That leaves in about 10 days to spent in other cities.

What I'm not sure if it really makes sense to spend 4 days in a single place (I don't really need this much time to see my friends), and also how many cities I can fit in these 30 days that makes to a healthy trip with enough days to have a good time in each city.

travel,"Hey guys

I'm thinking of going to Turkey end of the year. 

So far.. I've got this plan:
- 6 days Kadikoy, Istanbul
- 5 days Cappadocia (split between Goreme / Ortahisar)
- 1 day Antalya (out of necessity with late flights.. just wanting to get to Kas.. is there a way to get there without the overnight stay here?)
- 4 days Kas 
- 2 days Karakoy, Istanbul (before the long journey home)

I'm pretty okay with the above. Just a bit unsure with the trip from Cappadocia to Kas to Istanbul. Wasn't planning to go but the Reddit reviews are too flattering! From what I've researched, it'd be best to stay in Antalya and then bus/drive to Kas the next morning? 

Also.. what's the best route from Kas back to Istanbul? I've read it's possible from both Dalaman and Antalya. 

Would bus or car hire be best? 

Would love to know if anyone has traveled this route and their thoughts on what's the best option to get from place to place?

Many thanks in advance!",Turkey travels.. Cappadocia to Kas to Istanbul..,,Particular-Thought53,,2,2023-03-29 11:55:02

We‚Äôve just started planning our first trip to Italy as a family for late July/ early August. It‚Äôll be my wife, 18 month old daughter and myself! 

We have a total of 11 days in Italy and looking to check out as much as possible but not rushed, travelling with a kid slows you down significantly haha! 

So far we had in mind the below path 

Rome -&gt; Naples -&gt; somewhere in Puglia (open to suggestions) -&gt; Florence -&gt; fly out of either Milan or Rome. 

My family love our food and also beautiful sights and sounds. We aren‚Äôt big on night life and would most likely not be driving unless necessary. We‚Äôve heard train travel between big towns is best so that‚Äôs what we are leaning towards. Our budget is middle class if that makes sense lol, nothing overly fancy but also willing to spend on nice experiences!

Traveling in the US is expensive.

Even bad motels in the middle of nowhere cost shy of $100 bucks. You obviously need a car, and cities have no wow-factor besides a few ones, and the cuisine is also not abundantly amazing or cheap (example: $25 for a lobster roll vs a buffer of amazing cuisine in Mexico or Thailand).

The amazing nature highly compensates for it imo, but do you think if say, you had $40k for travel, it would make sense to spend it traveling the US rather than abroad?

Two questions come to mind that I'm hoping to get some guidance on here

* **Visa &amp; letter of invitation:** As a US citizen, I know that I can go through the e-Visa process that seems fairly straightforward. I'm trying to understand the best way to get the letter of invitation that appears to be required, however. I'm applying for an Algerian visa right now as well and they allow for a simple copy of a hotel reservation. My understanding for Uzbekistan is that an actual letter is required and a couple of the hotels I've come across specifically state that they no longer issue these letters. I tried inquiring with a couple of travel agencies in the country but they have not been terribly helpful. Anyone have any guidance/experience with this?
* **Aral Sea tours:** It seems that a guided tour is the only practical way of getting there. I've come across a few that are rather expensive ($800+ for 2-3 days) but I'm currently looking at a couple of cheaper tours offered by Islamek Travel.

I'm flying from Buenos Aires to Paris this summer and I'm worried about which airline/layover combination to choose.

British Airways: EZE - CDG (2 hr layover in London Heathrow)

travel,"I am aware that August is possibly the worst time to visit Spain, because it's hot and everyone is traveling, so some places are closed and others are very busy.  However, we will be in Europe in August, and are seriously considering moving to Spain sooner than originally thought, so I would like to use this opportunity to scout out some places or at least rule any of them out.  We'll be traveling as two adults and a 5 year old. 

Some questions: 

* I am fairly certain that Barcelona and Valencia are fine to visit in August, but what about other regions?  Should we skip Madrid because lots and lots of people leave, or in general?  Should we skip the south because the heat is intense, or is it not that bad?  Barcelona and Valencia are on our list because that's the likely area we'd move to and we'd like to check out the areas and schools, but I am not sure about then moving onto Madrid and Bilbao area, or Seville and Malaga area.  If any of those are good options to settle in as an expat family, that would be super helpful to narrow down the itinerary!
* Should we bother renting a car at all, or is it entirely not necessary?  My spouse will need to run at relatively high altitude through this trip, and I presume mountains are not super public transport friendly, but we could rent a car for the weekend as needed, or rent a car for a longer period if it's very handy to have for moving around.  It does seem to be a lot more expensive in Spain relative to, say, Germany, but maybe I'm not looking in the right places. 
* Our kid's birthday is in the middle of August - what memorable spot should we pick?  Amusement parks, or something else?  We previously planned to go to Europa Park before the plans changed. 
* We will need to get to Chamonix at the end of August.  By this point, we'll probably have accumulated enough stuff to make flying harder - what's the best bet to get there?  We could fly, take a set of trains to Chamonix, or take a train from Barcelona to Geneva (I think) and rent a car there to make it easier to get around the Alps.",Family trip to Spain in August - assuming not the worst idea,,recercar,,1,2023-03-28 20:06:43

travel,"Hey travelers,

I would like to get an advice. Sorry, if it gets a little bit longer.

I want/need to leave my country for a few month, because my wife needs to go to her homecountry and I decided to join. While the cause for the trip is not that pleasent (also not super duper bad) we plan to combine the trip with some fun stuff, visit some neigborhood countries and enjoy life for six month abroad.
It is relative short term and when I told my boss about it, he said directly that he will do everything to keep me at the company and enable me to do the trip anyway. I thanked him but also said that I will quit if we can't find a good compromise.

I should mention that I am lucky to work in a field where I can easily find a new job within days. So ""job security"" is not really an issue for me.

Today, HR offered me a contract that basically says, I can work in my current job, once I return after 6 month. I told the HR lady that I need to consider that and she was surprised that I was not super happy about it. I told her, I do not see many advantages in it. I'm not sure, what I exected.

Personally, I would prefer to be more flexible with my trip (e.g. return date). I also see the whole thing relative objectivly: There is an employee employer relationship and both sides need to agree if  we want to keep it going or not. If yes, great. If not, that's also fine.

So the thing is I was a bit shocked about the HR staffs reaction and asked in a work related subreddit for advice.  Everybody told me, I'm ungrateful and should be happy my employer makes me such an offer to go travelling without losing my job. I should be thankful, because other works do not have equal possibilities. And I wasted other peoples time by not taking the offer that they worked on providing me.  

That hit me harder than I would like to admit. I tend to doupt my decisions and worry a lot. Then I thought, it might also be because I asked in a sub, where work is relative high valued. So, I thought, I see what people who value travel think about the situation.

Maybe I should add, a few years back I quit a job for travelling as well and I met my wife during this trip. So I can say this was for sure the best decision of my life. The trip itself is not the issue. This will be our first months long travel since we met. We traveled here and there for a week or two but did not go on a longer trip for years. 

Would you take the freedom you get by quitting your job for travelling or would you prefer to stay employed but would be more limited concerning your trip?

On March 15, the chinese embassy opened up visa-free travel and I understand that only [negative ART test is required for inbound travellers by flight.](http://sg.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/lsfw/202303/t20230301_11033053.htm). Similarly, I would only need to present a negative ART test result to enter hk from Singapore. However, I‚Äôm unable to find any updated information regarding entry to mainland china from hk by land. This is the only information I‚Äôve found which requires a [PCR test if I have travelled overseas within the last 7 days before entry. ](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/02/03/breaking-covid-pcr-test-requirement-for-cross-border-travel-between-hong-kong-and-mainland-china-scrapped-from-monday/)


I‚Äôm really worried now as I recently just tested positive for covid on Sunday night and I‚Äôm sure that any PCR tests I take will come up with a positive result. I would really appreciate if anyone who has any knowledge on this can share any advice. 


Here is a list of additional questions that I have regarding cross-border travel. Thank you!


1. If only an ART test is required to enter mainland china from hk, can it be self-administered?


2. If a PCR test is required for cross-border entry by land: If I book another flight from hk to mainland china, does this mean only a self-administered art test will be required? 


3. If a PCR test is required: Would appreciate any advice on any other ways to enter mainland china without requiring a PCR test.",[NEED URGENT ADVICE] Cross-border Travel between Hong Kong and Mainland China as a Foreigner,,jujuyuzutea,,2,2023-03-28 17:19:25

1. I am eager to try montreal style bagel, there are few good places but is there a good one to go and maybe see how they make the bagle, St-Viateur Bagel supposed to be the best, is it custom to ask them to slice and toast bagel, in us cream cheese is extra, is it the same there.
2. I searched online and Schwartz is the best sandwich shop- please recommend, I am going to the market a lot, can anyone else recommend different places.
3. is it normal to haggle in the market? I plan on going to Jean-Talon Market, Atwater Market also is it rude to ask for sample things in particular cheese and cold cut meat

7. is seafood popular there? I don't eat much meat ( for health reason) and online search with popular food in montreal usually involved meat/ sweet pastry/stew type of dish.

travel,"I recently got back from a two week vacation in Europe and overall I had a great time! It‚Äôs my first time traveling solo and would definitely do it again sometime soon. I just wanted to share some tips but moreso things I will do differently on my next one. 

1. For a two week trip, pack one week‚Äôs worth of clothing (if possible). If you‚Äôre staying at a metro city, you will find laundromats or if you‚Äôre staying at an Airbnb or something, you can probably have the option to use their washer/dryer. I don‚Äôt pack light since I always need options (cause fashion or whatever). 

2. Get an extra adapter (especially if you‚Äôre from the US traveling to Europe, etc). Mine broke on the first day and had to find one in Venice and the ones I found at first were ‚Ç¨30+ but eventually stumbled upon one at a random store for ‚Ç¨10. 

3. Schedule rest days. Jet lag wasn‚Äôt even the main issue but after week one I was getting sick and tired of going to museums and doing touristy stuff that I just wanted to do absolutely nothing. I wanted to see as many things as I can but I guess I forgot that I‚Äôm no machine.

4. Splurge on premium economy for longer flights if you can. I highly recommend it if you can afford it. I suffered during both of my flights (to and from the US) for 10 hrs and my seats were really uncomfortable even though I‚Äôm a tiny person. I wish I splurged a little for better seats so I can at least get some sleep during the flight. 

5. Bring my own to go box. Maybe this is stupid and weird but I know in some countries they don‚Äôt really have to go boxes like we do in the US, but as a solo traveler I can‚Äôt usually eat all of the food at once and need space for dessert. One bar in Paris eventually gave me a to go box when they saw that I still had a lot of food left when I asked for a check. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed but it was embarrassing lol it would be nice to have my leftovers in my own to go box so I can munch on it later on. I think it‚Äôs a great way to not waste food especially if I can‚Äôt fit it all in my belly.


I‚Äôm not beating myself up for the mistakes I‚Äôve done during my trip, after all, it‚Äôs not going to be my last one!

travel,"Hi, trying to think about a 2 week trip to Albania +/- Macedonia and Kosovo, for 13-14 days in July.

Would start by flying into Podgorica and going straight to Shkoder and spending a day there, doing the Valbone-Theth hike, then Tirana for a couple days. (Total about 6-7 days)

Interests: some history, city life/nightlife, nature, good hostels to meet people, food and drink.

Travelling via bus apart from a probable taxi to Shkoder

Option 1, 7 days

From Tirana head to Ohrid for a day or two, then Skopje, maybe Prizren depending on time and flying out of Pristina late on the last day

Option 2: 8 days

From Tirana head South and see Berat, Gjirokaster and Himare, before going to Sarande to get the ferry to Corfu on the last day for a flight back.

Option 1 allows me to see a couple of new countries, but has no time in Southern Albania and no beach time. Any thoughts on what would be more interesting?

My layover is just for 2 hours in Milan, but the problem is that I will have to retrieve my baggage and recheck it as the airline companies change. I have a valid US visa and I do not want to leave the airport and neither change terminals.

Though, to retrieve luggage, I may have to go through customs/immigration. Therefore, I want to ask if I would be requiring an airport transit visa for this? I have a valid US visa and I am a Pakistani national.

It is mentioned at schengen visa info that a person with a valid US visa is exempt from airport transit visa. How does retrieval of baggage and rechecking works at Milan Malpensa?

The worst case, will I be allowed to travel with just a hand carry? Therefore, I won't have recheck the baggage and I would directly head to the gate of my next flight.

travel,"I currently have the international size Solgaard carry on, and I want to get a similar larger size carry on. My research seems to have led me to these 3 brands. I love the quality and feel of the Solgaard handle and wheels; however, I don‚Äôt get use out of the closet system and it‚Äôs physically smaller than the Away and Monos bags. I tried using my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs regular size Solgaard for a trip once, and ended up not using it because I couldn‚Äôt get everything to fit (my current larger carry on is a rolling duffle style, which is great, but I want one with 360 wheels).

Away has an expandable option, which sounds smart to me, even though not technically within specifications. Little undecided whether this feature is smart or dangerous. However, I read a couple things that suggested the Monos bags wheels and handle feel more durable than Away. But I know Away has done well in some reviews. 

Another difference is clamshell vs latch closure, but I haven‚Äôt settled on my preference there yet. 

In terms of the feel of rolling the suitcase, does anyone know whether the Away suitcase or the Monos suitcase is closer to the feel of Solgaard? I will be putting a very heavy backpack on top of it when i travel. 

I think my top priority is capacity, which knocks Solgaard out of the running, and my second priority is quality/feel, given my indecision on expandable and zipper vs latch. Given that, which would you recommend?

Any other brands I might not be aware of that I should consider?

I'll be going with my girlfriend, we're both in our late 20s. We're both well-travelled and have solo travelled in the past, although unlike me my girlfriend has never been to a developing country, mainly just Europe and some developed Asian countries. She's from Korea so she's not used to seeing poverty, homeless, beggars and she's not really got any street smarts at all. I'm from the UK and I've spent time in some poorer counrries so a little more wise to the world.

If it was just me going I'd have no concerns about my safety but I'm worried about my girlfriend. I'll look out for her as best as I can but can't be on guard all the time and worrying she'll find it hard to turn down grifters or deal with persistent sellers etc. 

Also concerned about stories of sexual harassment towards women. Particularly since she's East Asian and so I think she'll attract a lot of attention from men since I don't think many East Asians go to India. She's quite nervous about it and I want to put her mind at ease.

I‚Äôd also potentially like to scuba dive one of the days while out there since I have my open water scuba certification. I‚Äôd love to see all of the nature and animals while I‚Äôm out there (especially swimming with hammerhead sharks, if possible!)

That being said, I do really love Japanese culture/ cuisine and Japan has always been on my bucket list. I‚Äôd love to go and see the nature side of Japan too (Mt Fuji, Nachi waterfall, etc). I have also heard that I may possibly need at least an advanced open water certification for Galapagos, so would need to get that this year.

I understand that budget is a big consideration here so I‚Äôd say $5k USD would be my budget for the trip (excluding flights). I‚Äôd wager that budget may go farther in Japan compared to Galapagos, but would love people‚Äôs input. 

For those that have been to both, which would you recommend? Thanks!",Japan or Galapagos for 2 weeks?,,allthetunes,,2,2023-03-28 02:07:53

travel,"So I just realized I'm flying from Orlando to London Gatwick, then need to transfer to London Heathrow to Prague on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, all on British Airways. I fly out of Orlando Tuesday night, get into Gatwick at 10:10 am, then need to somehow get to London Heathrow for my connection to Prague, which departs at 1:20 pm (which means I need to get out of Gatwick, transfer to Heathrow, get through security and make it to my gate in just over 3 hours, assuming absolutely no delays on my first flight).

I'm an absolute idiot, I looked at flights on google flights but specifically avoided these kinds of bookings for this exact reason. But, when I booked using the Chase rewards program, it just said ""London"" as the connection and I didn't put two and two together, so please learn from my mistake.

Anyway, do I have any hope of making this connection? Anybody been in a similar situation that has some advice?

April 15th - 18th - Tunis (Work in the evenings)

18th - 20th - Sidi Bou Said (Work in the evenings)

20th - Douz

21st-23rd Sahara camping tour (Vacation begins)

23rd (may extend to do some other adventure in Sahara like Quad bike)

24th explore star wars hotel and chott el djerid, evening in Tozeur

25th Stay in Tozeur (visit Chebika oasis etc)

26th - One night in Djerba (Rent a car here)

27th - One night in Sfax

28th - Drive to El Jem, spend a day (Night in Monastir/Soussee)

29th and 30th evening in Soussee

1st May - Kairoukuan  (visit Mosque, etc.)

2nd - Stay in Hammamet

3rd - 6th - Any suggestions? Maybe head back to Tunis and explore Cape Angela?

Also, 15-21 is overlapping with Ramadan time. Would finding places to eat and all be a bit difficult? Initially, I was thinking of renting a car from Djerba but it seems like going from Tunis to Douz is not straightforward. Is that the case? Would I need a 4\*4 car or would a normal compact car do?

I tried different days, I never got anyone. I tried again after the first of this year, finally got through and was told no more refunds/credits were going to be given.

My girlfriend and I are spending a few weeks travelling by train around bits of France and Barcelona.

Yes I know, tourists like me are why places feel touristy.

Hopefully that isn't too broad or too much of a ramble, but basically, what would you recommend that isn't common knowledge or just absolutely shouldn't be missed, or are there any events on during any of these periods?

travel,"Hello all!

My partner and I have been itching to do our first trip to Europe this fall, and have finally started to move forward with planning. In our 10 day itinerary, we are most interested in visiting Barcelona, Switzerland, and Munich. 

Just some brief points:

\- We are trying to aim for mid/end of September as we would like to attend Oktoberfest and meet up with one of my partner's German friends he met while in the U.S. 

\- Airfare budget \~$2,000 (US dollars)

\- Would like to spend approximately 3 days in each country. Not set on what other cities besides Munich and Barcelona (would love to catch a Barca match) we would like to visit/lodge in thus far, but very open.

While doing my initial research on flights, I found we would need multi-city flights (Home (New Orleans, LA, USA) --&gt; Barcelona; Barcelona --&gt; Switzerland; Train from Switzerland to Munich; Munich --&gt; Home). Ideally, this can be done in the reverse as well, as we are really trying to work within the time frame of Oktoberfest (Sept 16-Oct 3). However, booking in this order goes a bit over the ideal budget, as there are 3 separate flights and a train from Barcelona to Zurich, Switzerland would be way too long from my understanding. We are willing to X out Barcelona for a city in Italy (likely Milan), therefore we only have 2 separate flights and can take the train from Munich --&gt; Switzerland --&gt; Milan in a decent time frame, while staying within budget. We are absolutely set on Munich and Switzerland, but any other suggestions for a third nearby country would be great.

With that being said, my main questions are:

\- What would be the best way to go about booking multi-city flights and getting the best bang for our buck?

\- Is 10 days ideal for a first Europe trip?

\- Is it worth it to keep Barcelona on the itinerary? If not, what are some other cities you may suggest?

I'm still in the early phase of my research for this trip, but airfare is something we're looking to first book by next month. Any and all advice is welcome, as this is also my first time out of the U.S! Thank you all!",Planning 10 Day Europe Trip...Advice Needed!,,msimone98,,0,2023-03-27 23:59:54

travel,"It seems a common practice up to the 2000s to negotiate with the owner or upper manager for rates even in some chain brands. However these days even stand-alone non chain owned Inns arnt able or willing to negotiate to match online rates despite how they would prefer guests book through them than through the websites that take commission off them and that they still have plenty of rooms open. But their higher rates and reluctance to lower them make guests book-online for a lower rate. it due to contracts they have with these websites? Ie hotels, booking.com

I also noticed that the bargaining culture in Mexico or among Mexican vendors elsewhere seems to be gone as well in the last five years. I guess they learned they cannot cheat customers as much as before as customers have smartphones these days.

travel,"I recently received a $2,000 cash settlement from a car accident that‚Äôs free and clear for me to use as I want. I‚Äôm graduating from college in May and want to take a trip to cross something off my bucket list. I‚Äôm a 22M, pretty well traveled. I‚Äôve narrowed it down to pretty much two options:

1) First-class flight to Hawaii. I found a screaming deal on a Hawaiian flight for $1,000 first class, round trip from the mainland. I‚Äôve always wanted to fly first class at least once in my life. So, I could cross flying first class off my bucket list and get to go to Hawaii in the meantime. However, I‚Äôve already been to Hawaii a few times in my childhood, so it‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúnew‚Äù destination for me. But then again, it‚Äôs Hawaii for crying out loud.

2) Alaskan cruise from Seattle. I‚Äôve never been on a cruise, I‚Äôve always wanted to go on one. Never been to Alaska either. I could fit a nice room on the ship and economy flights onto my $2,000 budget. The cruise itself would be somewhat between $1,000-1,500 depending on the dates. I‚Äôm a solo traveler, so it costs more than the $300-400 per person advertised fares out there.

Unfortunately, first class tickets into Seattle from my home city would cause me to exceed my budget by a large margin.

Any suggestions or any other ‚Äúunique‚Äù travel opportunities for a solo traveler which may fit in my budget?

travel,"Hey! My boyfriend and I are headed to Costa Rica for 10 days, leaving on May 28. The main goal of the trip is surfing, we both shortboard and he has more experience than me, however, I definitely can hold my own in the lineup and in more powerful breaks. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for beaches for intermediate surfers? We're trying to stay away from rocky breaks or anything at river mouths so we can have some chill surf days, but we're also looking to get barreled a couple of times; we're flexible with our location and skill. During the whole trip, we are doing hostels and using a rental car across the country so I'm trying to aim for secluded beaches that aren't touristy. We are flying into San Jose and plan to go to Jaco for the first night to rest up after our red-eye flight, however, everything else is up in the air. I see all the beaches that are listed on travel websites, however, I know that's not the best way to truly see a country. 

Other than surfing we also want a true rainforest experience away from the craziness of tourists as well as check out great beaches for snorkeling and swimming. We're not looking to stay in resorts and have a luxury experience, just be very much be in nature and the environment. Please let me know if you have any recommendations for our trip at all!

I'm currently a teacher but I have decided that teaching is no longer for me. I haven't travelles much as a teacher because even though I have the summer off, a) I don't make a lot of money so I usually worked a second job in the summer and b) I didn't want to travel to certain places in the summer because it would be too hot or too busy. 

I'd like to find a job where I can work a bunch over a shorter period of time (like a month or two) and make a good amount of money and then have a month off and then repeat. 

In an ideal world, I would be a freelance writer, but I think it's pretty unrealistic for me to be able to make enough money to travel, at least for awhile. 

I don't want to work this way forever but I'm 34 and still single &amp; childless so I figured I might as well travel as much as I can now. I'd like to have kids and the clock is ticking so if I meet the right person I wouldn't want to wait very long to have kids with them.

I have a Bachelor of Arts in English and a Bachelor of Education. I'd rather not have to go back to school if I don't have to since I don't necessarily want this to be a forever thing but I would consider it.

My dad is a pilot and his schedule was a month on/a month off for years, which would be fine while I don't have kids but when I did have kids it would suck. 

Any ideas??? Does such a job exist?? I'm not sure what sort of fields support freelance work.

travel,"Hello fellow redditors,

I'm planning a trip in late September from the UK to the US because my partner and I want to visit some National Parks and the Grand Canyon. We don't really care about the cities themselves as we're more interested in landscapes.

The itinerary would more or less be:

 Day 1: San Francisco
 Day 2: Drive to Yosemite
 Day 3: Yosemite
 Day 4: Drive to King's Canyon
 Day 5: Sequoia Park
 Day 6: Death Valley
 Day 7: Drive to Grand Canyon
 Day 8: Grand Canyon
 Day 9: Las Vegas (Red Rock Canyon)
 Day 10: Go back to sunny UK
 

I know it's a lot of driving but we're used to very busy holidays and we enjoy it. I'm wondering if it would be wise to remove Kings Canyon for example and put that extra day somewhere else. We could also expand the trip to make it 14 days but I'm afraid budget-wise it would get too demanding.

travel,"I received an email today detailing the changes. **TLDR, they downgrade the reward program discount from 10% to 2%.**

Previously you got a stamp with 10% of the value of the night for each night, and when you had 10 stamps you could use the average value of the 10 stamps for a new booking, effectively a 10% discount. 

Now you just earn 2% right away without having to save 10 stamps.

https://www.hotels.com/one-key

While I'm slightly pissed about this and think it will be slightly counterproductive (as the 10% discount was enough to keep me on Hotels.com, the poor 2% discount means I'll now just go wherever is cheapest), at least it seems like the transition to the new system will be fair, and you'll get your full stamps value in ""OneKeyCash"".

travel," 

Hi everyone,

I'm new to travelling and I have a question about my upcoming flights. I'm flying from New Delhi to Prince George in Canada with a layover in Frankfurt and Vancouver. My flight from New Delhi to Frankfurt lands at 8:30am, and my connecting flight from Vancouver to Prince George departs at 5:40pm. I booked the flights separately, with Lufthansa for the first leg and WestJet for the second leg.

My main concern is whether the layover time in Vancouver is enough for the domestic flight to Prince George. I've never travelled to Canada before and I'm not sure what to expect. Will I need to collect my baggage and go through customs again in Vancouver, or will it be checked through to Prince George? And how long does it usually take to go through customs and security for a domestic flight?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",Layover time in Vancouver: Is it enough for a domestic flight to Prince George?,,JayeshSethi,,1,2023-03-27 14:19:11

Tel-Aviv was one of the considerations for places to go so we could see the Bauhau Architecture and go to a coffee shop. So in a sense a "" chill day"" and we were probably going to go via the train then take a taxi to the area we wanted to go to. 

Other considerations were rent a car and go to Baha'i Gardens and Akka for the day from Jerusulam.

travel,"I have a couple of big milestones coming up (40th bday this Spring and 15th sobriety birthday next Summer). My husband &amp; I are going to take celebration trips for both, but I am overwhelmed looking at options and am seeking input here. We travel domestically quite a bit,  always with our kids. We have also travelled a decent amount without our kids in the Caribbean (eastern side of Mexico, Bahamas, DR, Jamaica, Cayman Islands), but we are worried about the amount of sargassum headed that way this summer and so are looking at other possibilities. I have been to France and England, he has been to Greece, Turkey, and Northern Italy. We are wanting to use at least one of these trips to go to a new place together than neither of us has previously been to. Since we have travelled almost exclusively in the Caribbean, I have no ideas what else is out there that might work for us! Some info below about each trip to hopefully help in gaining suggestions from you all:

40th bday trip:
- would be this summer, likely in mid to late June
- kid free trip! I want to relax and read a book without interruptions every five minutes
- max of 8 days so not looking at anything that that takes 12+ hours to get there from Indy/Chicago area or requires more than one connection 
- we are warm weather people, so not interested in any cold weather locales 
- I am a beach person. My husband will tolerate beaches as long as there is a decent amount of activities. He also enjoys local beers and foods. I am not an adventurous eater so would need ‚ÄúAmericanized‚Äù options
- budget for this trip is $6k max for hotel/flight/food. Can go above that for anything extra. 

15th sobriety bday trip:
- max of 12-14 days
- could go anytime from Memorial Day to Labor Day next summer 
- could either take kids (would be 3 and 8 at the time), or could do another solo trip
- my dream vacation is Maldives, my husbands dream vacation is a tour of all MLB stadiums. I like quiet, he likes to stay busy. So would need some combo of both. 
- no specific budget, within reason

travel,"This is just a rant. Just traveled on a DOH- USA flight in business class with Qsuites. I booked the ticket using a partner awards program and I was really excited with all the hype around qatar airways on social media. Although I am really appreciative of the roomy cubicle and the great bedding in Qsuites, I didn‚Äôt find the whole experience living up to the hype of being the world‚Äôs best business  class mostly due to the service. The service was more comparable to US airlines than Asian airlines. For one there wasn‚Äôt any personalized service that usually comes with traveling in premium cabins such as being addressed by name or remembering your meal preference. I had to remind them of my meal preferences during the meal service and the crew seemed to be in a hurry to finish up the meal service. The bread that they served in both meals was either too hard to eat or crumbled just on breaking it.  Food presentation wasn‚Äôt that great either (they did have a fake lamp though that added a nice touch).  The seats looked old and worn. Restrooms weren‚Äôt constantly  cleaned during the flight. The onboard movie collection wasn‚Äôt too extensive. I wonder if covid had to do something with the state that Qatar airways is in now.  Of course it‚Äôs totally possible that it was a one off thing and maybe I didn‚Äôt get their best. I have seen far better service and food in Japan airlines although their hard product are not the most popular.

\- street vendors constantly trying to speak/say something in Italian to you, whilst switching back to MSA as soon as you say no or ignore them

travel,"Hi guys, I will be visiting Singapore for a short vacation from April 5th till 9th. Fully aware that most of days in the range will be either a public holiday or religious event (Qingming Festival on 5th, Good Friday on 7th, and Holy Saturday on 8th). 

So I made an itinerary already, planning to visit a few famous hawkers, bars, and restaurants, and a few tourist spots too (Bugis, Chinatown, Orchard, Marina Bay mostly). Will most restaurants and tourist spots be closed on these holidays? For example, I plan to explore Chinatown and some hawkers in the area on the 5th, but my common sense tells me that most of the food stalls will be closed since people will go praying? Is this usually the case? Should I move it to the 6th let's say?

And also, would you guys recommend reserving spots at restaurants or rooftop bars in advance since it will be more crowded? Another question would be what will the weather be during this time? I know that it rains quite often all year long over there, but hoping for more sun when I visit lol.

Appreciate any comments or suggestions since my last time visiting was quite a while ago, thanks!","Visiting Singapore from April 5th-9th, need advice on itinerary",,askyfullofstar23423,,1,2023-03-27 08:23:05

1. Either I wait until I graduate and go on an enormous trip by myself duirng the summer (Also, I will have much more money saved up)

travel,"Hi r/travel! My wife and I are a few months into a tour of South America, and we've really wanted to visit Peru. We've been holding off due to other factors drawing us towards other countries, but now things are lining up to head to Lima, then Cusco. Visiting Machu Picchu would be a dream! From what I've been reading, the protests have died down in most of the country, and transportation around Cusco and MP has mostly normalized. We plan on spending 2-4 weeks in Cusco and wanted to see if anyone is in the area and can say how it's looking. Are things generally open and running on schedule? Any recommendations for parts of the city to stay and do some quiet studying and tourism from? Thank you for any info!","Weekly ""How is Peru?"" Post",,afminick,,1,2023-03-27 00:03:26

travel,"I'm looking for a new hard shell carry on luggage that would work for international flights and I'm between the Beis and Monos. My biggest concern between the two is the size. 

The Beis 21-inch Carry-On luggage external size on their site states that it is:  W 40cm H 58cm D 25cm / W 15.78in H 22.8in D 9.8in

The Monos states spec size on their site states that it is:  H22"" √ó W14"" √ó D9"" / H55.9cm x W35.6cm x D22.8cm

It's my understanding that the general recognized industry standard for carry on luggage is 22"" √ó 14"" √ó 9"" (in line with the Monos).

However, I do fly Air Canada very often and their sizing is much different being: H21.5in x W15.5in xD9in / H55cm x W40cm x D23cm. 

I've rarely seen Air Canada care about the 0.5 inch difference in height but they do care about the other measurements. 

So I would go with the Monos but since Air Canada does give a more room for the width, I do wish the Monos was slightly bigger (given that I am an over-packer).

What would you recommend? I am also interested to hear if there's any other brands that have the same sleek style &amp; quality in the same or lower price point. The convenience of both the Monos and Beis brands is what lurs me to them, compared to your standard luggage brans.

For context, I'm doing this simply because my it feels like my biological family hates me. They constantly call me dramatic, and as I have gotten older it seems like more and more people seem to drop away or want no contact. Alot of it is with out differences in religion. I live in the midwest, right in the dead heart of the Bible belt, and all want to genuinely not talk to me because I won't forgive my parents for sexually assaulting me as a child and went through severe abuse. That being said I testified against my dad and he went to jail, and my mom was never fully held accountable. (their mindset is- regardless of the offense if God forgave you have to forgive.) And I'm just not there, nor do I think I ever will be.

I'm actively in therapy and I'm taking meds, basically just trying to move forward in life, but I feel like I am haunted by where I live with all these memories so I need out.

travel,"Hello.

Me and a few of my friends from Sweden are planning a 2 week trip to Vietnam in Jan/Feb where we are considering renting mopeds (or something along those lines). I have some general thoughts and questions about this. We are all male in our early 20s, we all have traveling experience, but most of our previous trips have been with family and with very simple accommodation (hotel or renting villas), mostly in Europe too.

We want to rent mopeds and kind of experience Vietnam on the fly, obviously planning stops and such beforehand (not booking hotel/homestay rooms thought). Is it maybe better to actually book the places where we should sleep beforehand?

The thought we have in mind is to travel from Da Nang all the way down to Ho Chi-Minh City, but is it even possible to do this with mopeds?

 Is it maybe better to rent cars just incase? By doing in on mopeds we'd probably get to remote places a little easier.

Would it even be possible to rent a vehicle/mopeds in Da Nang and bring them to Ho Chi-Minh City (or nearby)? 

We'd stop and sleep every night in new places, is that something we can rely on, that we'll always have a place to sleep?

We'll drive mostly on the coastal roads, avoiding big city centers because of the traffic, and hopefully leave the mopeds a bit from Ho Chi-Minh City and maybe take a taxi in when we are to leave?

Another thought we've had is if it's better to go by train or bus to different towns/cities, but would it still be possible to sightsee the same amount?

There are probably a bunch of things I've yet thought about, I'd appreciate any info and advice I can get. Is it better to maybe do this in a different country instead? (preferably Asia)

Should I just buy day passes for when I am in Madrid and the return train/bus for the other cities, or is there a better option than that?

It's an exchange program, and some students stay for multiple semesters if they decide they like the program, which I may do.

I was told over the phone that Korean Air does allow this, for a fee, but I'm a little bit worried that it may have time or cost restrictions that are too far out of my budget, however the lady didn't seem to have much information I could understand. 

I have seen that it seems to depend from airline to airline, and usually a fee is involved, maybe around 100-300 USD depending on time of year etc, which is fine.

travel,"Hi! Me and my husband are thinking of having kids in a few years, so we are really trying to prioritise travelling before then. We are based in the UK, so while generally Europe is cheap and accessible to us, where we live we don't have particularly great airports nearby.

Vienna and Budapest have been on our list of places to want to visit for a while but they are a bit of a pain to get to from our local airport. Ideally we would fly into one and out of another but that's proving tricky. It would require travelling to an airport about 5-6 hours away and the way the flight times work out, that would involve probably taking at least one extra day annual leave from work to factor in that travel. We are trying to maximise the amount of travel we can do with our annual leave allowance, so ideally don't want to waste a day or two on travelling to an airport.

Bratislava is a destination that's super cheap to fly out of our local airport and as it's located kinda between these Vienna and Budapest, I'm thinking of a trip that would look something like this:

Day 1:
Arrive in Bratislava around 10am, train or bus to Budapest.

Day 2-3:
Budapest

Day 4: 
Train or bus to Vienna from Budapest. 

Day 5-7:
Vienna

Day 7:
Early bus/train to Bratislava, spend the day there 

Day 8:
Flight home from Bratislava at 7am

This trip would be early September. Does this seem doable or is it too much travelling between places?

travel,"I was recently lucky enough to listen to Robert Reynolds share his story.  Re-creating scenes and landscapes wasn't only a profession, but it was something at the very centre of his identity.¬† So you can only imagine the sense of turmoil and disruption which ensued when Robert suffered a rare form of stroke that would leave him totally blind in his left eye and subsequently rob him of the ability to paint.

Robert's approach to life since this life changing event is that he wants to spend the rest of his life maximising on vision and to do this, he has chosen to bicycle tour.

Bicycle Touring was something Robert has enjoyed doing for many decades - even prior to his life changing stroke.¬† But since this event, he has been inspired to spend the best part of 6 - 8 months of each year exploring the world on his two wheels.¬† In his own words - he needed to do something harder than being blind whilst seeing as much as possible.  He is now more comfortable out enjoying the outdoors and sleeping in his tent. 

Robert has toured extensively throughout the world, including North and South America, South East Asia, Europe and Africa.¬† I personally found inspiration listening to him recount his experiences from his cycle tours and interactions with people in different countries and cultures. 

The images below are a small collection from Robert of his cycle tours and also a couple of his art sketches.  You can hear him share his story on the Seek Travel Ride podcast.  It really gave me a sense of wanderlust and the idea of 'maximising my vision' and seeing the world at a slower pace really resonates.

travel,"Travelling is my passion and I've been fortunate to visit every continent except Europe. Next year, I'm planning to take a 3 months off with my S.O. to finally do Europe but I feel like I'm starting to seriously question the way I travel. Let me explain why. 

My travel itineraries have always been very well planned. Say I wanted to go to Tokyo. 
* First I'll search on Reddit, TripAdvisor, YouTube and Google Reviews to identify the best things to do. These would include major attractions (e.g. Shibuya Crossing) but also hidden gems (e.g. a hiking day trip to Kamakura).
* Then I'll research a good value accommodation to stay at that allows me easy access to all these places. 
* Next I'll research the best restaurants to eat at near the things I want to do. I usually watch food vloggers or search local review sites for recommendations since Google/TripAdvisor reviews are always skewed towards tourists and I prefer places that are popular with the locals. 
* Finally I'll use all of this to plan a meticulous itinerary that allows me to get to everywhere I need to be, account for travel time (with buffer) and reduce any inefficiencies from needing to backtrack. Typically I only have 1-2 things I definitely want to tick off for the day so it's definitely not jam packed like a lot of packaged tours are. 

The benefit of this approach is that I'm able to craft a very efficient itinerary that allows me to tick off the best things to do/eat in an area while optimized for the time I have. I also save money because I'll be booking bang-for-buck accommodation (which usually sells out early) and I reduce backtracking. I also reduce the amount of planning I need to when I'm travelling so I can enjoy things in the moment. 

The unfortunate downside is that I rarely get to discover things on my own. While I'm not on a tight schedule, there's still a timeline to follow so I never get the chance to just do something completely random. I do have portions of my itinerary that allow for discovery (e.g. spend the afternoon exploring a particular district with no other plans for the day) but I rarely discover anything new. I'm also starting to find that that after doing so much planning, I never feel completely satisfied when I finally see that museum I read so much about or go to that beach with a 4.8 star Google rating with 10k+ reviews. Maybe because I already know what to expect so it takes the fun out of discovering something for the first time. This is why I've recently stopped reading too much about a particular attraction other than knowing it has good reviews, but then I lose the context and why I should be seeing it in the first place so I appreciate it less. While I feel like I can over plan sometimes, I also don't completely regret doing my research either because there have been some really good restaurants, hotels and hidden gems that I would not have known about if I didn't discover them before the trip.

I guess I'm now at a point where I want to experience the joys of discovering things for myself but also want to make sure I don't miss out on the really good experiences due to not planning enough. 

Back to my future Europe trip, the old me would've come up with an itinerary that has me going through a new country every 1-2 weeks. Maybe something like [this](https://www.eurail.com/en/get-inspired/suggested-itineraries/european-highlights-itinerary). Every country will have it's own itinerary based on our interests with accommodation and transport booked well in advance to save on costs. But I'm wondering if I should plan less and just work it out when I'm there. Is it possible to do this in Europe? I'm thinking of going from March to June so it will be before it gets too busy. How could I go about this new way of travel? I have so many questions like:
* How far in advance will I need to plan? Say I was I started in Rome, how do I know how long to book my accommodation? If I wanted to go to Florence next, when should I book my accommodation and how would I know how long I need to book for? 
* If I don't plan anything beforehand, how would I know where to go next? My S.O. and I won't be meeting new people much so we'll probably be looking things up online. Given we're going to be getting ideas online anyways, isn't it more efficient to do it before we go travelling so we can focus our holiday on enjoying the country we're in rather than planning? 
* One idea I heard was to book accommodation but ensure they have free cancellation. That way you can be flexible and change your trip itinerary when you learn about new things. I feel like if I did this, I might end up sticking to the accommodation I had pre-booked because there was a reason I wanted to go to those places in the first place. How can I learn about new things to do that I won't necessarily know about from doing research on Reddit, Google or TripAdvisor?

Keen to hear if others have had similar experiences on trying to not over plan and how you've dealt with this. And for those that have always travelled with minimal plans, how you manage to be comfortable with knowing you might not see everything and saving on costs.",Mid life travel crisis: how to balance planning with discovery?,,acinod,,0,2023-03-26 03:12:25

I am very unfortunately sick on my 9 day trip to spain. it hit me day 3. i am wondering if anyone can give me a good idea of what kind of treatment option i can get here. i went to the farmacia and they gave me cough drops and some thing to bring neck lymph node swelling down but i think i could use more. i wasn‚Äôt able to fully explain my illness in spanish. j think it is a viral infection. i have a terrible sore throat (first thing to come) and then later a very runny nose, and now a constant clearing of the throat and occasional cough and a VERY red eye that came this lovely morning‚Ä¶ what can i ask for at the farmacia to help? should i go to the doctor? i am just worried about the price because i do not have travel insurance (yes i know i made a mistake) and no it is not covid i got tested. I am staying inside to prevent the spread

Thank you for the advice the other day about using Google Flights to figure out stopovers. I've been checking out the multi-city tool. 

I now have a question about what this means and how it is different than the multi-city setting. It is giving me results that are, for example, from Tel Aviv to Cairo OR from Tel Aviv to Paphos, but not results that are from Tel Aviv to Cairo and Paphos.

travel,"Hey all,

I'm beginning to plan my vacation this year and have decided on a European solo trip. I'm leaning towards UK (splitting time between the various countries if the time allotment makes sense) or Germany just because I know about the rich history each offers, but am more than willing to hear about alternatives. 

I guess as an American I'm partial to those two because we learn and see so much about them right from childhood, but I of course know other European countries probably have amazing history that I'm just unaware of, so I'm willing to be convinced!

General details:

- 31 year old American male
- I want to spend about 2 weeks on the ground, but will give myself about 16 or 17 days total to account for travel time
- In any new area, my top interests are:
    - history (monuments, castles, religious shrines, museums, etc)
    - food
    - sightseeing (outdoor experiences)
    - ""excursions"" when available (catamaran ride to a waterfall or ATV riding type experiences)
    - I don't care much about beaches or water activities, but I'll hit them if available
- I want to feel safe and be able to explore and walk around freely - not being confined to a resort
- Money isn't a great concern, but if one place is currently 2x more expensive than other places due to currently global financial conditions, I'd take that under consideration

Two friends and I spent 2 weeks in Thailand last year, split between Bangkok and Chiang Mai and it was AMAZING. Was my first true international trip (had a previous vacation to Jamaica, but 80% of it was at the resort, and the other 20% was guided excursions and tours). In Thailand we felt safe enough to just explore freely, walk and travel wherever we wanted, eat at local food spots where we couldn't even understand the menu, etc. I thought the culture shock would've hit me but it didn't at all. Best of all, we went during ""monsoon"" season so the tourist levels were massively down. Almost felt like having the cities to yourself (and it barely even rained anyway).

This makes me think I want that same ""totally different culture"" type trip this year, which would be an argument against a place like UK. But I don't want to get stuck in one type of travel experience, and I've always wanted to visit the UK anyway, so not ruling them out.

travel,"Hi all,

Right to the details.

Who: married couple with a 2.5 year old + 3 month old (will be at time of travel)

When: Early Sept to early Oct (can shorten or lengthen based on cost)

What: Road trip vs flight vs train. Either drive to the location with frequent stops. Or fly there, and then when there use public transit/trains to go between locations. Car easier to lug stuff, but parking in any big city sucks. 

Where: This is the big question mark. We've debated getting a place in Chicago (we're outside the city) but we are there all the time. Summer time Chicago is amazing though. Or an east coast trip [Boston, NYC, Philly]. We've even debated Paris for 3 weeks, but have apprehension about international travel with an infant for health risks. Anywhere is open I guess, if it fits:

Budget: All in I'd like to spend less than 8k. (Includes flight, rental car if needed, airbnb, logistics - not food/drink/experience)

Wants: Central location- would love to walk to coffee, park (walking trail + a few kids playgrounds), great restaurants. Public transit decent system. (Bonus if there's a rooftop I can chill on, gym attached/near by, or a beach near by)

Give me some suggestions. As a note, we've traveled to 25+ countries, and 6 with our toddler. I'm not sure being in one location for 3-4 weeks would be that exciting (outside of somewhere like Paris where we could day trip all over), so probably best to have a few different places/locations.",Travel 3 to 4 weeks (with toddler + infant) help,,RevolutionaryCoyote8,,0,2023-03-25 19:23:08

We don't use any baby carriage, only a baby carrier, a Marsupial (don't exactly know the English term) and we like:
- nature (hiking, etc);
- beach;
- cities with a good cultural identity (typical foods, vibrant life, etc), which somehow excludes those tourists resorts or cities that have mass tourism). So basically, we like the 'off beaten tracks'. 

We're from Portugal and locations 'close' to us that check these boxes are basically Mediterranean destinations:
- Greece. Con: travelling from islands to islands can be very tiring for a baby 
- Balcans (Croatia, Slovenia, Albania, etc)
- Sardinia. Con: a bit expensive
- Sicily. Con: Big island with the main attractions being far from each other
- Cyprus
- Malta 

And many more that are good candidates for us.
From all of these that I mentioned, Malta is increasingly gaining our attention. Is small, beautiful beaches and nature, historical cities, the north is countryside and relatively cheap.

travel,"Hi all. Me and three of my friends are planning a 10 day trip to Europe in mid May and bought plane tickets with no ideas of what to do. We land in Geneva, Switzerland, and leave from the same place 10 days later. We want to pack the most we can into those 10 days. As broke college students, money is tight, but if something is worth the money, we‚Äôll do it.

As of now we have the basic idea of staying in Geneva for one day, then traveling by train to Paris, staying for a couple days, then traveling to Germany. From there we would head back down to Geneva and be on our way. 

Is this plan too ambitious with our allotted time? Is there anything we absolutely shouldn‚Äôt miss? This is a very basic plan and could absolutely be completely changed.

As for what we enjoy, nature and city exploring are equally valuable.

We are going on a trip together in July for a week and another in October penciled in, but we are struggling with me planning vacations that she cannot join.  Specifically, I want to book an 11 day trip to New Zealand wrapped into Labor Day holiday, but she's upset because she already has 4 days allotted off then and wanted to do a shorter trip closer to home.  She also feels like we won't go back to New Zealand together as it feels like a ""once in a lifetime destination.""  

We both want to try to have kids in 2ish years, so I feel the window is closing on taking a 25 hr flight/travel day while I am healthy enough to do hiking/backpacking there. Granted this is also a dream of hers (we have similar interests).

travel,"Posting this here for anyone who, like me, has struggled to find any up to date information about crossing the Wagah border overland, or about the Pakistan e-visa application process, which becomes  particularly complicated if you're attempting it from India.

Various people in India had warned me this wasn't a good idea, maybe because India might not let us back into the country with Pakistan stamps in our passports (if this was true, it would rather invalidate the idea of Wagah being open to tourists at all..) but TL;DR it all worked out smoothly. No problems at the border whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pakistan visa process**

* We (my partner and I) are UK citizens, we already had 1-year multiple entry visas for India, and applied for Pakistan visas while we were already in India. We applied through the Pakistan e-visa service [here](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/e-visa). 
* First issue is that the Pak website is blocked in India (not sure whether by Indian gvmt or by Pak). Can get around this with a standard VPN. However when it gets to the payment stage, it detected my VPN (ExpressVPN) so I had to give my login details to a friend in the UK, and get him to log on and make the payment for me.
* Conflicting information on the website as to what you need as supporting documents - one page says hotel booking only, one says letter of invitation. I made a cancellable hotel booking in Lahore and submitted the PDF of the booking. I didn't submit a letter of invitation and was never asked for one. 
* Once we'd applied and made the payment, we got a response the next day asking for further documentation - an itinerary, and a list of ""accompanying members"" with passport copies. For the itinerary I wrote a word document with a vaguely sensible 1-week itinerary (which we did not follow at all in the end), with hotel details, but without having made any further bookings, and submitted this as a PDF. For the accompanying members I just added a document with both our names and passport copies together. This all seemed to be sufficient. 
* We didn't receive a response from this point for 3 weeks (not the 7-10 working days it claims on the website) despite repeated emails / attempted phone calls (no answer). At this 3 week point I received an email from the London embassy asking if my partner and I could attend an interview in London 4 days later. We were in India at this point so obviously this wasn't possible - I emailed them to this effect, and they forwarded that back to the main Visa company, cc-ing me in. 5 days later, we received emails telling us the applications were approved, and we could go on the website to download the Visa Grant Notice we needed to clear the border.
* So in total it was 27 days from application through to approval. I was given a 30 day visa, with entry at any point over the next 3 months. My partner was given a 45 day visa for unknown reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Clearing Wagah border**

* This was really no hassle at all, in either direction. From Amritsar there's a cheap bus to Attari from where you can get a rickshaw for 10 mins to the border proper. The biggest difficulty was finding the right place to go at this point, because everyone points you towards the tourist bit of the border where you go to watch the closing ceremony. Just make sure you say ""Pakistan"" to anyone trying to point you the right way.
* Then it's just a matter of about 5 different officials filling in the same details from your passport, and some luggage checks. There's a woman who tries to get you to take a polio vaccine too, but we just insisted that we had had them already (we had) but didn't have any proof (same thing on the way back).
* Some waiting for a bus to go across to the actual border line at this point, where enjoyably you get to cross through the main gate where they do the ceremony, past all the guards in their regalia (we actually backtracked after clearing Pak customs to watch the closing ceremony). 
* Then Pak customs was no issue, just a stamp on the visa grant notice and in the passport. Minimal questioning about what we were doing or why. 
* From the Pak border to Lahore - you have to walk a bit of a distance until you can find any rickshaws or taxis. We took one rickshaw to Wagah town and then got a taxi to take us into Lahore. Was inexpensive.
* In the other direction, we got dropped off right by the customs office on the Pak side, had to queue for a while to get stamped out, then again for the bus on the Indian side, but otherwise was quick and painless. We cleared it in 2 hours (about the same as the other way).

&amp;#x200B;

**Experience in Pakistan**

Almost entirely easy and pain-free - beautiful country, incredibly welcoming people. As I mentioned we didn't stick to our ""itinerary"" at all, or to the original hotel booking, which caused no issues at all. We actually ended up spending 3 weeks total, seeing Lahore, Islamabad, Taxila, Peshawar (just a day trip due to potential security issues) and driving up to Hunza, Nagar, KKH up to Sost, Skardu, then flying back to Islamabad. Seems like a pretty safe time to go to Pakistan (FCO advice agrees), though obviously things can change.",India to Pakistan overland and back via Wagah border - trip report March 2023,,crassius,,1,2023-03-25 05:05:10

I could really use some help dealing with Viking River Cruises. I am trying to get a $3400 fee waived on a ‚Äòsingle supplement charge‚Äô because my 81yo mother isn‚Äôt able to join me on our cruise we originally booked and paid for in 2019. We were supposed to sail in Spring 2020, but covid took care of that. We didn‚Äôt request a refund but opted to rebook. Another wave of covid and we rebooked again. And again. Each time a sailing was cancelled, they issued us a voucher. It is finally time to go, but my mom just informed me she wasn‚Äôt going to take the trip because of her health. When I notified Viking that my mom would not be sailing with me, their response was ‚ÄúIf you chose to cancel your mother from the booking, the single supplement charge will be equal to your mother's cruise fare that was paid on the booking. Since this was paid in a voucher form, this will not be kept applied to the booking and will then need to be paid over and above the voucher that you have applied to the booking‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt *originally* pay in voucher form.

The two hotels are Hotel Duquesne and Hotel Brighton. Duquesne is in the 7th arrondissement which is already pretty close to the tower. Brighton is located in the 1st arrondissement and close to the Louvre and Tuileries. One of my thoughts is if Duquesne is too far away from everything else.

I'm from Portugal, and I will soon start to make regular trips all over Europe and beyond. Countries with all kind of different currency.

Background:
I purchased a flight for my mom (she‚Äôs 73). After emailing/sending her all of the flight information, she tried logging into the airline‚Äôs site to print off stuff. 
Except apparently it was NOT the airline, but some fraudster site. When she kept having trouble getting the detail or her flight, she called the fake site‚Äôs customer service number. They proceeded to tell her that there was a balance due. And of course my mom paid it! She‚Äôs not the sharpest tool in the shed üò≥
She then proceeds to inform me (via text) that the full amount of the ticket wasn‚Äôt paid, but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. ü§¨
At this point Im thinking something fishy is going on &amp; called her. She told me the United agent was very pushy and said that there was a balance due, and she just paid it. I was baffled, because airlines will NOT issue a confirmation number without full payment (at least I‚Äôve never experienced this in my life!).
I called United to confirm the details of her itinerary, and as I suspected, the flight was paid in full, with my card &amp; there was no balance due, nor was there any indication another transaction had been made. 
I immediately called my mom back and told her to report this to her credit card company as fraud, which she did and was refunded the fraudulent amount taken from her.
Fast forward to today and now she‚Äôs getting threatening texts from that fraud company threatening to cancel her reservation unless she pays up. WTF do I do?

1. Is it rude to put your feet on your seat? I'm taking a trip somewhere and it'll be the first time I've been on a flight longer than 3 hours. For my previous flights, I just kept my feet on the ground because it wasn't uncomfortable or anything, but I'm someone who never sits normally. I always have one or both legs up because it's more comfortable for me. Sitting normally makes me legs feel weird and I don't think that'll just go away on my upcoming flights. Now, when I say ""put my feet up"", I don't mean take of my shoes or stick them on the arms of the seat in front of me, I just mean sitting with my legs crossed, hugging my legs to my chest, etc. I never see people do it so I don't know if it's some unwritten rule that you're not supposed to do it or if it's just not that common for people to sit weird.

2. Is it annoying when the person in the window seat leaves the window shade up the whole flight? My favorite part about flying is being able to listen to music, stare out the window, and just think about things, so when I'm in a window seat I usually keep the window shade up (unless the sun is blinding me).

travel,"Just want to share my experience in getting compensation for my parents' flight with Condor due to a 30hr delay.

BACKGROUND

In August, my parents had a flight from ATL to FRA. Unfortunately, the flight from NYC to FRA was delayed. They kept delaying it by 5 to 7 hours which ended up being 30 hours.

There was no one at the help or check-in desk until the time of their flight which made it impossible to talk to someone in-person to try to change flights or obtain their check-in. The call center was of no help.

I want to emphasize that the call center was not helpful at all. My parents were due to depart at 9 pm but I was still receiving text messages from my mom at 11 pm. I was due to meet my parents at the airport and did not know when they ended up leaving, and had no other flight information. It was not on their Condor account, nor did we receive an email (actually they stopped sending emails after the 1st delay). I called the call center and they kept telling me that my parents' flight wasn't delayed and they should have already arrived the day of the flight.

They arrived and the luggage was lost. When we finally received their luggage, one was broken.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPENSATION

They were told to file for the compensation online.Unlike other airlines, it was a bit difficult to find.You have to file a complaint and under that you have the option to request for compensation for a delay or make a general complaint.

I have attached the link for easy access

[https://www.condor.com/us/help-contact/contact/customer-relations.jsp](https://www.condor.com/us/help-contact/contact/customer-relations.jsp)

Timeline as follows:

Aug 11: Original flight (afternoon)Aug 12: Flight to FRA (Late night)Aug 13: ArrivalAug 14: Compensation form sentAug 15: Received a response approving compensationAug 19: Received an email from a Customer Service Representative (CSR) stating that banking was incorrect so they will send a check and to expect it in 4 weeksSept 27: Emailed the CSR stating that I never received the check. I also filed another compensation request.

At one point, I called the help center and again, they were not helpful. One representative stated that the flight was not delayed so I cannot receive compensation. She did not listen when I stated that I already received an email approving it. She repeated the above and/or said that it must have been a mistake.

Another representative said that they could not find any information of my parents' account or flight information.

3rd representative stated this wasn't part of their department and transferred me to billing. The finance/billing department found my parents' account but said the check was cashed. When I share that we did not do so, they said we need to investigate and see if anyone had stolen our mail and the police would deal with it. Otherwise, it was out of their hands.

I went through my parents' security cameras from Aug 19 to Oct 25. I didn't see anyone taking anything from our mail so I wondered if a USPS driver had taken it.

Oct 26: Emailed CSR again, filed another compensation request and filed a general complaint with the screenshots of all the previous emails. Also, contacted USPS.

Nov 20: Sent another email, filed another compensation request, and filed a complaint for the damaged luggage.

Dec 23: Sent another email, filed another compensation request, and filed a complaint for the damaged luggage.

Jan 9: The same CSR responded to the damaged luggage complaint requesting more information. I responded requesting to address the compensation issue first.

Jan 10: The same CSR confirmed the check was not cashed and to re-send my account information so they can process the transfer. I responded and no response.

Jan 13: Emailed the previous 2 emails where the CSR emailed me. Filed another compensation request

Feb 3: Emailed the previous 2 emails where the CSR emailed me. Filed another compensation request

Feb 10 to 21: I sent emails to the CSR the previous emails, filed a compensation request, and filed a general complaint nearly every day.

Feb 22: I received a transfer of 2x my parents' original flight to my account. No emails/updates---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think annoying them helped.

I now need to try to receive compensation for my parents' damaged baggage.

You can try to call the call center but they were never helpful when I called and the wait was sometimes quite long (the longest was 40min)

Also HIGHLY recommend only paying flights on a credit card so you can easily dispute. Also, HIGHLY recommend AMEX.

Hope this is helpful or brings reassurance to someone.",Successfully received compensation from Condor,,BlaBlah_12345,,0,2023-03-24 19:10:14

travel,"Hi, I'm turning 30 next month and would like to do something special to celebrate. I want to do something challenging and I've been looking at the camino de Santiago / tour de mont blanc as I've got friends who have done both and loved them but just wanting to see if anyone else has any similar ideas? 

I'll be going from 22nd April - 30th / 1st May so around 9/10 days. I'm not crazy fit but I do cycle 16 miles round trip to work twice a week so I'm not crazy unfit and I love walking and hiking generally. 

Price isn't too much of a problem but would prefer to keep it cheaper if possible. I'm based in the UK so anywhere in Europe would be great. I'd also like some sun as this will probably be my only big holiday this year. 

I'm neither super social nor anti social, I'll happily fall in with a group of people or just plod along on my own listening to a podcast or enjoying the scenery, probably a mix of both would be best. Don't have any dietary requirements, don't really want to camp so would rather stay on hostels. I speak French, a bit of Spanish and will give any language a go really. Can't think of any other info that would be useful but if there's anything please feel free to ask!

Bit of a background: I am an Indian national with a US green card, I live on the US east coast. 

I was planning to book my travel to Havana for 4 days. However, when I went on the United Airlines website, it has the following alert:

*Travel to Cuba is available for authorized travelers only.*

*The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (""CACR"") administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (""OFAC"") authorizes only certain categories of travelers for travel to Cuba. Tourism is not permitted. All passengers traveling on United Airlines to or from Cuba must certify their eligibility under one of the authorized categories and have the necessary visa. For more information, see our* [*Travel to or from Cuba*](https://www.united.com/ual/en/US/fly/travel/destination/international/cuba.html) *page.*

When I went on that link, it specifically mentions ""Travel for tourist activities is strictly prohibited"". It looks like Tourism is not permitted anymore?

Now I've been to all three cities, but in the case for London, the only time I visited in the last ten years was during a long layover so I only had 2-3 hours in the city other than that i havent been in years. For Munich, I visited the city for a day when I was like 12. Berlin however was the last trip I made before COVID (back in August 2019) and turned out to be one of my favourite places I've ever been to, the difference this time being that I'd be a solo traveller as opposed to visiting with family, there's also things I didn't get to see when I was there last that I would've liked to have seen.

As mentioned above I'll br a solo traveller, if I was to visit any of these places I'd love to do the typical touristy attractions, eat some good food and maybe also do a bit of shopping. Nightlife isn't a major priority to me since I don't drink alcohol but I wouldn't say no to going out if the scene is good.

I am in the early planning stages for a trip in the first week of May to Israel and Jordan. I was hoping to visit Palestine as part of it.

Draft itinerary below:

Day 1 - land in tel aviv

Day 2 - 3 - tel aviv

Day 4- Jerusalem

Day 5 - fly to Amman

Day 6 - Petra

Day 7 - wadi rum

Day 8 - travel back to tel aviv

Day 9 - flight home

Thoughts? Am I cramming too much in? I will be living out of a backpack so nothing heavy duty in terms of lugging luggage about!

I‚Äôve been trying to research transport. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt drive but I understand there are buses and trains between tel aviv and Jerusalem. 

What would be the best way to access Jordan? By tour booked in advance from Israel? Or is it worth flying to Amman myself and organising a tour to Petra/wadi rum from there myself? 

How easy is it to get into Palestine (and back) to Israel (presumably Jerusalem is the easiest access point?). I‚Äôd be interested in a tour of the Palestinian side - any suggestions of ethical companies would be welcome!

It was a horrible experience. No online check in was possible in Gran Canaria, so we were in anxiety about how long it will take for us to do check-in and they gave us no info about when the check-in will open either. Then we realized that we reached the airport too early(3 hours before the flight time) because of not knowing when check-in will open, only to find that check-in was only possible only 2 hours before the scheduled flight time.

Once, we were done with check-in, the flight was told to be delayed by 40 minutes but the journey ended up being delayed by 1 hour at the destination. Once we reached there, there was only 1 exit for a medium sized Boeing 707, with more than 250 passengers on that plane. It took us nearly 15 minutes to exit the plane. Then we had to take a bus to the airport which took about another 5 minutes. I've never experienced such horrible exit from any other plane in my life.

All these delay accumulated to a nearly 1.5 hours of delay, which meant that we missed our connecting train to our destination, despite having an original gap of 90 minutes. It caused us so much problem because it was already evening and alternative train connections were hardly there. Fortunately, despite all these problems caused by the Corendon Airlines, we found another train connection without paying anything extra for the long distance trains, but cost us 2.5 hours of delay (plus 15 euros of taxi cost as it was too late, at 2 am in the morning, to take the local tram within our medium sized city) .

We want to go somewhere tropical like the Maldives, however upon doing research most tropical islands are either in rain season / hurricane season. We‚Äôve looked at Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and most of the Caribbean. Out of what we‚Äôve looked at, it appears Aruba or somewhere in Mexico like Isla Mujeres would be perfect. However, it seems impossible to find any package holidays from the UK to these destinations? Is it a case of booking the hotels and flights separately?

I'm planning a ~4 month trip to New Zealand and the South Pacific for 2024, and I'm trying to decide if I should take it in the Southern Hemisphere Fall/Winter (March‚ÄîMay) or Winter/Spring (August‚ÄîNovember).

I'd like to spend 2 months exploring New Zealand and 2 months exploring other island countries in the South Pacific. My goals are decent weather for hiking, lower crowds, and lower prices, so I'm considering two shoulder season itineraries:

**Itinerary 1:**

* March: New Zealand South Island
* April: New Zealand South Island, North Island
* May‚ÄîJune: Fiji, Vanuatu, other countries

I also have February free, but I didn't see an obvious place in the region to spend that month‚Äîany suggestions? I considered Australia, but I'm concerned about the summer heat.

**Itinerary 2:**

* August‚ÄîSeptember: Fiji, Vanuatu, other countries
* October: New Zealand North Island, South Island
* November: New Zealand South Island

travel,"Long story short, he booked a cheap flight to Edinburgh, Scotland a few months back without fully understanding it. Overall, it was supposed to go: board in USA, fly to London, fly to Edinburgh, stay a few days, Edinburgh back to London, London back to USA. He decided to skip his first Edinburgh flight and go to Italy instead, he then took a train up to Edinburgh, thinking he could catch his remaining flights home. Instead, he no longer has tickets home, as American Airlines will apparently cancel your whole itinerary if you ""no show"" a flight. He's now trapped in Edinburgh with less than $100 to his name. 

Does *anyone* know what we should do? I have no idea where else to look for advice. This doesn't even seem legal to me, but his tickets were crazy cheap so who knows. I don't have the ability to bail him out of this. Is there anyway we can get those tickets back? Does anyone know of a way to get back to the states that costs less than $1k?

Orbitz has some packages, one is for Hotel St Pierre in the Latin Quarter. The Latin Quarter is where I would prefer to stay since a lot of the places I want to see will be there. I'm a big fan of the movie Before Sunset. I'd love to see the places they walked and visited in the movie :)

I would also like to see Versailles if time allows. Eiffel tower, the catacombs, Musse d'Orsey, Pantheon, Montmartre are all on the list as well. 

Orbitz has, with the round trip flight on Air France and 8 nights at Hotel St Pierre for $3,512 US dollars. 

I have never been out of the country before so this all new to me. Is this a decent price? Any other suggestions that anyone has, please let me know!

I have been reading the content and think I know what to do. I just have a question about application. I'm looking to fly to Melbourne from OKC or Dallas the last week of June and return the first week of July. If I book just a week earlier (and most weeks prior), the flights are up to 1,000USD cheaper! I'm probably oversimplifying things, but I was hopeful that as the date approached, and the last week was as far out as the weeks prior, the prices \*might\* look similar.

It looks like there is a 4-10 week sweet spot on average, based on the FAQ and other guides and experiments here. I just got a little lost, because it seemed like there may be a ""if costs are changing"" clause. The flights I was monitoring increased by 400USD over the course of one day. Only a few Dallas flights dropped.

So I am wondering if the apparently wild fluctuation should change my strategy? I wasn't sure what to do with that based on all of the guides here.",Applying all of these principles to get to Melbourne,,KaleMunoz,,1,2023-03-23 21:03:50

At the moment I've been thinking of either Latvia (Riga), Lithuania (Kaunas or Vilnius), Estonia (Tallinn) as I'm booking with pretty short notice so it is whatever is available and cheap. However I've also seen flights to Zagreb and various cities in Romania.

I'm going to be travelling on my own, and I would probably like to just walk around a bit in the day and visit interesting site/smuseums and then eat at nice restaurants and drink nice beer for the remainder, I'm not into clubbing but like interesting bars, pubs and restaurants. I'm mostly worried about going somewhere and being bored after a day because I am really a bit too lazy to travel anywhere outside of where my flight goes to lol

The places I mentioned all sound interesting but I don't know much about Croatia/Zagreb and Romanian cities.  I'm also open to anywhere really, ideally in the Baltics area as I've never been there before.

I need to get a USA passport in under 4 weeks (i have a international flight booked for the end of April)  I had a passport when i was younger than 16 so it looks like i'll have to get a new passport instead of renewing.  


What I have found online is that there is a expedited option that takes 5-7 weeks not including the time it takes for it to mail and then the next option is urgent travel which has to be within 14 days before your travel. Then i also have see expeditor companies that say they can get it within 2-9 business days. However i am hesitant with those companies due to them being more risky since they could just be scams.  


Thus my question is what is the best method i could take to get my passport in time of my trip?   
How sketchy would it be for me to book a flight/hotel to Mexico in the next two weeks so that i could make an appointment for the urgent travel on their website it says it requires proof of travel. what exactly do they need and how much do they look into your reasons for travel?

travel," I recently booked a flight with Air Canada to Berlin, which is a code share with Lufthansa. My intention was to fly on a 747-400 before they are retired. However, I encountered a strange issue while checking my booking on Lufthansa's website. My name, let's say it's ""John Doe Smith,"" appeared as follows: First   


Name: John Doe   
Middle Name: Doe   
Last Name: Smith

Despite this, my name was correctly displayed as John Doe Smith on the Air Canada booking confirmation, and both airlines' contact centers confirmed that my name was correct in their systems. Unfortunately, no one could resolve the discrepancy on Lufthansa's booking site. This has left me wondering if this will cause any problems during check-in.

Moreover, I noticed that Lufthansa's website no longer offers advanced seat selection, meal selection, and other options that were available a few weeks ago. This has added to my confusion and concern.

I wonder if by making some meal selections a few weeks ago has caused my ticket not to sync properly with Lufthansa's booking website?",Lufthansa Website/Ticket Issue - Middle NAME DUPLICATED?! (Air Canada CodeShare),,Neat_Onion,,1,2023-03-23 13:50:30

When I went to ask her for it, she asked me ‚Äúwho are you going with?‚Äù I answered by telling her I‚Äôm going alone and she said no because it‚Äôs too dangerous. She never explained why it is dangerous but she wouldn‚Äôt let me get my birth certificate. I told my dad about it and he said that he agrees, asked why I want to go alone, and said even he wouldn‚Äôt do it. I responded with how I‚Äôve wanted to go there for years, and that if I want to go for the first time I want it to be a solo experience. 

I told them both that it‚Äôs one of the safest countries to visit and that I‚Äôd be fine. Granted, I can‚Äôt help with natural disasters, flight delays, and things like that, but overall I feel I‚Äôd be fine. I even plan on getting travelers insurance.

travel,"I'll start with some prelude (possible tl;dr), I hadn't left my home country of Australia until I was 25. I took a voluntary redundancy and travelled Europe to see 28 countries in 2019 (VERY good timing I know!).  
While meeting lots of people on my travels, Europeans particularly of course would say and ask ""I want to go to Australia one day, where should I go?"" Now I travelled around the coast of Aus with my parents as an early teen for the whole of 2006 so I have a good idea about Aus places to see. All I could reply was ""How much time would you spend??"" basically saying 1-4 weeks just stick to the east coast to see Sydney and up to Cairns. Any longer and you'll want to hire a camper like most Europeans do here in Aus to literally go on an outback adventure, maybe see the central and west capitals but definitely see things like the great ocean road, Uluru / Ayer's rock, the bungle bungles, the pinnacles, etc etc.

Point is to above (especially if you tl;dr) it's a time factor how to recommend such a big country that lacks good transport other than cars. I know America is just the same, when I took redundancy it was either the USA or Europe but Europe of course is very easy to do without any plan, I just planned my next movements and booked the next night or a week in advance the transport was so easy.

Getting to now where the world looks a bit iffy but somewhat recovered from COVID19, I've kind of on a whim wanted to start looking at a plan to travel coast to coast and maybe Canada as well. I am back in a permanent full time position where I will probably this time only be able to bank up annual leave over many years. The job I took the redundancy from didn't like you to have over 300 hours banked of annual leave and would try to get you to reduce it. That's basically 2 months solid away from work.

So with that in mind:

1. Would Canada be a possible option as well as the US or would it become too tight?
2. Dad said when he was over in the 80's or so he was able to buy a basic second hand car and use that until the end and sell it again. Is this still a viable option? No idea how the paperwork would go for a none resident.
3. Do you personally think you'd get enough sightseeing stops along the way in such a small amount of time? How long do you think you'd need yourself if you had to do it quick but wasn't limited? (if that makes sense, length of time to do what you wanted without dawdling but didn't have to worry about end time)
4. Do you personally think it's worth fitting in destinations you could holiday another time easily reached by plane? As in LA, SF, NYC etc. I'm betting not, but I think it's worth asking your opinion  


To help determine better; things I find interesting:

* National parks etc that are unusual like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, Niagara falls, the valley with the president heads (excuse my current ignorance lol) etc
* Big museums, more into science than history but I'd find a balance
* Possible geology, a town would need to have something big and interesting enough to have me stop (a town here in Aus has some dinosaur bones/prints and that's it, not that interesting to me)
* Not sure otherwise at least at this stage, maybe you could suggest some things?

So, we're yet to finalize the interior design and I'm seeking suggestions from tourists on what they expect, in terms of aesthetic pleasure or convenience. What are things that you've found very useful at hotels/resorts? What ""attention to detail"" from the hotel's side have gotten you excited?

Which would make for a better trip (based on culture, food, architecture, history, beaches/natural beauty etc.) based on your experiences? Any cities worth removing from this last, or swapping out? 

Not really considering Madrid since they'll get the big city vibe in Paris and Barcelona. They'll get the beach in Mallorca, big city in Madrid+Paris. San Sebastian is great for food, however, is it worth skipping Grenada/Sevilla over? Sevilla and Grenada sound like the quintessential charming Spanish cities.

Essentially the main difference of the itineraries below is doing Grenada+Sevilla or San Sebastian and another town/city in northern Spain. We're torn since we've heard great things about all three places.

***Itinerary 1***

\- Fly to Barcelona, 3 days in Barcelona

\- Train to Grenada in AM, then a full day in Grenada

\- Train to Sevilla in AM, then 2 full days in Sevilla

\- Fly to Mallorca, 3 days in Mallorca 

\- Fly to Paris, 3 days in Paris

***Itinerary 2***

\- Fly to Barcelona, 3 days in Barcelona

\- 2 days to take time driving to San Sebastian, then 2 days in San Sebastian (can also fly there and add a day to another city)

\- Fly to Mallorca, 3 days in Mallorca 

\- Fly to Paris, 3 days in Paris

My flight from AMS arrives in LHR at 20:55 at night on April 20th. My flight to TLV doesn't leave LHR until 8:20 in the morning on April 21st. Do I need to go through any sort of passport control when I first arrive at LHR (coming from Amsterdam)?

When I get back to LHR for my next flight (to Israel) will I have to go through passport control? If so, how long does this usually take in the morning?

Is there anywhere at LHR for me to temporarily store my carry-on backpack while I have a fun late night/early morning in London?

Does anyone have any recommendations for fun/interesting things to go do or see in London between the hours of 22:00 and 5:00?

travel,"I turn to this community for great suggestions and advice.

I have a favorite place in the Mexican Riviera and have been 4 times. It is small - some might argue too small - and now I'm thinking I could go elsewhere.   For Dominican Republic: I have only been to Santo Domingo &amp; Playa Boca Chica.   For Puerto Rico: I have been to Vieques which is amazing but somewhat obnoxious to get to (another internal puddle jumper plane).  Belize: I've been to Caye Caulker twice - it's good.   Costa Rica: Puerto Viejo on Caribe side  - also quite nice and chill, however a 6 hour bus ride from San Jose airport.   Panama: San Blas Islands. Very beautiful. I had a great experience on an overnight on a catamaran.  Potential option to go back but it's more of an adventure.  

Looking for another suggestion.

Criteria:

* budget friendly.  Some Caribbean islands are too pricey.  Hostels are fine, or accommodation up to $50 / night.  I am traveling solo.
* easy flight  from NY/DC/Miami. 
* no crazy loud party scene like parts of Tulum (or think Ibiza) 
* possible activities like reef snorkeling or other nature-based excursions. Love cenotes, that's why I keep going back to Mexico. 
* a good beach. This means not a crummy dirty strip of sand, or the beach has riptides (a lot of the Caribe side of Costa Rica when I visited).  Prefer soft sand and calm turquoise water  Also not fun: the entire beach is occupied by large hotels or resorts and no public access unless you're a paying guest... ugh.

Hope to see some great advice!   Thanks in advance.

I've been travelling for many years and have experience and knowledge travelling many different types of countries (India, Laos, Italy, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka... etc).

My name is McDonald (not actually, but very similar). On my passport, it is listed as Mc Donald, with a space in the middle. I flew internationally in 2019 with my passport spelled like this, and I was listed as McDonald as my ticket, with no issues. I never even noticed that it had a space until now.

However, I have a flight coming up in 5 days with my ticket name as McDonald. My TSA pre-check used the passport spelling of my name, Mc Donald, even though I did not have a space in my name on the application. I was able to add the KTN with no issues to my reservation, but I am wondering if this extra space will cause any issues at the airport? I tried calling TSA, and they were no help at all. I got a generic ""we cannot tell you for certain if it will cause issues or not. Please make sure all your legal document names are consistent."" So, to summarize how it is spelled on each document:

Passport: Mc Donald

Precheck: Mc Donald

State ID: McDonald

Airline ticket: McDonald

Should I leave it as is and hope for the best? Should I call the airline and ask them to add a space in the middle for consistency?

This might be a long shot, but I figured I‚Äôd ask. My wife and I have been planning a trip to Iceland over the summer for our 10 year anniversary. Super stoked! Anyways, we know somebody that would also like to do a house swap with us over the summer. We are in Southern California, they are in Ireland. At first, we thought it would be super easy to add on another week in Ireland since we are already in Iceland. Turns out, not so much. We happened to book non-refundable tickets with Icelandair. We can change the flights for a fee (about $600 total) + the difference in cost for each flight (about $1200 total). Plus we would need round trip flights to Ireland because we would need to fly out of Iceland again (about $1000 total). What we thought would be an easy addition, looks like it would be a few thousands bucks. Anyways, thought I would throw it to the group to see if anyone had insights that we had not thought of.",Extending Trip with Non-Refundable Flights,,xstoopkidx,,0,2023-03-22 18:24:50

I'm not too fussed about wanting a jam packed vacation with activities, I'm fine with a slower paced getaway with nice sights to see, beaches and wine.

travel,"Just saw several posts of people dunking on tipping culture in the US but they really do not understand the concept of how it works and why and the goal of it. In this post I will explain it so people can gain a better understanding. I am a restaurant owner fyi.

First and foremost, the minimum wage in Indiana, and most of US, is 7.25/hour. For an average employee of mine like a chef or regular staff, in today's time you cannot get around paying under $14. Inflation is that high and people value their time and money. For a server in Indiana, the cash minimum wage is $2.13, yet every business I know of pays roughly $4-4.50 for servers. Taxes consist of FICA (social security and medicare), SUTA (state unemployment) and FUTA(federal unemployment. The business and employee each pay these. For the business and individual, FICA is the same at 7.65% of the gross wages. Different than SUTA and FUTA where the business pays a set percentage .5% for FUTA, limit 7,000 per employee ($42 per employee), and states differ. The employee then pays Federal which is based on the amount, marital status, and dependants, state and county tax, resulting in the net check. US average amount taken out of the gross check is 15.3% in total. With this being said, am employee earning 4 bucks an hour is less takes than the one making 15. 

This will be basic guidelines going forward.

The goal of tipping: There are a lot here. Main goals consist of encouraging better customer service, cheaper food cost for the business which then goes to the customer, and representation of customer satisfaction. If a server knows they can make a lot of money from tips, they will generally be better at their job resulting in better customer service. 99% of servers make more than $15/hour. Cheaper price for food is because if I were to hire all my employees at $15, I definitely couldn't stay afloat with the prices I have now, resulting in higher prices which then go to you, the customer. The net result is the same. 

Example time. Employee making $15 per hour gross is taking home on average 12.64 per hour. (15 X 15.5%). 15 - 2.36. Meanwhile the company pays the $15 + 7.65% + 15 which equals 16.15. Servers do not pay tax on tips upfront. The business however, does as it is part of their gross income. A typical server can do roughly 4-5 tables per hour with an average bill being around $50. A low 15% tip equals 7.50. If server does 4 tables, that average is $30 in tips + $4 wage which is $34 dollars. Server will pay the tax on the $30 of tips at end of year when filing tax return, and the business only pays taxes on the $4 wage. Taking taxes out, employee is left with roughly $29 per hour, which is much better than $15, all because of the tips. The average tip in the US is now close to 20%, I used 15% as an example. 

Because me, the business owner, pays the server less upfront, I am able to charge less on the food. Tipping SHOULD be a win-win for everyone: lower food costs for customer, higher income for servers and less expensive for employers, AND higher customer satisfaction due to better service.

This falls apart when....

Some people do not tip, resulting in loss of income when the server did perfectly fine. Maybe a foreign traveler to the US doesn't understand tipping culture and does not tip. Maybe the server got blamed for a kitchen mistake and customer did not tip because of it. MOST businesses do not share tips as a motivation for all employees to work for their own money. The businesses that share tips do not do as well in customer satisfaction. Maybe it is a slow day and an employee only has on average 2 tables an hour, resulting in under $15 per hour. Rare, but it happens. 

For my business, I pay all server employees $6/ hour to encourage good customer service, which does work, and enough to break even with regular employees should they only have 1 table an hour.

travel,"My wife and I have talked about going to Europe for years now but because she is a resident her schedule is very tight and only this year did the stars align for her first ever (brief) trip to Europe. She really wants to see Paris and also wants to see Tuscany and Rome. I've been to all three places at least a couple of times and enjoyed them but generally speaking when I go back to Europe I try to make a conscious effort to balance time spent in urban areas vs ""off the beaten path"" (IMO Tuscany might be a nice balance vs the hectic nature of Paris and Rome in this regard). While I go back to Europe plenty, I've never gone during late May so I hope somebody could offer me some feedback on my \*tentative\* plans.  


We are will be in Europe for a full 12 days, arriving into Paris on 5/22 in the morning and departing Paris on 6/3 at noon. My plan is currently Paris 5/22-5/26 (making an effort to visit Versailles), then fly to Zurich for the weekend 5/26-5/28 (possibly visit Lucerne or Interlaken for a day?). Then take a train to Florence the in the afternoon on 5/28 and see the surrounding Tuscan countryside. Leave for Rome 5/31 real early on a train and depart Rome the evening of 6/2 for Paris.  


As it stands I feel like I'm trying to do too much. I'm the type of traveler who doesn't really ""vacation"" well because I always am trying to see/do as much as I can in my time off and (probably do to my ADHD) have trouble kicking my feet up and relaxing. My wife, in part due to her busy job, enjoys taking it a little slower. With this in mind, would you nix/extend any of these locations? As it comes to Paris, I know we are there for a while. I was considering taking a day trip to Bruges or possible a 2 day trip to Amsterdam.

travel,"Long story short, I have two passports - China and Canada. I'm currently going to uni in Australia with a student visa on my Chinese passport. I am planning to travel to New Zealand next month with my Canadian passport since Canada is a visa waiver country and I don't wanna spend couple hundred bucks on NZ visa application if using my Chinese passport (plus it will take 2 months). 

Problem is, I entered Australia with my Chinese passport (cuz it has student visa), so can I use my Canadian passport to book the flight ticket to and enter NZ, that is, only showing my Canadian passport on the way to NZ. And when I come back to Australia, I only use and show my Chinese passport (to fly and enter Australia). I don't know if this is doable cuz I have never done it. The ultimate issue from what I see is that, when exiting a countries, the custom officer will see a completely different passport than I entered the country with. For example when leaving Australia, the customs will see me use Canadian passport, however I used my Chinese passport to come to Aus, so there's no record of entry on my Canadian passport in the Aus's system. Will they question if I have snuck into the country in the first place? Same goes for NZ, will they catch me cuz I used a brand new passport they have never seen before to leave the country? Especially if they stamp my passport both on the way in and out of the country to keep a record.

travel,"Hi there!

I'm from Hong Kong, thinking about a trip to Turkey and the Middle East during Christmas period. I would likely spend 2-3 weeks there.

Which countries and cities do you recommend the most for a history nerd and admirer of architecture both ancient and modern?

I've done a bit of basic research. For Turkey, I would likely spend 5 days in Istanbul and 2-3 days in Antalya. But I'm not sure about Izmir and Selcuk.

I'm interested in Egypt, but not MUST GO interested, and Reddit is doing its hardest to discourage me from going there. Besides, I'm a solo traveler who isn't used to group travel and having a guide, which is recommended by the people here?

I'm highly interested in Israel, but it seems it can only be reached from Istanbul. I'm also not sure about its safety, particularly in Jerusalem. Google says it's very safe, but online articles have the reputation of painting everything in sunshine and rainbows.

I would really like to spend a weekend in Morocco during my exchange year, so I'm planing on taking the ferry from Spain to Morocco. But here's the thing: The only valid passport I have is my brand new American passport that I got from the US consulate in Germany last summer. I do have a valid German ID card though. 

So my plan is to, before boarding the ferry in Spain, show my US passport to Spanish border officials, then show it again to the Moroccan officials once I'm on the ferry (yes, they actually stamp your passports during the ferry trip), spend my weekend in Morocco, once again show my US passport to Moroccan officials on the ferry back to Spain and, once I've arrived to Spain, show my German ID to Spanish officials. 

Is that how it's supposed to be done? I'm not sure what to show Spanish border officials at the very beginning, before boarding the ferry to Morocco. My US passport (which I've never used before and is unstamped) or my German ID? In other words, I don't know if a EU citizen can leave the EU with a non-EU passport. I mean, I understand if I left Germany, I would need to leave the country using my German passport/ID, but in this case I'm leaving Spain, so maybe my US passport would work? I'm just afraid they look at my US passport and think ""It's completely unstamped, how did you get to Europe then??"" and that my German ID wouldn't work either.

I've spent literal hours looking for answers online and even used Bing's GPT-4 engine but I find absolutely nothing because my case seems a bit special, I suppose. I wouldn't even know whom I would need to ask these things, that's why I'm asking here.

I'm especially looking for places in McLeod Ganj, Rishikesh, Varanasi, and Bodh Gaya.

**Day 12-15:** drive down and explore the southern Israel, spending a night in Jericho, a day/night doing a Bedouin tent stay, a day in Hebron/night in Masada, and a day in Bethlehem before driving to Jerusalem to return the car there and spend the night there

She knows a Texas version of Spanish and we love the culture, food and architecture. Not only that it is also one of the more affordable options.

We both picked a favorite location and we will be planning our trip around that. I picked Granada to see Alhambra and Moorish history and she picked Barcelona for the architecture.

I've explained to her that an itinerary like this would most likely involve skipping Madrid which is a hard pill to swallow.

I need help with what else to skip.


Day 1-3

The itinerary I had in mind involves flying into Barcelona in the morning and visiting the city center when we get there. Then explore for the next two full days.  

Day 4-8 Andalusia 

Here's where the question marks pop up. 

Day 4. We could fly into Seville in the morning which would give us the afternoon to explore. 

Day 5 Explore more of Seville

Day 6 Rent a car and drive to Ronda. Then arrive in Granada.

Day 7 Explore Alhambra.

Day 8 Arrive in Malaga and relax before flying out.

Andalusia feels rushed to me and I feel like we would need to adjust ouritinerary. I've thought about skipping Ronda on Day 6 and instead of renting a car, train hopping from Seville to Cordoba for a day trip then hopping on a train to Granada that evening. But we would have our luggage with us while exploring Cordoba. At least with a rental we can leave or luggage in the car.

I know everyone says to avoid a rental car but they said the same thing when we went to Yucatan MX and we love having the freedom.

The thing is that this year, it looks like I won‚Äôt be able to travel at the same rate as before since acommodation prices in Europe have skyrocketed. My Airbnb has history since 2015. and my booking account since 2014. so I could compare all the prices and it is carzy.

Nowdays my average night costs around 100 euro for two people, in 2019. it used to cost me 50-60 euro for the same accommodation, not to mention earlier years when you could sleep 7 days for less than 300 euros without any problems in places such as ibis hotel or some other place like that which now cost hundereds of euros.

Airline tickets are a nightmare for me too, before I always got tickets for 10-30 euros one way in europe and now they are 2-3 times more expensive (although it‚Äôs possible to find cheap ones here and there) 

My trip to Jakarta was 400 roundtrip from Budapest which is now 1000+ euros, I really cant plan anything more and it is making me anxious even to think about travel, it used to be cheap and everyone could do it if they just spent some more time on the internet.

Sites like secretflying and fly4free provided 10+ cheap tickets per day and now you can only fly to USA for same prices as before where acommodation is even more expensive than in Europe and I need a visa so it doesnt seem that I will visit it anytime soon.

The thing that freaks me out the most is seeing people who never traveled before pandemic visit all of my favorite places and dream destinations which I could afford only few months ago and now it is not possible because of prices. What I mean is that I can actually go to fewer places and days just because I dont want to pay 200 eur for a ticket that used to cost 30, it just doesnt make sense to me.

I have traveled a lot even during the pandemic and it was the best time of my life since every price was even cheaper than before, I just can‚Äôt afford same destinations and lengths of stay as before‚Ä¶

I would appreciate if anyone can share personal experiences. I‚Äôll fly like 13 hours in total with layovers. And the same thing back home too. I will stay at my destination for like 8 days though.
