TravelHacks,"Note: I am NOT referring to hidden city ticketing. 

There used to be a service called FlightFox that I used a few years ago and they kept find inga way to reduce costs on roundtrip flights by adding a 3rd leg.   
For example I needed to fly from EWR to FRA and back direct. I wanted to fly outbound on Jun 20 and return on Jul 2, non-stop only. What they suggested was to add 3rd leg to fly from EWR to SJO on Jul 8th (6 days after my return), and it would reduce the overall cost by 50%, compared to just booking round trip the days I needed. After I returned, I called United to say I couldn't make my last leg, and they even refunded the taxes for that leg.  
They've even been able to find ways to add a completely unrelated flight to reduce costs, e.g. instead of adding EWR to SJO, they might add UIO to SJO as an example.

My question is, does anyone have any idea how they were able to figure out what to add as a 3rd leg to reduce the price? Thanks!",Adding legs to reduce cost,,Lambo_J,,0,4/2/2023 0:22

TravelHacks,"tl;dr at bottom for top 3 of each category

I took a 16 day European trip with my wife from U.S.A through England, France, and Germany and back to U.S. But in Germany we had to stay longer as strikes cancelled my plane and could not get out till days later.

What I bought

just before the trip. While I’m not happy that I bought so much for a trip. A lot came in very handy and some obviously won’t have to purchase again.

These are listed in most useful at top to least useful at the bottom.

1. Vessi Everyday Moves shoes. Man for me personally I can’t give these shoes enough credit. They saved my feet so much through all the walking we did. It makes me rethink my work shoes. After work the bottom of my feet will be sore and kill me. But these shoes I never had feet that hurt, yes, my calves did, but not my feet. Also my feet stayed dry as it rained for about 14 of the 16 days we originally planned. Link: \[https://vessi.com/products/mens-everyday-move-onyx-black\](https://vessi.com/products/mens-everyday-move-onyx-black)

2. Rain jacket. Yeah I never had a rain jacket. Sure I have umbrella’s but where I live it only rains maybe 100 days of the year. So I just need an umbrella. The rain jacket was so nice to have as I didn’t have to juggle an umbrella in crowded touristy areas. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CPLW4L3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CPLW4L3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

3. Airalo Esim. I bought a regional Airalo esim that worked all over Europe for the 16 days a 5gb is perfect as long as your not doing a lot of wireless calling or video calling. It was easy to install and I have done it for Mexico before and will continue to buy in the future. Link: \[https://www.airalo.com\](https://www.airalo.com)

4. 1 Lightweight water repellent travel chino pants. I wear blue jeans all the time and have for the past 28 years. But I needed something more lightweight as I was trying to keep 15lbs and under in my carryon for Singapore air. These pants are amazing. The are comfy, a tad stretchy, quick drying, water repellent, and have zippers on the back pockets that have a small flap over them to better conceal and another “hidden” pocket on the side of the leg. I am definitely buying more. Link: \[https://a.co/d/bRfsuBN\](https://a.co/d/bRfsuBN)

5. A universal plug adapter. Was definitely useful as it had 4 usb plugs + type C and works for US, EU, UK, and AUS. Would be nice to have a second one. Maybe more of a dumb one in case of electronics malfunction. link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095BJFBW9?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095BJFBW9?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

6. A 10L sling bag for personal item. I wanted a personal item bag that would fit on pretty much every single airline as best as I could. My bag is 9.84” x 3.9” x 15.4”. I like the sling as I could easily swing it around to my chest and easily grab my water bottle for quick drinks. The second best part of the size was it fit under the small space under the seat of the ICE train as well. The other nice part was when I was carrying it around in the Louvre my shoulder was getting sore and I can easily change the strap to go over a different shoulder. I like this bag. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GSTM8G8?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GSTM8G8?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

7. A luggage scale. While I didn’t have to do carryon only. I wanted to and the airline Singapore like a few others restrict a carryon to 15lbs. So I bought one and knew exactly how much my carryon and personal item weighed. I also brought it with me on the trip. So when I fly back I can rearrange things that I bought (I also packed an extra bag in my carryon as well). Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0822GDHYJ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0822GDHYJ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

8. A new sleep mask. So I have bought a couple before hand but never found one that I really liked. The first one was a sleep mask with a outward mold for the eyes so your eyelashes/eyelids don’t tough the mask. But the straps on these would hurt my ears. So I bought one that was super soft and fully covered ears as well but it had no eye mold. Then I found one that has the eye mold and the strap doesn’t hurt my ears. So I’m happy with this one. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R558RLV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R558RLV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

9. Selfie stick/tripod. I bought this specifically for Paris and England. So my wife and I could take shots of us in front of major tourist attractions without handing our phone to a stranger and then them running off with it. Definitely came in handy. If you are anti selfie stick bring/buy a disposable camera just for the photos that you want taken of you in front of an attraction. This way they are less likely to steal it. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K5QVJV3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K5QVJV3?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

10. Laundry detergent paper sheets. Yes this is laundry detergent that is like a paper sheet. You just tear off how much you need depending on if a light load or normal. This was nice as some of the Airbnb or the hotel we stayed at either had no laundry soap or only gave us 1. Some of the washers in Europe were so small that we had to do multiple loads (even though we didn’t bring much). So this was nice to have. There are many it there this is just the one we bought because of a sale. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B81BPZNS?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B81BPZNS?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

11. A small clear travel pouch for toiletries. I wanted a small pouch just for some long haul plane essentials. In this pouch I had a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss picks, moisturizer, deodorant, ear plugs, travel size body wash, and a couple cough drops (if needed). I was trying to find a particular size and I looked up clear pencil case pouches and found this park of four. I like it because it fits in my personal bag right next to my Beats over the ear headphones and my wife’s Vera Bradley tech case perfectly (I measured Before hand) Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098NVNWYX?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098NVNWYX?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

12. Compression socks. Don’t know if they were necessary but my wife needed some as she is pregnant and the doctor suggested them. So we found a pack of six and wore them on our long haul red eye flight. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F1LJPNN?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F1LJPNN?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

13. 1 ft 90° iPhone cords. Usually when I go on vacation I bring some 6’ iPhone cords so we can charge our phones by the bedside. But they can be too long when we’re out day tripping. So I wanted some short cords. Also my wife makes her fanny pack as her purse and there is a slot for her phone. But the phone won’t fit in with a regular cord as it has to be angled. So I got some 90° ones and have been really nice. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916VZJJ1?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0916VZJJ1?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

14. Travel camping clothesline. I bought this in case if the Airbnb’s didn’t have a drying rack as some didn’t have dryers or the drying racks were not substantial enough. We used it once maybe twice. Was fine except a bit awkward to adhere it to something in an apartment that won’t break what it’s attached to because of the weight. We’ll see if this gets used again. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QKYGTT?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074QKYGTT?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

15. Apple air tag. These were a Christmas gift, but we wanted some for travel in case we had to check our carryon luggage or if we brought checked luggage on this European trip (we didn’t check bags). But I put one in my carryon and one in my wifes. I slid mine in a zipper pocket in the back of my carryon to better conceal it. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

16. Travel floss pick case. Okay so these were the least necessary item on the list. It was just nice to have a case for floss picks and not having them jumbled in a bag. But hey it’s getting used and I can put more in. If I want to put the ones in there that I regularly buy and not the ones designed for the case. I may need to sand down a piece of plastic inside the case to fit my usual generic ones. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PV3539R?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PV3539R?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

What I ought

These are things that I should buy or consider on a future trip.

17. Travel insurance. For international trips and to cover what my travel credit card may not.

18. Vessi shoes for my wife. Her bottom of feet were hurting even with new gel insoles. My feet did not hurt with the Vessi’s I bought. Will be buying her a pair.

19. A packable waterproof backpack for my wife. We found out my wife’s current daypack is not waterproof.

20. A new raincoat for my wife that actually is waterproof

21. A waterproof backpack cover. Like a shower cap but for your luggage. We found out my wife’s packable day pack was not waterproof. Which got me thinking what if we were caught in the rain with our carryons. How would or clothes be protected if it was a hard rain and can’t get under shelter. Think I will be buying these and keep them with the bags. Link: \[https://a.co/d/5KyYFx7\](https://a.co/d/5KyYFx7)

22. A second but maybe “dumb” universal plug adapter. Link: \[https://a.co/d/gKDA6r8\](https://a.co/d/gKDA6r8)

23. An umbrella. We didn’t pack this due to constraints with weight and space. Though we did have rain jackets, until my wife’s jacket started ripping. We bought an umbrella in Paris.

24. Portable fan. While it was 40°F - 50°F in all the places we went. Most didn’t have air conditioning and it was still pretty warm at night where you toss and turn a couple times. Would have been nice to have.

25. More cough drops. I only brought just one single one as an emergency. Well near the end of our trip my wife needed some and 1 was not enough. Maybe I would do 4 but no more. We did buy a pack when we could.

26. More blister bandaids. We had 4 of them and used them up already. I would like to try a rule of 2 per person plus 2 more.

27. My quick dry towel which is a swim chamois. I had bought this for my Kauai trip as I like to wear rash guards and bathing suits so I can jump in the water any time and easily dry off. This little towel while small really soaks up water! But since it rained like 14 days of this trip it would have been nice to have so that I could wipe the water off a bench and sit down to enjoy a pastry with my wife or just sit and not in water. What actually I did was took off my rain jacket and laid it on the bench for my wife to sit. While I got a bit cold. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742R14NQ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742R14NQ?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

What I brought

Obviously what I packed for the trip but the list below does not include what I bought just before the trip. These are in order of most used at the beginning to the least used at the end.

Electronics

28. 2 power banks + cords. We use the smaller form factor power bank when out and about, but will use the bigger one on flights or at the airport. Bigger power bank Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MBQPV91?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MBQPV91?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share) smaller power bank link (does not come with wall adapter): \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXMF52C?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXMF52C?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

29. Three 6’ iphone cords (two for phones, 1 extra for TV adapter)

30. 1 iPhone to TV adapter + hdmi cable. I like having this so I can watch my favorite shows from my phone to the TV. Why not just a chromecast? Well I can’t chromecast my downloaded videos if wifi is spotty to the chromecast. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009WHV3BM?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009WHV3BM?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

31. Phone holder for flights. This was a nice upgrade from the flat foldable but only sits on a flat surface phone holder. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T8KL6C6?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T8KL6C6?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

32. Headphone splitter + 3.5mm to lightning cable converter plus 2 old wired apple earbuds. This way my wife and I can watch videos together that I downloaded on my phone.

33. Old beats noise cancelling over the ear headphones.

34. Travel power strip. This was a Christmas gift a while ago. Good if an outlet is to far from the bed or not enough wall outlets. Link: \[https://a.co/d/4tGSVkT\](https://a.co/d/4tGSVkT)

Extras

35. Refillable water bottle. I have a Travel Kodi cup that is similar to a Yeti.

36. Ear plugs (for the plane, but good thing I had them for an Airbnb in London as you could hear the road noise a bit to well.

37. Charles Schwab debit card. I got this because it refunds ATM fees worldwide and it’s another account that I can keep extra money in and if it ever gets compromised my main account at a different bank won’t be messed with.

38. A packable day backpack. This has been nice to take on day trips when I don’t want to unpack my personal item bag to go somewhere or to have another bag if we bought to much. Link: \[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D373JGV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share\](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D373JGV?ref=ppx\_pop\_mob\_ap\_share)

39. 2 travel Kleenex packs. Runny noses and more.

40. Nail trimmer and clipper kit. Came in handy for when having a hang nail or a nail broke even though I clipped them before the trip.

41. Ibuprofen + melatonin. Many countries you cannot get ibuprofen over the counter. So good to bring your own. I always carry any pills in their original box (I do not like putting them in these travel pill cases.

42. Swimsuit (use for Baden Baden spa)

43. Moisturizing cream. For the plane trip with the dry air and during my trip if needed. Maybe get a solid lotion bar like this. So it does not count against liquids. Link: \[https://a.co/d/gHBFySV\](https://a.co/d/gHBFySV)

44. Face mask. Just in case if I cough on the plane or a confined transportation, or if some business still requires it.

Clothes (for 16 days, turned to be 19 with flight cancellations)

45. 6 underwear and socks

46. 4 t-shirts

47. 3 pants

48. 1 zipper sweater (It’s all about layers and getting those layers off easily.

49. 2 pajamas

50. 1 long sleeve shirt

51. 1 windpants/ lounge pants (did not use)

I have a guitar and a helix processor that I don't wanna sell. It's pretty new, and if I sell now, I will get only half price.

If not the guitar, I at-least wanna take my helix.

Now the question is: 

1) Is it allowed to carry a processor (electronics) in my checked luggage? 

2) How do people carry guitars when they travel for shows?

Please note that its an international flight.

3) I also have a digital piano, I guess its not possible to take it. Is there any way to ship it?

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone, I am planning a trip to Spain for around 21 days from early to late August before I travel to Portugal (late August - September) and spend 21 days there with Porto as my final stop to finally end in Madrid for 4-5 days (mid-September). So, the Spanish trip will be like 25-26 days at the end lol.

I am having issues to find a way to go from Donostía-San Sebastián to Valencia and not pay exorbitant prices.  After Valencia, I am hoping to go Andalucía for 7-8 days. Do you recommend a way to go from and to these places? Below are some of my own travel hacks I found:

1. Night flight from Cologne to Barcelona from Germany with RyanAir.  Will get to Barcelona at 23:59 lol. Flight is booked, and found out that the **cheapest way to fly out of Germany to go to Barcelona is usually from Cologne** and (sometimes) Berlin.
2. Day 1 morning - Day 7 morning: Barcelona for a week, with a day trip to Sitges and maybe Girona (never watched Games of Thrones). Still undecided where else to go for a day trip. Recommendations kindly appreciated!
3. Day 7 morning - Day 13/14 morning: Basque Country.  I found a **\~18 EUR Renfe train from Barcelona to Bilbao!** ( I am quite a tripster, so I would like to spend time in Basque Country after being in the more touristy Barcelona.  Ideally 7 days in Basque Country but if anyone in here thinks 6 or 5 even days is enough, please let me know in the comments.  My final stop in Basque will be Donostía-San Sebastián for sure with a still undecided place to go in between Bilbao and Donostía-San Sebastián.
4. Day 13/14 morning: Train/bus from Donostía-San Sebastián to Valencia.  Trip is apparently 8-9 hours! Would it be too much? One bus company forbids food in the bus. I am thinking of flying but I am flying too much already in this trip… Australia to Frankfurt via East Asia, Cologne-Barcelona, Madrid to Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Australia… it’s a lot! So, I was thinking of catching the train from Donostía-San Sebastián to Zaragoza and stay the night there and then go to Valencia the next day.
5. Day 14/15 - 16/17: Valencia.  Is three days too much? I am only going because everyone goes there to be honest. I would end up in Valencia in mid-August. Heard the weather in August there will be more bearable compared to Andalucía, especially Sevilla.
6. Day 16/17 - Day 22/23: Valencia to Granada. Stay there for 2 days, then Córdoba (2 days) and finally Sevilla (3 days).  Either Sevilla or the beach town of Cádiz will be my final stop before I go to the Algrave for a week. Though I could potentially reduce it to 5 days and those 2 days to Coimbra and Porto.
7. Train/bus from Porto to Madrid. Stay in Madrid for 4-5 nights. Fly from Madrid to Frankfurt next day and from there back home.

Any tips on how to get out of Donostía-San Sebastián or even back to Bilbao to go to Valencia in mid-August will be appreciated. Unless it is best to skip Valencia this time around and fly straight to Andalucía (Sevilla most likely)?

Hi all!

I am rapidly planning my Germany-Spain-Portugal trip, with the German and Portuguese parts of the trip being increasingly easy to plan. But I am having a hard time about planning my August and September trip to Spain.  I was wondering if this trip plan is feasable.  I am not counting the arrival night in Spain and the departure day from Spain to Germany and then home:

(Already booked) Night flight from Cologne to Barcelona from Germany. Stay the night in Barcelona.

1. Day 1-6: Catch a morning/afternoon train/bus from Barcelona to Donostia-San Sebastian. Stay in Basque Country for 5 nights; mostly in Donostia-San Sebastian and Bilbao but open for suggestions if feasible.
2. Day 6: Catch a train/bus to Barcelona. Stay in Barcelona and surrounding places for 7 days.
3. Day 13: Head to Valencia. Stay for 2 nights.
4. Day 16-21: Go to Andalucia (Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada, Jaen(?) and Cadiz) for 7 days. Last day in Cadiz. Next day bus to Faro, Portugal. Travel around Portugal for 21 days.
5. Train/bus from Porto to Madrid. Stay in Madrid for 4-5 nights. Fly to Germany the next day and from there back home.

- Totally open on destination! Thinking Greece/Italy?

-I have been to Europe a few times (Spain, Italy, France, Ireland, &amp; Germany) but my partner has never even been on a plane
-trying to stay relatively cheap thinking like &gt;$2500 for accommodations so maybe a cruise? 
-the best part! We have been gifted two plane tickets anywhere in the world so flights are not an issue and don’t add to cost!! 
-we also are thinking we want to open a travel credit card to try and pay for most of it with points if possible. Does anyone have recommendations on which one and how to go about that?

TL;DR — Book a refundable United flight, use the boarding pass to get into the United Lounge, and then cancel your flight for a full refund. 

\-----

Basically, my partner and I were flying Delta with an 8-hour stopover in ATL. We had two United Club passes that we wanted to use, but I had heard that they will ask you for a United flight boarding pass to allow you to enter the lounge. 

To get around this, I purchased the cheapest, refundable, one-way United ticket departing from ATL, and planned to show the boarding pass to get into the lounge before immediately cancelling for a full refund. 

This worked perfectly — I was asked to show my boarding pass to enter the lounge, after which I immediately canceled my ticket. I spent 6 hours in the lounge without any difficulty, and I was given a full refund within 48 hours to my credit card.

Every time I pick up the car, I have a conversation that goes like this.

Agent: ""What coverage would you like for the car?""  
Me: ""I decline coverage and assume all responsibility""  
Agent: ""What's your car insurance?""  
Me: ""I don't have any""  
Agent: ""You can't just go driving around without any coverage then!""  
Me: ""Actually, in our state you are required to offer minimum liability insurance on the car""  
Agent: ""Is that true? I think it only applies when we have possession of the car""

TravelHacks,"A couple of weeks ago I booked a four-night, end of May stay through [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) at a property in Sorrento, Italy. A few days ago we randomly discovered on the confirmation that our reservation was made for 2024, not 2023 (I have no idea how this is possible lol, I've never had this issue when booking a stay at any place). 

The major problem is that the booking is non-refundable. I messaged the property, apologizing profusely for this mistake and asked whether it would be possible for them to cancel the booking and reimburse us. They said that we have to take up the issue with [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), which we did and today [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) messaged us back, saying they contacted the property to request cancellation, but the ""accommodation is unable to make an exception in this case and you will be charged the entire cancellation fee"". 

I'm probably just dumb as heck and deserve blowing €370 down the drain, but I just don't see what the property has to gain by this? When someone books a stay 15 months in advance, the price is obviously much lower (when I checked the dates for the end of May 2023, the price range is around twice as high and it doesn't look like they have problems with occupancy rates either). If I don't cancel, won't they miss out on a larger sum down the road, or? I'm also confused by the property saying that we paid [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), not them - will the money not transfer from the site to the hotel until in May next year? In the end it's a big sum for us and currently it makes more sense just to write the money off and not go on the trip.

5. Athens + another city in Greece, perhaps Mykonos (please give other recommendations)
6. Amsterdam + another city nearby (please give other recommendations)

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone,

I am spending 3 weeks in Germany during July and very early August, with my final 9 days in Leipzig and Cologne.

I am starting to think 9 days might be too many days for both cities combined.  So, I have been thinking of including either Antwerp OR Ghent in between or at the end of those 9 days.  That said, I am flying from Cologne to Barcelona at night.  So, I gotta come back to Cologne anyways.

It looks like Ghent is a little closer to Cologne time wise by train.  So I was wondering if it would be the cheaper option? Antwerp is a bigger city than Ghent, so I guess Ghent could be cheaper overall for a few days.

I am thinking of the following: 3 days in Leipzig, 3 days in Cologne and 3 days in Antwerp/Ghent and come back to Cologne two or three hours before I fly out of Germany from Cologne.

I don't mind missing out on Ghent/Antwerp entirely but I have been reading comments like ""Cologne is depressing"" ""Cologne is boring"" and ""Cologne is enough for two nights"".  My bank is Australian so the exchange rate will not be great even with my Citibank card lol

When I arrived to Canada for a layover flight, it cancelled until the next day (evening). After a 14 hr flight, I politely asked if they had rebooking for the same day, they yelled at me and told me no. I was about to be stranded in Canada for more than a day with my wife and dog, no food for my dog or bathroom for him unless I left through customs. I managed to fight for a flight for the same night after literally running through the whole airport. When I arrived to the US they lost my luggage for 3 days so my Wife and I had no clothes or hygiene products, we borrowed them from my parents. After 3 days and driving back to the airport our brand new suitcases were broken. I called them and asked for compensation for the clothes and products we had to buy, and broken suitcases. They said it’s not their fault their plane was cancelled and gave me a credit for $300. Does Air Canada fall under DOT? I would like to report them to somewhere, maybe the Better Business Bureau.

TravelHacks,"My mom has asked my help for a travel situation of theirs. I am more attuned to hotel and flight deals than car deals, but I of course said I would see what I can do. 

My mom and dad are traveling to Florida this summer, and they would rather not put the mileage and wear and tear on their vehicle. So, they were wanting to rent a vehicle. But not just ANY vehicle. A Toyota or Honda SUV or Van. 

Those aren't exactly easy to come by at rental locations, so we were looking at possibly renting from a dealership with a car rental department. There are a few issues causing difficulty here. (Aside from the inflexibility on car type and make)

1) They don't live in an urban area, so there aren't multiple rental agencies relatively close. They live in a rural area, and the nearest rental places, even dealerships that rent, are like an hour away. This is inconvenient, for a number of reasons. It adds 2 hours of driving time the morning of their trip. It requires 2 people to drive to and from. 

2) They are leaving on Friday and coming back Saturday night. All the rental agencies/dealerships/etc. will almost certainly be closed. Many of the places, but not all, will be closed Sunday as well. So...it's adding essentially 2-3 days of rental fees (depending on how they charge). Those extra days are killers. Even the one extra day takes things from being over their budget but doable to too far outside their budget. 

3) The budget. Their limit is $350....maybe $400, with all the taxes and fees included. I actually miraculously found something for $415. But, they are not willing to take a chance that it might be a car make that they don't care for. 

I am a big fan of Turo and have used it in the past. It's also nice because you can pick the exact vehicle you want. But...it still has the problem of price being higher than the budget, and there is still the issue of needing to travel a good distance to pick up a vehicle. 

Can anyone give me any recommendations, or should I prepare them that...it's not going to happen.",Car rental thorn in my side....help!,,throwawaylastsupper,,0,3/28/2023 1:58

TravelHacks,"I'm (29F) heading off to the UK and Europe later this year for 6 weeks. Doing the basic-bish touristy things like gallavanting around London, Paris, and Munich, as well as a couple of weeks road-tripping and camping with my partner.

Being a typical overpacker, I'd like to keep it as minimal as I can with the number of pieces I bring (including everyday bags, e.g. a handbag) - but I just can't decide on what I should bring.

Rather than straight-up advice, I'd love to know what you guys bring and what your reasons are for your picks. 

For instance, so far I've got:

- a 75cm hard-case as my main luggage (it's a 4-wheeler for easier portability) 
- tossing up between a large backpack or an expandable tote bag as my carry-on (probably the former as I like to keep my hands free for airport/bus station traversing) 
- a smaller backpack and/or a small shoulder bag as my everyday (though I'd be hesitant to bring a second backback if I go with the larger one as my carry-on)","What is your baggage set-up, and why?",,loudspeakr,,0,3/27/2023 4:15

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone!

I am going to Europe for the very first time in my life after so many years of my ""Everybody goes to Europe, I don't want to go"" phase lol. 

My partner is super interested in Hamburg, so we decided to go to Germany first for no more than 2.5-3 weeks, followed by flying/catching the train to Spain (2.5-3 weeks) and then train/bus to Portugal (3 weeks for sure).  I just have no idea if it is cheaper to catch trains and/or buses around Europe compared to flying.  I live in Australia, and the AUD is very weak this year lol.  But I can't go overseas in 2024 or in 2025, so... 

We will be in Europe during the high season (July - September; 72 days).  If it is cheaper to book trains and buses asap, please let me know! The plan is the following:

\- Sydney to Frankfurt with a 17 hrs overnight stop in Seoul (flight booked, accommodation in Hongdae booked).

\- Frankfurt to Hamburg.  We arrive in Frankfurt at 5:40 pm on Sunday 9 July.  Is it best/cheaper/easier to stay the night in Frankfurt and catch the train to Hamburg the next day? Or just catch the train to Hamburg right after we get our bags after customs and etc?

\- Hamburg for \~1 week; Berlin for \~1 week; Leipzig for 4-5 days.  The end.

\- Leipzig to Paris or Central/Southern France or even straight to Basque Country.  I can't seem to find the best way to go to Spain by train or bus from Leipzig.  Unless it is best/cheaper to just fly from Leipzig to Northern Spain?  I don't mind staying in France for a few days.  If so, it seems I would have to stop in Paris, which is not what I planned.  If I can avoid Paris, I am not sure which place would be a good stopover from Leipzig.  I assume Southern France?

\- Spain for 3 weeks.  We would love to start the Spanish part of the trip in Basque Country for 3-5 days (Donostia-San Sebastian and Bilbao), Zaragoza (1 day), Barcelona and small day trips nearby (5-7 days in total), Valencia, Alicante/Almeria, Granada, Cordoba and Sevilla (heard it is super hot in August!) and/or Cadiz.  The end. 

We are Madrid (4-5 days) to the end before we fly to Frankfurt and fly home 8 hrs later.

\- Portugal for 3 weeks.  It looks like it is easy to go from Sevilla/Cadiz to Faro, Portugal by bus.  Flixbus is the cheapest bus company I've found but heard it is quite horrible? We are planning to catch buses and stay in the Algavre region for a whole week (23-29 Aug). Unless that's too long? Aiming at making Faro and Lagos as my two main hubs in the Algavre.  Lisbon and day trips nearby (e.g. Sintra) for a whole week in total.  Coimbra and Porto for a whole week in total.  Are 3 days in Coimbra too long? Read great things about Porto.  The end.

\- Bus/train from Porto to Madrid.  Stay in Madrid for 4-5 days.  

\- 18 Sept in the morning: Fly from Madrid to Frankfurt (flight booked).  Hang around Frankfurt for about 6 hours plus the two hours wait at the airport to come back to Australia.

My favorite option :
Sint-Maarten / Saint-martin. 
Found some 4* for similar price to others destinations ( maybe 100-200$ more than cheaper one) or slightly more for (500$ more)  all included, during my vacations end of summer.

 But flights seem a pain : you lose 1 night  ( say 4 night for a 6 day trip) so either long flight or multiple flight to go there.

Option 2 : 
Miami seem nice choice too.
But no all included and depending on which one lots of extras ( parking, food etc). 

Option 3 : either mexico or dominican republic.

Have some all included. Lots of choice but would not be sure which place to go.

I am trying to book a ticket from US to UK on Iceland Air for end of December into January 2024.

I am only needing the option to get my money back if, for whatever reason, I need to cancel my ticket before then. The basic economy ticket is US$400 and the add on for Cancellation Protection is US$27. However, the little blurb under the checkbox for this states that the cancellation process is for if I fall ill and cannot make the trip. Do I have to prove that I'm sick in order to get my money back?

TravelHacks,"Hey guys, do any of you have recent experience with the following (or similar) itinerary?

First flight: Vienna - Seoul Incheon, operated by Korean Air

Second flight: Seoul Incheon - Tokyo Narita, operated by Jin Air (Codeshares with Korean Air)

Connecting flight also leaves within the same day.

I've purchased this flight on the website of Korean Air within one ticket, so both flights show up within one e-Ticket.

Because on the e-ticket it stated that the second flight is operated by Jin Air, therefore I should use the check-in counter at Terminal 1 at Incheon airport. Because I wasn't sure, whether I have to re-check my baggage at Seoul and go through Immigration and customs, which also means, that I have to apply for K-ETA, I've called the service hotline of Korean Air regarding my itinerary and they said it shouldn't be a problem, I just have to go to the check-in counter for Korean Air at the departure airport (here Vienna) and my checked in baggages will be delivered to the final destination (Tokyo) without rechecking it in Seoul, therefore meaning I don't have to go through immigration and customs.

I also think that this should be fine, I've checked the site from Jin Air regarding this and found the following:[https://help.jinair.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410892058265-Can-my-baggage-be-connected-for-free-when-transferring-to-another-airline-](https://help.jinair.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410892058265-Can-my-baggage-be-connected-for-free-when-transferring-to-another-airline-)

So therefore, I've decided not to apply for K-ETA, but I'm still a little bit unsure, if everything goes according to plan. Therefore, I've like to ask if any of you have any experience regarding this topic. Especially if a re-check of baggage at airport Incheon is required, and I'm denied boarding because I don't have the K-ETA approval.

In addition from what I've gathered, for my return flight, I would go to the check in counter of Jin Air and it should also deliver my baggage to my final destination (Vienna)?

I am planning to move from Vancouver to Montréal and have been looking at prices for a particular AirCanada flight on May 17th. I need to be on this flight, no other options! 

Since my first glimpse about two months ago, the price has increased by $80 CAD.

My current situation is that I have a 20% off coupon that is valid until the end of the day and the total of my flight comes to $410 after taxes, seat selection, airport improvement fees and two checked bags. Before all those additional costs the flight itself would be $250.

The Portable Fresh Juicer Blender is a game changer for anyone looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle on the go. With its compact and portable design, you can take it with you anywhere, whether it's to the gym, work, or out for the day. Plus, it's waterproof and wireless, making it easy to use and clean.

The 1400mAh battery is impressive and can be charged with a USB cable, allowing you to blend up a quick and healthy snack without having to hunt for an outlet. The blending power is also impressive, making smooth and creamy smoothies and juices with ease. And with the ability to control the texture by blending for longer or shorter periods of time, you can customize your drink to your liking.

The only downside is that it's not very large, so you can only make one serving at a time. However, if you're a single person or don't mind making multiple batches, it's not a big deal.

Overall, the Portable Fresh Juicer Blender is a great buy for anyone looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle while on the go. Its portability, waterproof design, and impressive blending power make.

I exhaustedly drove 8 hours home and returned the car at Pearson….I immediately got asked by Budget how the damage to the car had occurred. There on the driver’s side was a fairly significant dent I hadn’t noticed. I was boggled; I had made exactly 2 10-minute stops en route, parked away from others, and had not caused any damage.

Is it an expectation that the rental agent should do this?  Given that car rentals are their job and not mine, I feel like I should have been walked to the car and told to sign off that there was no damage. This was absolutely not done.

TravelHacks,"I know I probably know the answer to this, but I'm hoping someone has an idea/hack I hadn't thought of. 

Son is on a competitive traveling baseball team. Has a tourney in Vegas Easter week. Only husband &amp; son are going this trip. Will need to fly out 5th and will be done early afternoon on the 8th. Flying SW, so bags are free. 

We live less than 15mins to DEN, but COS is about an hours drive each way, so picking them up from there wasn't really an issue. 
Flights home on Sunday to COS were 2-3x cheaper to to DEN. 
Then we saw a flight that has a layover in Denver, then on to COS. I thought, perfect. We'll book the $67 flight home &amp; they can jump off there, at 920pm &amp; then we'll save ourselves the drive. They are only going for 3nights &amp; can easily pack a carry on &amp; back pack for flight home. 
Except....we can't check bats. And my husband is the one who will never ask anyone for help or a favor, even though we are constantly asked &amp; never say no whenever someone needs help, esp to baseball family. 

The thing is, the other 9-10 players will also be flying home that afternoon too. And we will see everyone on Monday, Tuesday for practice. Not really putting anyone out, but again, husband refuses to put himself out there for any sort of help. And these baseball bats are $300-500 each (son will take 2-3). 

Anyone have a hack that I don't know about? How can I get our bags to get off in Denver, if we are supposed to go on to COS? Can you carry on a bat? (I'm pretty sure no, but hey, maybe?)","Getting off at layover, what about bags?",,Emjewels223,,0,3/21/2023 16:15

My friends and I are currently visiting Florida and we're still unsure about how tipping works:

1: When the bill mentions ""20% service fee/tip included"", does that mean we don't have anything to add?

2: When the bill suggests tipping amounts for 10 / 15 / 20%, can we tell the waiter/ress that we want to give xx% so they add it and we pay the entire amount at once?
Last time we told the cashier we wanted to give xx% but it wasn't debited despite her confirming.

3: After paying we get the receipt and a pen, do we write down the base amount, our tip and the total? Or do we enter an amount of additional tip we want to give?

I'm planning on traveling to Nice with a friend this June. 

I am planning on flying from NYC to Nice on June 1st. I would probably stay for a week and leave around the 8th.

Next, I want to visit family in morocco.  I want to fly into Marrakech on the 8th and stay for a week. I would leave on the 15th, take a train to Rabat to visit family for a few days, and fly back from Rabat back home to NYC.

Now, I am wondering what is the cheapest way I can do this.  I do need checked baggage as well, as I will have things to bring and many things to bring back. I am a bit flexible with the dates if there are cheaper dates to fly. I know this trip won't be the cheapest but, I am trying to go for my cheapest options as I still have Airbnb and other costs to consider. 

I am open to other options besides flights in regard to getting from France to morocco. I also don't travel too often so I am wondering what options besides Airbnb are good for short-term rentals. I am open to any other methods of travel.

It was a place that I had rented a room from 2 times before, very small, minimal, and cheap but all I needed was a bathroom and a bed, which it had. Anyway, I had to rush out the morning of my checkout and forgot a pretty large book of collectible cards (football, basketball, baseball, soccer, YuGiOh, Pokémon, magic the gathering, autographs, etc.) worth about $3000-4000. My son and I forgot to take the book out of the car the day I left. I use my vehicle for work and had to empty out anything that was of value or that I wanted to keep safe from being ruined or broken. 
Later that day I tried to contact the owner of the property through text and phone call with the phone number provided on booking.com. This continued for about 4-5 more days with multiple tries to contact per day. I then started sending direct messages to the owner through the booking.com app, still no response. Next, I contacted booking.com customer service through their app chat. Their (pretty quick) response was that the owner was going to check with the cleaning lady to see if she found anything and get back to customer service with an answer. That was 3 days ago, with a total of about 10-11 days since the day I checked out. 
There’s a camera in the “common” area of the home that points directly at the room I was staying in. So I’m sure there would be video showing someone walking out of the room with a book that’s 12x10 and 6 inches thick full of cards.

My vacations have always been tropical: Mexico and cruises because that's what's close and cheap. I go to Mexico at least once a year. I'm Mexican-American btw, and I've never really seen snow or seasons.

Recently I've been to Big Bend, TX. (10 hours away lol) My first time in a national park and damn I loveeed it. I especially loved the freezing nights and the stars. I have never seen the desert before so it also wowed me. It's my second time there and I'm just wondering what other national parks would be like.

So finally I have time to take a gap year. I'm thinking if I should do an epic roadtrip in the US, camping, visiting parks and some cities here and there and experience seasons. I have the car already. Or if I should follow the advice of my friends and go to Southeast Asia, which is also the most popular gap year place I believe.

I honestly can't decide. S.E asia feels like a cultural experience, with a new culture, cuisines, and it's also cheap. But US is an outdoor and adventure experience.

I had had a question for those who have transited through DXB before.

I booked 2 different flights with 36 hours between them. One arrives into DXB and the other departs from DXB onto a third destination the next day. 
I will have to collect my bags after arriving via the first flight and for that I will have to pass through immigration first. 
Both flights are entirely different airlines with no codeshare agreement and different PNR. Did this because the fare I was getting for my final destination was super cheap. Also, visa on arrival is NOT offered for my nationality and my flights are not Etihad or Emirates or any other UAE airlines.

Do you think I did the right thing because I am relying on getting the free transit visa to pass through immigration, collect my bags, sleep in a hotel and then depart again the next day? Will immigration create any problems with this?

TravelHacks,"I’ve rented cars for years (for both leisure and business travel), and luckily never incurred charges for damages until now. I always add the default collision insurance that’s offered when booking via travel websites (for example, Expedia) and also pay with my U.S. Visa credit card, which has collision coverage as well.

On a recent trip, I rented from a Budget car shop in the U.K. They later sent photos and an invoice stating they found a scratch near the front bottom bumper that will cost $650 to repair. I have no recollection of any activities that would have caused this, though they did require me to leave the car on the street outside their facility overnight as part of their after-hours drop-off procedure (therefore, I was not with the car all night or present when they did their final inspection).

That means that you can very often book directly with the hotel on their site or via email, and smart hotels will give you a reduced rate that basically amounts to splitting what would have been the 3rd party commission with you.","Always check direct booking options for Europe hotels - EU forbids strong ""price parity clauses""",,slakmehl,,0,3/16/2023 15:41

TravelHacks,"Have you ever heard of a ""staycation""? It's when you take a break from your daily routine and explore your local area instead of going on a traditional vacation. One great place to do this is in Dubai, a city known for its luxurious hotels and exciting activities.

In a recent blog post, [Sata Travels](https://www.satatravels.com/home) shared their top 10 must-do activities and places to stay for a memorable staycation in Dubai. These recommendations range from relaxing at a beachfront resort to exploring the city's iconic landmarks.

Some of the top activities on the list include taking a ride on the world's fastest roller coaster at Ferrari World, visiting the famous Burj Khalifa observation deck for panoramic views of the city, and experiencing the cultural traditions of the United Arab Emirates at the Dubai Museum.

When it comes to accommodations, Sata Travels suggests checking out some of the city's most luxurious hotels, like the Four Seasons Resort at Jumeirah Beach or the Atlantis, The Palm. But for those on a budget, they also recommend some more affordable options like the Rove Downtown Dubai hotel.

Overall, a [staycation in Dubai](http://blog.satatravels.com/staycation-in-dubai-our-top-10-must-do-activities-and-places-to-stay/?preview_id=1211&amp;preview_nonce=d8b8ebc27d&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=1215) is a great way to experience all the city has to offer without having to travel far from home.

TravelHacks,"Just a reminder that if you buy a ticket through Priceline and the airline cancels the ticket, Priceline cannot and will not guarantee that you will get home without having to buy a new ticket, they are incapable of working with the airline to get the tickets that were sold through Priceline honored, and they allow the airlines to refund only a small fraction of the actual cost of the cancelled ticket. I had tickets from Zagreb  to Seattle on Priceline last July. Lufthansa cancelled the flight because they chose to sell tickets that they did not have the staff to fly. My travel insurance wouldn't pay, because Lufthansa was contractually obligated to get me home. Unfortunately, I had to work with Priceline to rebook - and even though Lufthansa was obligated to rebook, Priceline dropped the ball. I got a refund that was one third of what it cost me to get home (both because the refund did not reflect the higher cost of cities on my return leg and because I was having to buy a last minute ticket). It took me seven months to get an answer from Priceline - which came down to, you are stupid idiot for buying a ticket from us because how could you possibly think we would get you home (paraphrased, but basically their answer was that they were under no obligation to get me home, and refunding a small fraction of the ticket is all that I could expect.) 

Here is the response to stranding me on another continent:  

Upon investigating your case, I can confirm that  there was an involuntary cancellation for the inbound portion of the  flight. To our regret an alternative option could not be offered by the  airline so in such cases we can only raise a refund request for the  unused ticket. 

Allow me to underline that  whenever a flight is canceled, we will endeavor to rebook you on to the  next available flight in the same cabin, but it is always in the matter  of availability. In case the customer was inconveniently assisted, we  want to take the opportunity and apologise for the frustration created.

Thus, we placed a request for a partial refund instead. In response to the query, assistance was provided by the service team. ",Avoid Priceline for airline tickets if you want to get home,,Zhenja92,,0,3/16/2023 2:21

TravelHacks,"Having recently traveled to hotels in south east Asia, and in Europe, where they require you to keep a hotel key card in a power slot to have electricity and air conditioning in the room, I have a little hack to share, if you have more than one room. So you need a minimum of 2 rooms for this hack. It was frustrating to not have power to charge a battery pack while we were not in the room since we had to take the room key. What we found out at almost every single hotel we stayed at, was that the key is universal for the power slot. We had 2 rooms so we would take room key #401 and put it in my room which was room #200. I would then take my #200 room key with me and we would go about our day. So in essence, 1 of the rooms now had power vs none of the rooms having power if we all took our key card with us. When we would return to the hotel, we would go to my room first, since it was the the lower level with the key.

TravelHacks,"I made a huge mistake booking a hotel for an upcoming trip to Tokyo with my two kids. I made a reservation on [booking.com](https://booking.com) for a total of about $3000 for 6 nights in a large chain hotel, which is more than I could afford, but our dates are in high season and almost everything was sold out when I started looking in January. The hotel offered free cancellation until March 3, so I felt safe in having a backup while I looked for something cheaper. Soon after I did find something cheaper, less than $1500 for the same 6 nights, in the same hotel in the same type of room, but on a different travel website. That also offered free cancellation, so I went ahead and booked it. 

Here comes my grave mistake: my son got covid and then I caught it from him and we were both sick and I forgot to cancel the first reservation during the free cancellation period. Today I went on [booking.com](https://booking.com) to do so, and was informed that the cancellation fee is the full price of the trip, i.e. $3000. I asked for them to waive the fee, thinking that it's 3 weeks out, and it's high season so they'll have no problem rebooking the room. They said no. I have the option to cancel the reservation and be charged the entire fee, or to keep the reservation.

I am a single mom who saved up and pinched pennies to be able to take my kids on this trip that we have all dreamed of, so it's not like I can say ""Oh well, I'll cancel the second reservation and just pay an extra $1400 for the exact same room booked on the first reservation."" 

The way I see it, I have two options to try to avoid paying for the more expensive reservation:

1. I cancel the credit card I used for the [booking.com](https://booking.com) reservation, and then cancel the booking and ignore it when they ask for a new card after the charge is declined. Then I show up at the same hotel on the same reservation date and try to check in under the other booking, hoping they haven't made the connection to the failed cancellation.
2. I don't cancel the first booking and just show up at the hotel and try to check in under the second booking, that is already paid for BTW. But will they see two bookings and not allow me to do this, and they will force me to pay for both rooms, or cancel the second booking and keep the money?

I feel angry at myself for not reading the small print when I booked the ""free cancellation/pay when you arrive at the hotel"" room on [booking.com](https://booking.com). I don't travel much and I had absolutely no idea that a hotel would charge me for the full stay when a room is canceled so far in advance. (And, for reasons I cannot understand, the hotel's cancellation policy on the second travel website is a fee of 1 night's charge!) I'm in such a bind now, and I'm going to be losing a lot of sleep over this unless I find a solution.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone, hoping to get some tips and suggestions from folks who’ve traveled this area before as I’m in very early stages of sketching out an itinerary. My partner and I have booked round-trip flights to Paris in late September (I know open jaw would have been better, but this was cheap and it’s already booked). I’m thinking of traveling by train from Paris to Venice, stopping in a few regions along the way, and then flying back to Paris (or the other way around). 


Our wishlist of destinations is too long to fit into two weeks, so opinions on what is a must-do and what is skippable are helpful! Here’s what I’ve got so far:

-A couple days in Paris at the start and end of the trip (total 3-4 days)

-A wine region in France, hopefully involving a vineyard tour and tastings. Open to suggestions, but my partner strongly prefers red wines so I’m thinking a couple days in Dijon (but also looking at Lyon)

-A quick stop in Geneva, since it’s right there anyway (1-2 days?)

-A few days along the coast somewhere. Any suggestions there?? I’m open to anywhere from French Riviera to Cinque Terre

-A few days in the Alps/Dolomites where we can take in the scenery and do some day or half-day hiking. Open to France, Italy, or Switzerland here. Is this achievable without renting a car?

-Lake Como, perhaps? Would that fit into the mountain category above, or is this a separate stop?

-Spend a day or two in Venice before flying back to Paris from there. Feel like we should see it before it’s gone, considering climate change.


Obviously this adds up to more than the 14 days we have on the trip, so some cuts need to be made somewhere. I’d also love some tips on which cities are easily connected by train.

I sent 3 follow up emails, and the last two bounced back as the email address no longer exists.

TravelHacks,"I learned a lot from my experience being involuntarily bumped from a flight today. Thought I would share so others can be prepared in similar circumstances. My husband and I suspected that we were going to be bumped when we weren’t issued a seat number during online check-in. So tip #1 to avoid any chance of being bumped is MAKE SURE YOU ARE ASSIGNED A SEAT at check-in. If you aren’t assigned a seat or are interested in the freebies that comes with voluntary or involuntary bumping, read ahead.


Voluntary Bumping:

Tips for Volunteer Bumping:
1. Don’t just accept the first or second auction offer you hear over the loudspeaker.  The first reason is that they’re going to try to lowball their offer to see if anyone takes the bait. The airline is trying to find the cheapest way to fix the situation (the situation being that they oversold the flight). They’ll typically start saying something like, “The flight is overbooked today. Any volunteers who come up now will be flown out on the next flight and receive a $500 travel voucher.” 

The second reason is because this process WILL cost you a lot of time, and don’t forget to include that time in your mental calculations. Even if a $500 travel voucher and free hotel stay and meal vouchers sounds appealing, remember that you’ll spend longer at the airport dealing with the situation and you’ll probably have to wait for your hotel room to be cleaned before you can check-in, so if you took an early flight you might not be able to fully relax for hours. 

2. Understand that it is, in fact, a negotiation. You can ask for a higher travel voucher, cash offer, more meal vouchers—really whatever you want in the voluntary phase. The worst that can happen is they say no and wait for a different volunteer—and you still make it to your desired destination on time.

3. Be wary of the travel vouchers and ask lots of questions. The vouchers can be notoriously difficult to cash in. Make sure you confirm it will be good for both weekends and blackout dates. Also, if you book another trip just to use it before it expires, you’re likely spending more than you made by volunteering. That’s why my husband and I were in full agreement that if we were involuntarily bumped (which we were), we wanted cash instead of a voucher.

4. Most importantly - especially if you are traveling during a popular holiday - make sure they GUARANTEE you’ll be seated on the next flight and don’t leave until your seat number has been issued. We met one poor soul who agreed to fly standby in her voluntary negotiations, but because the destination was a popular one for spring break, every single flight for the past two days had been fully booked and she was still at the airport.

5. Expect the unexpected. When we received our hotel voucher, the airline sent too many passengers to the same hotel. There were no rooms left for a few people in line, and the only advice they were given was to return to the airport and get a different hotel voucher. Needless to say, those folks were understandably quite upset.

6. Meal vouchers are lower than average restaurant prices. We received four meal vouchers for $12 each meant to last us two days. Not terrible, but also not the amount I was expecting.



Tips for Involuntary Bumping:
1. Know the law - both its pros and cons. 

Pros: you can get cash instead of a travel voucher. You are entitled to 400% of the ticket price or $1550, whichever is LOWER. 

Cons: The cash may be all you get, meaning the airline may not be able to get you on a future flight if it is a particularly popular destination. Luckily for us, we were very polite and understanding with our ticket agent so she worked hard to get us a flight two days later — but the law does technically absolve the airline of its rebooking responsibility. 

2. Expect to have to advocate for yourself. The airline will still try to push a travel voucher on “invols “ instead of cash, so you have to make it clear that you know what you are entitled to.

3. Cash takes longer to get than a travel voucher. Once we asked for cash, we had to walk to a different part of the terminal and wait in a rebooking line until a supervisor could give us debit cards. It added another hour of waiting in lines.

4. If you notice no one accepting the voluntary bumping offers and suspect that you will be involuntarily bumped, go up to the counter ASAP to begin the conversation. Your bargaining power is at its highest before the flight closes. You may find the travel voucher amount more appealing than the 400% value of your ticket if, say, it’s a cheap connecting flight that you’re missing.

I'm traveling across several cities in April and May. I’d like to have a consistent checklist of things that will help me explore each of the different cities. So far it’s things like: drink their famous drink, use 3 modes of transportation, eat their famous food, find a mural/sculpture/public art, visit their tallest building, attend a live event. 
I kinda think these ideas are a lil boring though. What creative, fun and more whimsical kind of ideas might you all have? If you’ve made a checklist for your own multi city travels, what were your favorite things on the list? 

Other things I’m curious about:
Any good travel mantras, mottoes etc? What phrases or affirmations do any of you use while traveling to help you remember to embrace the chaos, smell the roses etc?

What kinds of routines do you use while the landscape and people around you are changing but you’re a creature of comfort who is pushing themself via travel? 

What is a small, lightweight, reasonable, cute, quirky thing to look for in each city to bring back as a souvenir? Some ppl collect shot glasses or magnets from their travels and that’s just not me. 

A few details if its helpful: I’ll be solo traveling in the north east in VT and PA, then in the south, AL and LA and I’m traveling to each city by train.

This works out because I'm more interested in active travels like hiking, and I've been looking at getting into cycling as well.

I came across The Natural Adventure and Mac's Adventure and like their business style. Solo travel is possible over varying lengths of time. It's also possible to get it stripped down so you're getting a room and a rented bike for a week and almost nothing more, so there's a lot of independence possible at a low price point.

Additionally, any tips on renting a bike in one location and returning in another - are there any regional, national, or international bike carriers that operate similarly to a rental car company where you could pick up in one city and return in another at the end of your trip (say, pick up in Bordeaux, return in Toulouse).

I have been told that my butt is slightly larger than average or that it is bigger than average (my ex boyfriend said I had a big one.) I’m black pics in comments 

I have grown up in a city that is 42% white 31% Asian, and have always lived here. My ex boyfriend in junior year was black and average looking, overweight. The relationship failed.

I am technically introverted. I intend to start at community college and don’t know what I’ll major in. I will admit to dealing w internalized racism and that I am indeed most likely a colorist. I have enjoyed watching after black kids the most (I babysat, without prompt, my cousins who I met for the first time on our family vacation to Michigan in summer 2021, and really enjoyed working w the kids - specifically the little black kids - on my last day as an intern at a camp in summer 2022. My youngest cousin was a boy who was about to turn 3.) 3 out of 4 people voted “child development” on my poll where I asked what major will likely work best for me, a few days ago (I asked what you think will work best if you’ve spent time around me.)

I am from a low income family. We live in an apartment complex. My older brother is in rehab, and I feel some guilt over how he’s turned out. I have learned this year that I really like reading (I recently finished “IT” by Stephen King and actually have a post about that over on r/books - by recently, I mean a few hours ago.)

I am more involved in my EC’s this year, which the facilitator of an extracurricular I’m in actually pointed out today. I don’t know what I think I’ll actually major in.

I will likely eventually start taking antidepressants. I am attracted to some of the black and white men I see daily.

I asked this on Instagram and there’s one vote for “black” (from an Asian girl) and one for “white” (from a white guy who I called cute like a yr ago.)

A friend told me he bought domestic r/t tickets on Frontier airlines (US)online thru their website. Then someone informed them that they can go to the airport and buy the same flights at a cheaper price from their counter.
He did not believe that but then thought of going to airport to try it out.
He was able to buy the same flight tickets for about $80 cheaper each r/t and they were 3 ppl, so saved $250 nearly!!

The person who informed my friend said that he knew someone who stayed near the airport who bought tickets this way always and hence good to try if you stay nearer the airport.

TravelHacks,"Long story short i'm looking at needing to extend and keep my rental car for 6 weeks. This would be expensive. 

However, some research that Hertz apparently also offers a monthly rental subscription program for $999 per month, insurance included. This would save me a lot of money. The problem is that, for some reason, this program seems to be obscure, not advertised, hard to find, and you also need to be 25. 

I'm 23.75. I've rented three vehicles with Hertz without giving them any problems, I have an AAA card (which apparently is the only reason I was able to rent an SUV under 25? never knew that until some guy asked for my card last time.) 

Additionally, my most recent rental car from Hertz had a major problem. I made a left turn into traffic and the entire passenger side front CV axle, bottom ball-joint, and lower tie-rod came clean off. The car was stuck between two lanes of busy traffic for over an hour, the police were called, I had to pay for a tow that I'm still awaiting reimbursement for, and Hertz had to deliver a new vehicle the next da while I stored their debunk ford edge in my s/o's family's apartment's parking lot, where it wasn't even allowed to be. 

Like, at this point, would it be ridiculous or unfeasible to ask them to do me a solid and allow me to get enrolled in this despite not being 25 yet?",would it be possible for Hertz to make an exception?,,acp3500,,0,3/9/2023 16:33

TravelHacks,"I want to move to a state w higher black population that doesn’t have high crime rates 

I’m almost 18. I actually had to turn off IT: Part One (2017) yesterday because I was already feeling sad (I actually read the book and finished it two days ago which is part of why I had plans to rewatch it) but also bc it reminded me of middle school and got me thinking about how different everything is now. I remember that in middle school, I saw IT (2017) twice in theaters - once w my father, the other time w a girl who I don’t hang around anymore. I remember I watched sharp objects after and was rlly into the film and felt to be one of the best horror movies I’d ever seen. But even though I liked it this time (and didn’t finish, but will rewatch Friday) I was still just thinking about how I can’t “relate” to the characters anymore. And comparing it to the novel. 

I’ve changed a lot since the pandemic started. I’m no longer super obsessed w one specific decade. I am also always quite tired and am noticing that a love of reading has replaced my interest in watching films and tv all the time like I did in middle school. I have made a new acquaintance and had my first boyfriend (maybe only one who knows) last yr as a junior

I have been reflecting for maybe the last hour on just… idk, I guess the loss of my youth? Now that I’m getting closer to graduating from high school (I think - I had some drama earlier this school yr like in regards to a few things I actually did a while ago off campus and notice the body language of the staff of my school has changed around me and was wondering if maybe they’ve talked over the idea of potentially holding me back from graduating) I feel kind of anxious. I mean, it feels good, bc a part of me seeks freedom after graduating - the kind of freedom that you obviously don’t have when you’re in school, the freedom to decide on what you hope to do with your life and on how you’ll be spending your time - but I’m also worried abt becoming an adult and just… well, just how my brother is in rehab and how my parents are so unhealthy (and getting older all the time) 

I think I’d like to move, even though I’ve lived in this city for all of my life. It’s a thought that crosses my mind a fair amount. I don’t feel like I “belong” in this city. There aren’t many people who are the same race as me, and it’s safe but I just don’t think it’s the kind of place I want to spend my adult life in. I think I want to eventually start a family, I want to move somewhere that’s less expensive (I know that I’m not typing this in a super formal way.) 

The only people who voted on my latest Instagram poll voted “yes” when I asked if I seem like a bookworm (I posted my book review of “IT” to my account and am really surprised that I have started to enjoy reading as much as I have. It’s just fun, getting lost in the world of a book and learning new terms along the way. Books are actually a lot more entertaining than television.) 

I was bothered earlier today when thinking abt how much things have changed.

The facilitator of an EC I am in pointed out to me today that I am a lot more consistent abt the extracurricular this yr/semester than I was last yr. 

I generally feel kind of nervous when talking to other people but have general anxiety and probably social anxiety too. 

Now that I haven’t been able to replace my silent reading book with another story for my English course (my English teacher had me as third on her list of ppl to talk to for some reason. I remember some part of me was wondering if maybe she was going in order of her favorites or smthn.) I noticed that since I don’t have anything to read, I actually got back into my old love of watching films/tv tonight even though my love of reading has replaced my love of film this month. 

When I graduate, I really don’t want to be stressed out. I want to find smthn that works for me but also doesn’t stress me out

TravelHacks,"1. **Become A House-Sitter -** If you can manage a few responsibilities, which is looking after someone else’s home (especially pets, plants etc.) while they travel away on vacation or for business. This is a unique way to travel as it features free accommodation, while feeling like a local, plus a lot of more benefits.
2. **Get the foreign money before you leave -** Never exchange money at the airport, too much high rates. Still you see so many people line up to exchange money at airports, even if they promise zero commission, they provide poor exchange value.
3. **Subscribe to hotel newsletters -** Most hotels chains have a newsletter to keep their customers engaged &amp; periodically offer out various types of discounts or offers to entice customers. This is different from signing up / subscribing for your OTA. With a little luck &amp; monitoring periodically, you should come across on an offer that is lower than that of what is being offered online.
4. **Use Less Popular Booking Sites -** The same flight, hotel, place, will cost different different websites. Especially on less popular websites. Try to take advantage of them.
5. **City travel card** \- A humble city travel card can give you access to local transport services, discounts on train, subway tickets to museum fees. Some even offer more added benefits like events, exhibitions, shopping, if you do some research.
6. **8-Week Rule For Flights** \- Studies have suggested that a 6-8 week window before a trip is when the tickets are at the lowest. This is where a big chunk of your money goes, besides  accommodation.
7. **Haggle -** shopping in the local markets, Ask the nearby local person for help, for what an appropriate price is supposed. Maintain a fun, easy going attitude. If the shopkeeper takes a personal liking for you, you’ll definitely get your price.

I’m interested to know which one’s have you tried so far.

Considering that most flights are $400-800, these deals are pretty good.  The rates are usually for two adults and they give you the option to extend the trip.  How would you go about booking these deals if you are traveling with kids?  Would you just call the company to customize the trip and add the flight portion for the kids?  

I’m kind of curious to see how this works because sometimes they are able to get prices down from government subsidies and other items they just offer deals through partnerships.

As our family grows flights are now a big portion of our travel expense and lodging isn’t significantly more until the kids are older.

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone, I've seen a few posts asking about global entry but my question is a little more specific so I thought I should ask.  
My parents and I are thinking of applying for global entry, we are all mexican citizens but travel to the US anywhere from 2 to 5 times a year so we feel like it is probably worth getting it, however my mom is worried because she was detained while going through customs in IAH around 13 years ago, they were looking for someone with a similar name to my mom, they questioned my mom for about 3 hours, accusing her of traveling to a place she had never been to and tried to get her to confess something she did not even do until they called another officer who reviewed the wanted person's profile a second time and realized the only thing that matched with my mom was her name, everything else including nationality, height, skin color etc was completely different and only then did they let her go, after this we had no problem until 2013 when we were going through customs in LAX and for some reason the officer thought she was traveling alone and tried to sent her for another screening until a flight attendant from our flight heard them and told them she wasn't alone and then in 2018 when another customs officer sent her for an additional interview while going through customs in IAH, they did not ask her anything this time except where she was going to and then let her go.  
We have no clue why this happened again, I assume whoever accused her of being the wanted person did not completely cleared up her profile and sometimes it gets flagged.  
When she went to renew her visa last year the interviewer asked her if she knew another woman by a similar name or if she had used a similar name before (think my mom's name is ""Grace Craig"" and the woman they were looking for is ""Grace Crain"") my mom said no and that was it, the interviewer said okay and approved her visa renewal.

TravelHacks,"Looking for advice to plan a trip to Central Europe.  Either last week of February to third week in March vs last week in October to third week in November.  Countries and cities to visit: Germany (Berlin, Nuremberg, Munich), Poland (Warsaw, Łódź, Krakow), Hungary (Budapest), Austria (Vienna),  Czech (Praha), Slovakia (Bratislava).  I’m open to other cities. Even cutting back others, or maybe extending travel time. 

Transport will be rail trips and comparing city to city ticket prices vs Eurailpass.  I know there are pros and cons. Since I’m finally considered a “senior”, there are discounts on rail passes. Looking at three star hotels vs AirBnB vs pensions. I’ve found out youth hostels charge more for a single private room than a three star hotel. 

Main reason for travel, well, I’m finally retiring and am a total history nerd. Focus is on WWI and WWII and Jewish memorial sites. Yes, I know many WWI sites are found in Western Europe, and I’ve seen some on previous trips.  

Home airport is PIT. Is it a bad idea to take the BA direct flight PIT-LHR, and then just Eurostar it to AMS and then rail to Germany, or better to fly into FRA from JFK/EWR/IAD?  There are night sleeper trains from AMS to Berlin.

TravelHacks,"Every time i've rented a car I've always purchased the Allianz added coverage at the end of the booking (I book through carrentalsavers) because it's much cheaper than the agency's LDW insurance and seems to cover everything. 

This time though, I landed in a snowstorm, and the guy at the counter said something about that third party insurance not being valid in this country or something. I honestly don't remember what exactly he said, but in the moment having to make a split-second decision with a fuck ton of snow on the road, I decided it was worth it to risk getting scammed. He also mentioned that two cars he'd rented that day had been in accidents had been returned, which also seems kind of salesman like now that I think about it in retrospect. 

The rental location was at the Montreal airport in Quebec. Does anyone know if that's true at all, or if the LDW insurance was legitimately needed? And if so, how can I cancel my allianz insurance policy?

On a side note, later this same day I was making a routine left turn in this 2022 ford edge platinum and the passenger side CV axle, bottom ball joint, and tie-rod all came straight out. We were stuck in the middle of the road for an hour, I had to pay for a tow, and Hertz delivered a replacement the next day thankfully.

TravelHacks,"Hey fellow Redditors!

I recently came back from an epic backpacking trip around Asia, and let me tell you, it was incredible! The food, the culture, the scenery - it was all amazing. But there was one thing that kept bugging me throughout my travels: internet censorship.

Whether it was trying to access my favorite streaming services or staying in touch with my friends and family back home, it seemed like every country had its own set of online restrictions. That's when I decided to try out a VPN - and it was a game-changer.

If you're a fellow traveler, or even just someone who cares about online privacy and security, here are five reasons why you need a VPN in your life:

1. Access Your Favorite Websites Anywhere: With a VPN, you can bypass internet censorship and access any website or service you want, no matter where you are. Whether you're trying to watch Netflix in a country where it's blocked or accessing a social media platform that's banned, a VPN will get you there.
2. Stay Safe on Public Wi-Fi: We've all been there - you're at a coffee shop or airport, and the only available Wi-Fi network is unsecured. With a VPN, you can encrypt your internet connection and protect yourself from hackers and other online threats.
3. Get Better Deals on Flights and Hotels: Did you know that some airlines and hotels offer different prices based on your location? By using a VPN to change your location, you can find better deals and save money on your travels.
4. Avoid Geo-Restrictions: Certain content, like TV shows and movies, are only available in certain regions. With a VPN, you can change your virtual location and access that content no matter where you are in the world.
5. Protect Your Privacy: Finally, using a VPN is a great way to protect your online privacy. By masking your online activity and location, you can avoid targeted ads and other invasive practices that compromise your privacy.

So there you have it - five great reasons to start using a VPN today. Trust me, it'll make your travels (and online life in general) so much easier and more secure. I found this [**Community Website**](https://www.vpngrades.com) on Reddit with that latest discount codes from different providers.

My flight from Portland Oregon lands at CDG in Paris at about 10:45am. My next flight through a different airline that I bought as a separate ticket leaves at 7pm.  

I get my checked bag and pay for my checked bag and carry on to be in luggage storage for 6 hours.  
I take the metro into the heart of Paris where I then go to the Eiffel Tower for a summit tour with elevator access. I haven't bought the tour ticket yet, but I'm thinking a 1pm or 130pm time. Would 1230pm be pushing it?  
Well, I do the tour for 3 hours max. I know I'll have to wait at some point for the elevator but it will just be me so I'll squeeze in if I have to.  
  
  
I leave and head to CDG by 4pm. I've read that it takes about an hour on the metro. I'm not paying extra for taxis/Uber.  
If I get my bags at say 5pm, would I make it to board my 7pm flight?  
Is luggage storage before or after the point where I would check my bag?  
Since my night flight is an independent ticket, I'll have to go through the gate agents and such again, I'm sure. Will 2 hours be enough? My night flight is from Paris to Djerba Island, Tunisia.

Our destination preferences are pretty broad since he’s never been to Europe before (other than not wanting to be cold), but top of our list are Spain, Italy, Greece, Croatia, Portugal, or France. 

I’m seeing direct RT flights to Milan on Neos (which I’m not familiar with) for just under $500 right now, although we’d have to only bring carry-ons and leave on a Sunday instead of Saturday, giving us one less day of vacation. 

Would you jump on these flights, or give it another month or two and see what deals pop up? I’m subscribed to a bunch of the flight deal emails lists (doing the $1 year of Dollar Flight Club premium and have the free subscription to several others) and have Google flight alerts set up for a few of the major hubs (Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Athens, Paris) for dates we like. 

On one hand, I feel like there’s good odds that a deal will pop up. On the other hand, I don’t like having nothing to plan/look forward to, and I worry that prices will explode and we won’t end up going (the fall travel dates are already a budget concession, as the original idea was to travel for my milestone bday in July, so I really don’t want to push it further).",Book okay flights now or wait for a great deal?,,RagingClitGasm,,0,3/2/2023 22:39

Thought they might have increased prices due to a lot of people checking their sites, so decided to leave it for 3 days and check again in incognito. Tosay the prices rose even higher.

Do you guys think the prices will eventually decrease when I leave it be, or should I book asap?

Thanks!",Flight prices keep increasing,,Driewieler123,,0,3/1/2023 20:21
TravelHacks,"Im just getting into the rewards card game. I have watched a few videos and read a lot of articles, but I still do not know what is best for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I fly once or twice per year, I'm hoping to fly more once I'm more settled into my career. I'm a grad student in Orlando, so a lot of my vacations only involve booking a hotel around the resorts, not flying. But it doesn't seem like many travel rewards cards, Chase/Cap1, offer much for hotels and focus much more on flights. (Im looking at Chase Preferred because I have great credit, but not enough history)

So Im wondering, should I just get a Chase Preferred, and deal with their hotel rewards, or should I get a separate Hotel Credit Card (I havent done too much research on them tbh) and use that soley for hotels, while Chase is for flights/dining/other travel stuff?

I live in Australia, and the Marriott Hotel im looking at through expedia has a package option for 5 night hotel stay + flights return for only $2500. 

However, when i look at booking Just a hotel, not through a package, its $3200?

Why and How are the packages so cheap when they include flights? 

And when booking a room at this hotel through a package, rooms with less features are more expensive? the room i’ve chosen, which is $0 extra, comes with free breakfast and lunch, hotel shuttle, wifi etc, however a room that costs $475 more doesn’t even include a hotel shuttle and Only has dinner for 2 each night?

can someone please explain how the package options work through Expedia, and how they are so cheap?

These people are either refugees or people who have been discarded in the system and they hang around these locations intending to ask for help but they're running along corner some sort of!

**Translation:

I travel to some countries that have very low visa requirements (i.e. no visa required or they have easy entry  for countries with a large outward bound population or an official refugee program via UNHCR). This is not a hack but I'm warning you of an issue. These countries tend to have more issues with people hanging around hotels and shopping malls trying to con or scam you. It's particularly bad in one country that starts with a capital M. These people are either refugees (Syrian, Rohingya and possibly Russian now seems common) or people who have been discarded in the system (but not bums - legitimate travelers I think who overstay because they can't or don't want to return home due to conflict) and they hang around these locations intending to ask for help I think.

More context: on multiple occasions in the XXX hotel at the actual fucking lobby in XXX I've been confront by small families or single guys on a scam of some sort.  It starts simple ""Oh where is the shopping mall?"" and then rapidly segue into highly personal questions and eventually an ask.  I wish the hotels would shut this down.  I have COMPLETE sympathy for these people as the UNHCR or the countries immigration dept is completely broken and these people are allowed into M and T but given no real support and end up basically begging.    These people are not economic refugees or illegal workers - they're allowed in but often not permitted to engage in official work.

It's all a bit muddy and I'm really not being racist - my rant really is with the system and the conflicts that drive these people out their homes.  As a traveller keep this in mind when traveling to countries with low barriers of entry if you cannot deal with this (I can, but my mother can't). I think there are two countries starting with M that are particularly overloaded with refugees due to easy entry now.**

We recently got back home from Florida via Air Canada. Our flight (which cost $500 per person, by the way), was supposed to land in YYZ at 8pm. We intentionally paid extra for the straight flight as we were traveling with our 22 month old son.  

The flight got delayed twice, and a third time after boarding. The pilot flat out explained they were having staffing issues, fueling issues and technical difficulties from a previous flight. 

We ended up with a 6.5 hour delay. Landed in YYZ at 2:11am. 

It gets worse...

We wait by baggage claim for 45 minutes until we hear on the PA system that all FLL to YYZ baggage has been unloaded. Our luggage was nowhere to be found, along with about 100 other passengers baggage. 

It's now 3 am and we're told to line up at AC customer service to get a lost baggage form. Another 1 hour wait. 

We finally left the airport at 4:45 am (park n fly didn't show up for almost an hour). 


Is there any way we can get compensated for this disaster? A partial refund perhaps? We still don't know where our suitcase is.

TravelHacks,"Next month we are flying from New Zealand to Ireland. We have done this journey many times before and despite multiple different approaches to dealing with the jet lag we never seem to crack the best approach to managing it most effectively. 

We are only really concerned about outbound jet lag and are not too bothered by how we feel on our return. This particular journey has approx 32 hrs travel time give or take. Longer than our usual travel time, with 2 stops instead of one (Auckland to Dublin via Melbourne and Abu Dhabi) 

Usually we stay awake once we hit Dublin, eat, drink copious amounts of tea and walk outside plenty. Falling into bed (nearly dead) at about 8pm. The issue is we always wake in the night and then are up at 5am every day of our holiday barely making it until 9pm before we flake. This specific flight has us arriving into Dublin at 8am which presents additional challenges...

Do we take a nap on arrival or will that make it worse? What can we do prior to leaving that'll make it easier to adjust? Have you got any tried and true techniques for tackling heavy duty jet lag? 

NB - no we can't extend our transit time and sleep in an airport hotel.

TravelHacks,"Okay, so looking for reasonably priced destinations. Ideally it’s somewhere scenic that feels upscale/luxury, but is moderately priced. We don’t see a traditional wedding in store for us. Instead our vision is a trip with friends and family.

A location with hotels that have luxury/upscale vibes for around $200 or less per night OR for ~$350/night but there are decent hotels for under $200 too.
Example: Dubrovnik, Croatia with beautiful views and you can stay at a beautiful hotel like the Rixos for ~$145/night.

Ideal features:

• Scenic/Picturesque: landscape or architecture 

• Weather: moderate to warm weather destination. Sunny.

• Near the ocean - this is a plus, but certainly not a requirement.

• Good food 

• Good nightlife or culture that knows how to celebrate(like Argentina or Mexico)

• Location: North/South/Central America or Europe

• Convenience: a plus if it’s near a major airport, but I don’t want to limit ideas. Onsite activities or nearby things to do (a city or plenty of excursions).

• we’ll probably invite around 100, but we’d expect less to come.

TravelHacks," I have been travelling for years as a minimalist traveler and my life fits in a 24L bag.  
Over the years I have learned plenty of tips, tricks and hacks and here are just a few. I always love sharing, so if you have any questions or would like to learn more about minimalist travel please feel free to ask.  
I'm really passionate about seeing the world and experiencing what this planet has to offer in terms of communities, food and culture. But more importantly, I love hearing people's stories and experiences.

Either way here are the tips, Hope they help :)  


1. Get a backpack with a harness system to take the weight off your shoulders
2. Get a waterproof bag to protect it from the weather.
3. Bring a power bank to keep your smartphones/digitals charged when you’re on the go
4. Pack Black – One pair of black jeans, 3 black T’s will get you through a long trip.
5. Find a pair of workout shoes which can also be casual walking and touring attire.
6. You can get by on “Five of Each” (5 pairs socks, 5 undershirts, 5 underwear etc) almost in definitively.
7. Once every 3 months, take EVERYTHING out of your bag. Challenge everything. When was the last time you touched it or used it on a trip? Throw it away or leave it at home if you will not need it overseas.
8. Wear the thicker jeans and the heavier jacket along with the bulkier shoes in the flight!
9. Pack for the right season
10. You can find cheaper, yet comfortable accommodations for your travels. Look for [hostels ](https://hostelworld.com/)or budget-friendly guesthouses which you can find on [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com/).
11. Knowing a few basics about the language, culture or traditions of the place you are visiting will make it easier for you to navigate and interact with locals.

Hope it helps and if you would like some more tips you can check out the link below. Either way If you have any questions let me know :)

Many of you may know about this already but I’ll add it for those that don’t. If your flight gets cancelled and you don’t want to wait you can grab a rental car to drive to your destination if it’s within a reasonable distance. However if all or most of the flights are canceled you’re not going to be able to rent a car to drive there because 5000 other people have beat you to the punch. Tell the rental car company that it’s for in town use and you’ll be returning it there. They still have cars but they’re worried about inventory abd don’t want to keep as many as possible. Drive your car to your destination and tell them you changed your mind. It’s a lot cheaper than getting a room (if you can find one) and a lot more pleasant than sleeping in a crowded airport. Not to mention you get there a day earlier.

I watched this [video](https://youtu.be/UkmcDafXNzA) on YouTube from Sadhguru which gives some useful tips on handling jet lag and stress while travelling. He travels very often and shared some tips that are based on the science of yoga. I've gone ahead and summarized the points for you all:

Eating right can reduce travel stress

* When you are especially crossing time zones, consume food substance with very high water content like fruits and fresh vegetables
* Consume as much pure water as possible before, during, and after your journey (try to consume within 24 hours after reaching)
* During this period, avoid intoxicants and stimulants like alcohol and caffeine. Avoid food substance that stay in your stomach bag for more than 3 hours like red meat, complex mixtures of carbohydrates and fats, and deep fried foods. 

Practices to reduce spinal stress (helps greatly with jet lag)

* Once you are in a different time zone, get some sunlight exposure especially with your back facing the sun for a minimum of 20 minutes, 2-3 times a day
* And practice [upa-yoga](https://youtu.be/QjGF2MLdIz8)

These tips can help get rid of jet lag quickly. Do try them and see the difference.

TravelHacks,"This is a collection of my top strategies to save money, fly smart and meet people, while also being practical and relatively easy. Most of these apply for long haul international flights where I as an Australian living in Melbourne am quite far from a lot of countries.

I would love some feedback, new ideas and if you tried any and how it went :)

# Pre Booking

* Fly between the largest possible hub airports, more airlines competing == lower fares. Taking a train 3-6 hour once you arrive for $20 is better than a more ‘convenient’ flight for $200 more. This site shows what connected airports are biggest: [https://www.flightconnections.com/](https://www.flightconnections.com/)
* Let flight deals dictate your travel plans, flights are often the most expensive aspect. You  could save over $1k if you travel based on deals instead of wanting to go to specific place at a specific time
* Look at flights way ahead of time but when you’re planning to book, as you do, flights get ‘hotter’, try and wait a day after you concluded your search so prices ‘cool down’
* Use a cheap old android phone in incognito mode to search flights and prices. Searching on a high end MacBook sometimes gets you higher fares, especially when booking directly with airlines
* Statistically the cheapest time to book is 64 days before desired departure
* Don't bring a checked bag for ultimate savings and airport convenience. Also, no lost bag
* Churn a credit card to save $500+ on a flight with travel points. Many credit cards offer a 1 year sign up for free, bonus signup points and include travel insurance
* If flying 10+ hours, deliberately choose a flight with the longest layover possible, bonus if you'd arrive in the stopover country late in the afternoon. You'll be able to get a much better sleep in a hotel in the stopover country, in addition to saving bucket loads on the flight. You can also leverage stopover to ’tick off’ other countries/places you'd otherwise not visit
* Some excellent dates to fly out is on Christmas or New year's days early in the morning. Bonus, try to fly to countries that don't celebrate the same holidays as yours so you get a holiday aligned with your work break but you don't pay through the nose on the place you're going. E.g do easter in China, or Australia Day in New Zealand
* Try to travel when your local state has public holidays, this reduces the leave you need to take. My favourite time is between Easter and Australian Anzac Day because a lot of countries don't have days off for then so they often aren't more expensive AND it's not school holidays, but you also get 3 free days of leave
* December is always expensive to fly. Try to either depart on one of the last days of November or return on one of the first days of January
* If you get all the way through the flight booking process and it tells you prices have increased so “go back and start again”. Give it at least 24 hours before retrying. Sometimes even a week if you can be patient, let prices ‘cool down’
* A lot of marketplaces have people selling flight vouchers and credits, often if you're planning to book at the same time you find a seller and you tell them you'll book immediately they'll discount you more (upto and beyond 30%) where you can also validate the credit works along side them.
* Always check the weather for the month in the place you're planning to book. E.g A tropical island in monsoon season is often worse than not going at all. My biggest tip is travel to places when they're experiencing their best weather
* Find good flights on third party sites, note the dates and airline, wait a day then use the airlines site directly. It's often a few dozen dollars cheaper
* If you're searching for flights on the month “view”, often when you click a departure date you'll see a lot return dates that aren't populated eg ?  
 With only a few good ones, this is to incentivise you to book a specific period that's best for the airline. To take advantage, pick some departure dates close to when you'd like to return and notice the best return flights that actually load. Now pick a better earlier departure date, if the return day you want has changed to a ?  
If you click it anyway and search, you'll find it's the same price.
* If travelling with one other person and you feel like getting a row to yourselves. Book the window and the aisle, the single ‘’between” seats are last to get filled. If someone does take it, it's usually easy to swap them for the window or aisle, if not then one of you gets the floor and the other gets the row of seats, have a nice sleep!
* If you want to visit multiple countries in one big trip, book a return from home to country A, then another return from country A to country B ($). This will save about 30% rather than doing home &gt; A &gt; B &gt; home ($$$). Also you'll get to “taste test” country A. Better still, book home &gt; country A city A, then travel to country A city B and do a return to country B ($$)
* The far right seat at the back center of the plane where it decreases from 4 to 3 has the most space and doesn't cost much extra. You can put your leg way out and it wont get bumped by passers by or the trolley  
   
 

# Flights

* Ensure you're the last on the flight and then go into the bathroom, wait until they tell you to get out and pick whatever seat you want on the plane - everyone should be seated by then
* Wear a pride wrist band on each sleeve to potentially get both arm rests on the flight, works when seated next to men
* Laptops are heavy, when checking in, put it inside the back of your pants under your shirt. Once your bags have been weighed, put it back in your bag. This also works if they weigh at the boarding gate
* Bring an empty water bottle, most airports have filling fountains
* Wear your heaviest clothes on you on the plane, you aren’t weighed
* Airport Chappell's are the quietest place to be, good for a sleep
* Never exchange cash at an airport FX converter. The best place is a bank, second best is an ATM. With ATMs, always decline it to do the fx conversion, your bank will do it for you at a better rate automatically
* If you want to bring a second carry on bag, bring one that's a modest size. At the duty free area, buy the cheapest thing you can like a pack of tim tams and then ask for a duty free bag. Put your second carry on inside it. Most airlines allow a bonus duty free bag in addition to one carry on
* Put a napkin between your phone and your phone case sticking out on one side, put that side in the tray table locking mechanism with the tray up for a simple phone holder
* Alternatively, Use a selfie stick to hold your phone for movies on a flight in a much higher and more ergonomic position, allowing you to better lean back, saving your neck
* Don't watch shows with short episodes or play games with short arcady levels. You'll check the clock everytime you finish one and it'll make time drag on. Watch long movies, play endless games or my favorite: be productive on something that gets you ‘’in the zone” like coding, reading or writing  
 

# Hotels

* Get a hotel with an included buffet, eat like crazy and take as much food away as possible. Also, do this as late into the breakfast period as you can to feel full for as much of the day as you can - don't do this at little hotels, only chains for ethical reasons
* Random hotel lobbies have the cleanest bathrooms - Just act like you booked a room
* Get an inflatable ergonomic pillow, you'll never have neck pain from bad hotel/hostels pillows. Tip: Only inflate it about half way for best softness
* Don't get a universal charger. If you don't travel a lot you'll lose it or lose an important piece of it. I think it's best to get a singular adapter designed for the destination countries plug for each trip and just keep a collection. They are simpler, lighter and often more reliable
* If you have to cancel a hotel reservation but it's not free anymore, ask to rebook it later. Then cancel
* Confirm stay and arrivals times with hotels a few days beforehand, it prevents your room being overbooked and you being stranded. Further, be really nice and ask if you could get a free upgrade

# Backpacking

* Bring two phones. I like to film/take photos with my nicer phone but doing so drains the battery a lot, this leads me to bring a battery bank and cables which is a pain. A second (usually old or cheap) phone can be what you use for maps, texting, travel sim and itinerary so you'll often end the day with both phones on 50% charge. Bonus tip, bring a tiny 10cm USB C-C cable and both phones can charge each other so you don't need a battery bank at all
* Get a passport travel wallet that opens with the fold on the shorter side so you can fit notes and boarding passes without needing to fold them up awkwardly
* Instead of a thick raincoat, bring a ‘’single use’ poncho. You can totally use these dozens of times on a single trip
* If you wear sandals, you don't need to pack any socks
* Merrino wool shirts only need to be washed every 4 days max if you're heavily sweating, less if you’re not. They also dry super fast after a rinse in the sink with soapy water. You could easily do a 2 week trip with 3 shirts and only washing one once
* Add mini carabiners to any loops on the outside of your bag, then you can attach anything that itself has a loop so you don't need to carry it
* Get a foldable water bottle, as it empties it takes up less space. Get a good one otherwise the water will taste awful
* Get a 65w + GaN charger - They’re tiny but a little expensive
* Bring a lightweight thin bag with drawer strings for dirty washing. Keep it seperate from your clean clothes, it’ll take almost no space when empty and they’re less noisy than plastic bags which hostels bunmates will be thankful for
* NoDoz is a capsule caffeine tablet that gives great energy and will dramatically improve your mood when you're tired
* Ear buds take up a lot less space than headphones on a flight and the noise cancelling is usually ‘good enough’
* Work remotely 3 days a week while travelling if you’re allowed. You'll appreciate those 3 “rest days” and become more attuned to the area you’re staying while also planning your busier days closer to when you'll actually do them. You also retain 3/5ths of an income and only use up 2/5th of your annual leave
* If staying in a hostel, cook for everyone! It's fun to get some randoms together to go ingredient shopping, especially if none of you know the language, it becomes a real mission. Then while cooking people will be stoked to socialise with you, they'll be grateful and often return the favour
* Taking photos or videos on a phone that automatically backs up with google photos or iCloud is way better than needing to offload an SD card and manually do it yourself every day off of a camera. Also your phone adds metadata that makes searching for moments easier. Bonus, you can make albums for specific people and after a trip, send it to them so they have all their photos of themselves from you in one place

### Misc.

* If you're planning to take a ride share app to/from the airport. Check it regularly before you actually need to go and track the prices. Likely you'll see it double and halve as demand grows and shrinks. Work out what “cheap” is and once you see it, tap “schedule in advance” for a time you’ll be ready to go
* Keep a digital copy of all your documents, tickets, passport, visas, hotels on your phone in a locally saved folder
* Always have an airtag in each bag you're travelling with
* Download maps of the areas you'll travel in advance. So that even if you don't have a Sim you still get GPS, also sometimes the downloaded map will have a detailed floorpan of the airport
* Download the local language on google translate in advance too
* Hydralyte tablets and gastro stop will make short work of any food poisoning
* Bring some basic colored string to braid friendahip bracelets for people you meet
* If travelling in less developed countries, the biggest source of illness is bad water. Don't consume ice, sliced fruit or meat. Opt for vegan food in hot boiling wateror steamed and or go for reputable chains to avoid getting sick. Sneaky tip, eat places where you see kids and crows lined up, parents usually put a lot of work into ensuring their kids won't get sick so they’ve done the work for you.

This is not so much for destinations where the cost of living is pretty low (i.e. SE Asia etc) but more for places in Europe like Portugal.

Hostels even seem pretty expensive for 2-3 month stays. So far I've seen a lot of luxury co-working/DN spaces, but no 'no frills' apartments with good internet which get the job done.

However, I cannot ever for the life of me seem to find cheap flights... I have tried different booking sites, airlines direct, and I always see flights that are 300+ dollars MINIMUM last second (normally its 600+).

I would rather bank on having a cheap flight since the lodging in the area might be booked out the door for whatever reason. I don't want to be double whammied on this.

TravelHacks,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Our schedules finally matched, so my husband and I plan to vacation in the last weeks of March. We decided to take that honeymoon trip we'd postponed for the previous three years because of all those pandemic restrictions. We chose to take a trip to Thailand, which our friends have raved about, sharing their extraordinary experiences and eagerness to return. 

&amp;#x200B;

While certain about our destination, we had doubts about whether to use a travel agency or go on a solo trip. To be honest, I'm a bit of a coward when it comes to trying new things, and I prefer to minimize any potential risks before doing something. So I'm more inclined to use a travel agency that would take care of everything for us. I'd feel more comfortable with the security and insurance that a travel agency could provide.

&amp;#x200B;

But my husband is the opposite and believes solo travel would be cheaper than buying an agency tour. Besides, it'll offer an opportunity to immerse ourselves in the local culture and have a true adventure. He has even done some research and found affordable options for flat rentals and renting a vehicle on Thailand classifieds. According to him, 2K should cover all our needs for ten days and even allow us to buy souvenirs for our relatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds tempting, and my husband almost convinced me to choose this option. Still, I'd appreciate some feedback and advice from people who went to Thailand on their own. Is there anything we should know about while planning the trip? Any things to watch out for? Any dos and don'ts while dealing with locals? 

 

Also, since I don't want to get in any kind of trouble while being there or offend someone unwillingly, I'd be grateful for any guidance about the country's laws or cultural taboos.

TravelHacks,"We are planning on flying out of Sacramento/San Francisco/Oakland (not sure yet) to Nashville in the next few months. I've read many articles on flying with kids, but I'd like real feedback and advice on what it's really like. Particularly, I'm concerned about bringing the car seats (3 of them, each weighing roughly 40lbs), packing enough of everything, and how to carry all said things into the airport. 

It also looks like there are very few flights without a layover, except at horrible hours. If it was just myself, it wouldn't be a big deal waking up at 2AM to be on a 5AM flight, but a 1, 3 and 5 year old wouldn't be too happy about it. 

We've heard horror stories from friends taking flights with short layovers where by the time they get on the next flight, it's full except for their seats, and no one will give up their seat for them to sit with their young kids until they make a fuss about it. I get that if you have window seat, it's hard to give up. But an exhausted family will not leave their 2 year old who's never flown before in a seat with strangers far away from them. And those said strangers would not appreciate the uncontrollable screaming too... I digress.

Should we bite the bullet and wake everyone up in the middle of the night for a straight shot flight? What should we do if we do a layover? Long layover worth it? We have a crawler, so I'm cringing at letting him go all over, but I know he wouldn't be too happy being strapped in a stroller for several hours without being allowed down. Advice? Thoughts?

My partner has never been to Mexico, and we’ve never travelled together just the two of us. So I want to plan a trip for our 5th anniversary, February 2024!

We both scuba dive, so we’re also hoping to be relatively close to a beach. I read about Lagunas de Chacahua and found some hotels there, but I am not sure what the surrounding area is like in regards to food and night life. We’re able to drive, would you recommend renting a car?

Any hotel recommendations, incredible food, eco tours? I’m hoping to make this to be the most memorable vacation ever!","Planning a trip to Oaxaca, but would love to mainly be outside of the city center. Any great hotels that embrace the local ecology?",,EnvironmentalCry1962,,0,2/21/2023 14:49

I'm on a moderately tight budget, that's part of the reason why I'm choosing Laos, a relatively safe and cheap country. On the internet I read about Luang Prabang, the Capital, and 4,000 beautiful islands which seemed quite fun. But still a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I stay in a youth hostel or a hotel? I have bipolar disorder 2 so I want a more undisturbed condition (I have to take my meds, sleep early etc) but the socializing opportunities in hostels are also attractive. My English (C1\~C2) and Chinese (native) are good, can also speak Japanese and some German, and wanna learn some Laotian so international communication shouldn't be a problem. Should I stay in a hostel or a budget hotel? Or a hostel with single rooms?
2. I would also like to take the Laos-China Railway. But it seems that online booking is not available for the Laotian section. Any hacks on how to make my railway experience easier?
3. I'm quite left-wing so I don't have much interest in the religious culture there but not offending others is still important. I heard that you should never give or recieve things with your left hand and never touch the head of another person. Any other taboos in Laos that foreigners might often break?
4. What non-religious travel attractions are there besides maybe Vang Vieng and the 4,000 islands? I would like more adventures and interaction with locals and other tourists. 
5. Any advice on how to do more outdoor activities in the Wet Season? Can I still take rafts or camp or do whatever outdoor activity in June or July?
6. About tropical diseases and crimes. Is Laos generally safe for a solo traveller who would like to explore the night life of the vibrant capital, or go to more adventurous places?
7. Finally, any other tips on how to safe money while having fun? My total budget (including getting into the country) is maybe only $1,500 or 10,000 yuan so saving some unnecessary expenses is also a good idea.",Traveling to Laos in June or early July,,TheShoA17,,0,2/20/2023 5:43

TravelHacks,"In the past I've used [booking.com](https://booking.com) to find places to stay on vacation and I've learned to make sure to check the ""excluded"" section to get a real idea of how much it's going to actually cost. Typically that section included taxes and in the past 10+ years you started seeing ""resort fees"" included there as well. For the most part it wasn't a problem because, typically, every place had similar fees and it didn't change the price THAT much.

However, I am now finding a lot of places (it appears to be mostly vacation rentals) that list their accommodations at significantly lower prices and then make it up with various different fees. For example, I recently found the following in the ""excluded"" section: ""11 % Tax, 9.99 % Destination fee, US$ 18.65 Tourism fee per night, 19.98 % Property service charge, US$ 205.13 Cleaning fee per stay"". It made a listing which originally came up as $222 come to a total of $592.68... which, btw, you can only find out if you start the booking process and get to the details page where it, somewhat ironically, calls it that price the ""No Surprises! Final price.""

Frankly, I don't have a problem with it being a fairer price, but it makes the ""sort by price"" feature completely useless since ""sort by price"" doesn't use the final price. So, does anyone know of a way to get ""sort by price"" to sort by the actual final price? Maybe by filtering out ""homes and apartments""?

There’s no doubt the last few years have been tough. First the pandemic and now perpetual talk of a narrowly avoided recession – it’s enough to make anyone need a break.

Scouring travel websites can also result in a sinking feeling. Flights have gone up (2022 saw the biggest ticket price hike for more than 30 years according to some reports) and car hire has too.

When Which? analysed costs in nine holiday hotspots over the Easter holidays, it found increases of 72 per cent on average. Meanwhile, the company has also reported package prices soaring by 20 per cent or more.

I've booked car rental online and got an email saying, that I have to pay upfront and send them credit/debit card number or do a wire.

TravelHacks,"Honestly, I could complain about this for days. From so many different angles. But for me right now the problem I’m most irritated at lately is the global travelers themselves.

People seem to be only interested, or at least an overwhelming majority of people, in going places they have already seen or heard about. Massively contributing to over-tourism and overcrowding, for what? Keeping up with Jonses? Never really thinking critically about where they should go or what it might impact? Does everyone actually love art history so much that we need to queue for the Mona Lisa? Or have people just heard about it. 

Call me incredibly salty, I probably am, but I’ve worked my ass off for 4 years with my wife on a high quality travel YouTube channel entirely dedicated to off path places. To digging deep and travelling past the trip advisor. Hiking along 1000 year old medieval pilgrim paths in Tuscany with more hidden gems than you can imagine, places that desperately could do with some tourism dollars, a mere 20 minute train ride from tourist clogged Florence. I go out into the woods to show a truly authentic German beer festival where the old traditions are alive and well instead of just covering Oktoberfest. I go to the sorts of difficult Alpine Christmas markets that many locals haven’t even heard about instead of just showcasing Munich and Nuremberg. I was the only person that week to visit several Ancient Greek cities in Turkey that are mind blowing. I have these places entirely to myself, places that would love and benefit from some tourism. If only we stopped concentrating it one or two places and instead spread it around. 

Do you know what kind of viewership the truly off path stuff gets? Zilch. Nothing. A crumb. I’m faxt it negatively impacts the growth of my channel for months. 

But yet if I do a video about a place people are already familiar with? Oh boy, tons of views.

The market pressure is on the influencer to be a sell out. 

It does my head in. If you want to travel deeper and not just be another tourist then you have to put in some work and at least expose yourself to new things, but from what I can tell by the travel audience at large….this is not what they do. I’ll hold your hand and take you to the hidden gems you say you want, all you have to do is click. 

I used to blame the influencers. Then I tried to become one to break the chain and do my part. Now I see how the people who got big, got big and it’s our fault.

It breaks my heart. Truly.

— if you want to see the proof for yourself you can find me on YouTube at NearFromHome. You’ll see the viewership for itself. Or, if my content is crap then you are welcome to give me a well deserved reality check.

TravelHacks,"I wanted to share my CC points strategy with the community. I've been fortunate to be able to fly across the world for free the last few years with this simple strategy (Europe, Asia, Africa). I've always found the biggest limitation/expense for global travel to be the cost of the flights. Once this major expense is paid for I find travelling abroad is more affordable than many locations in the United States. 

As many of you know, sign-up bonuses for travel cards can be very lucrative. I like to pair the Chase Sapphire (60k sign-up) with the United MileagePlus Card (50k sign-up bonus). The Chase Sapphire Reserved card has many benefits including the ability to transfer points to a variety of airlines (United, Southwest, KLM, ECT). 

Why Chase Sapphire?

The Chase Sapphire Reserved card has many benefits, hotel credits, discounts, travel insurance, ECT. It is known as one of the most comprehensive travel cards on the marked. My favorite perk is the ability to transfer points to a variety of top airlines including United, Southwest, ECT. This give me the opportunity to find the most affordable award flights and maximize my available points.

Why United Mileage Plus?

United is part of Star Alliance and has access to many of the top global airlines. They have an incredible amount of global routes, allow free bags and have a lot of award availability if you book in advance. Most importantly you can take advantage of the United Excursionist perk perk allowing you one free leg across the region you are travelling when booked with Award miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

Excursionist Perk Example: In June I'm travelling from Cleveland, OH to Lisbon (30k Points), from Lisbon to Athens Greece (free with the Excursionist perk) and then returning Athens-Cleveland (30k points). So for 60k points I have a free roundtrip to Europe with an extra leg. This would have cost me $1,600 at the time of my booking and it is only half of the point sign on bonus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Taking Advantage of sign-up bonuses: You can only receive the Chase Sapphire sign on bonus every 48 months. To maximize the sign on benefits I alternate the credit cards between me and my wife every two years. I sign up in 2023 for both cards and receive the (110k point bonus). In 2025 I refer my wife for both cards (25k point referral bonus) and she receives the 110k bonus points. Every two years we alternate and this has given us enough points for two free global roundtrips (Asia, Australia, Europe) per year. You can move any leftover points to your partner as long as you are living at the same address. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tips:

Book early for the most award availability

Be flexible with your itinerary to maximize value

Shop Award availability on multiple Airlines

Take advantage of the Excursionist perk on United

I don’t have much experience with booking hotels, but I read a short article explaining that rates often plummet the week/day of your desired travel dates depending on the hotel’s occupancy rate. I’m cautious to use this approach, because one of my desired hotels already doesn’t have a room available that weekend when I choose a Thursday check-in (plenty of availability Fri-Sun). However, I see some validity to this strategy because I’ve browsed rates for check-in today and they’re all much cheaper in comparison to March.

TravelHacks,"TL;DR

*AA flight from NYC to LA got delayed and then moved while I was on a layover in Chicago, they paid for my hotel and gave an $200 flight voucher without asking. On the return my layover was delayed by a few hours because they didn't have a pilot. I want to know if/how I can get a full refund on the entire trip because of how messed up it was.* 

I recently bought a round-trip flight from NY to LA with a layover in Chicago. On my layover my flight got delayed 3 times, before eventually getting moved to the next day. 

By the time I left the airport, it was 1 am and the flight they moved me to was at 5 am, so even though they paid for my hotel and a meal, I didn't get much sleep and by the time we landed in LA I missed the main meeting I was going there for.

On the way back I had a layover in Chicago, and it got delayed 2 times as well because they couldn't find a pilot, but we eventually left 3 hours late.

After the first delay/moved flight on the way there I got an automatic email from American Airlines saying they gave me 15,000 points (or about a $200) credit, but I honestly feel like that's not fair since I had to reschedule the meeting I was going there for and they also delayed my return flight. 

**Can I still get a full refund or a larger travel credit?** 

**If so, is there anything I should know before trying?**

I'm worried that since I got on the first flight they rebooked to 5 am, I'm not entitled to a refund. Also I'm not sure if my delays on the return flight justify a larger credit.",Can I still get a flight refund?,,mediumslushy,,0,2/15/2023 18:27

We're happy to travel around to our final destination by bus/train or car rental.  I don't mind a day of trials and tribulations with long flights and stopovers for a good price.

Is there a better way to do it?

Is there a website that shows the best airports to fly into and leave from in each country for price?

Should I go to a travel agent and ask them to figure it out?  I've found I'm usually quite good at finding the bargain but they might have access to deals I don't.

Hi All,

I've done a little bit of travel in my life, but never this extensive, and for work. Past work travel was in the US, and for a few nights in a major city, Boston, NYC, etc. I lived overseas for 3 years in the Middle East, and have been international a few times. I am looking for any travel trips for a 12-day trip from US East Coast to several islands in the Caribbean. I plan to go business casual but don't want to lug a huge suitcase. I'm thinking one carry-on size hard shell suitcase, and a backpack. Some lightweight khakis and 4 company long sleeve polos, and boat shoes, and a pair of flip flops, toiletries, etc. Any packing tips, for things to bring that I may not anticipate? I am not very sure about the shopping situation on these islands. Also, any cultural advice to not make an American fool out of myself? I will be taking small airplanes between islands, can I even take a suitcase on those? I don't really take any medicine, but I will take essentials with me, will that be an issue for customs? I will be traveling with my boss the whole time. We get along well, but any tips for that relationship? Do's/Do Nots? Also, this is my first time away from my wife and daughter for this long. I think Im just rambling at this point. Ill take any advice anyone is willing to give.

I would share the experience even just for fun I've recently thought of being an airbnb host and in addition to that be like a guide to pack someone's itinerary with activities etc and transportation included. Taxi fares are expensive and alot of these tourist spots just gouge tourists. I'm a hiker , outdoors kind of person and I love meeting people. I think having an airbnb setup and also the exclusive vybz of going out with new friends to places off the beaten path.

Thing is I can fit my camera gear in said Osprey daylite and it’d relieve me of some space and 3kg of weight in my carry-on if I can offset that to a personal item carry.

TravelHacks,"Your friends will be enemies by the time you leave this place if you don't do these things. This comes from someone who lived in Miami and always visits. 

1. You and your group need to have a similar budget. DO NOT come here with one person having a $700 budget and another person having a $5000 budget. It is not going to work - I promise. The person with the $700 budget is going to want to do cheaper activities - exa: only go jet skiing, while the person with $5000 is gonna want to eat at the finest restaurants, go on a yacht, parasailing, etc. Miss/Mr. $700 is gonna be salty and your trip is going to be ruined
2. Splitting checks is NOT a thing. If there is going to be let's say 6 people - they will give you one check. You all have to be ready to have ONE person pay that check and everybody else needs to pay them back. The best way to go about this is to assign each person a day to pay. One person gets Monday, one person gets Tuesday, etc. 
3. Come in even numbers. Problems ALWAYS arise when there is a trio or an uneven amount of people. An Uber X fits 4 people, so stop trying to squeeze that extra one person in. An UberXL can only fit 6 people. Everything in Miami is in partners (2 people). Don't have one person left out. A lot of time, that left out person will have to pay extra (like on jet skis and other activites). It just isn't a good vibe. 
4. Know your alcohol tolerance and your friends' alcohol tolerance. Some of y'all like to drink A LOT and start issues. Last year, I watched a girl get in a fight with the wrong group of people, and let's just say the entire south beach was shut down. If you know that you're the type person who gets rowdy and obnoxious when drunk, do not drink too much. It ruins the trip for everybody else. 
5. Ladies, you need heels to get in basically everywhere - esp clubs. If you know that your feet are going to hurt easily, have an extra pair of shoes in your bag or get some numbing spray so you can last all night. Nobody wants to hear that your feet are hurting and you wanna go home. 
6. Men will be charged for EVERYTHING. It is impossible to be a bum here. Find a promoter. It can save you hundreds of dollars. If you're a guy, find a promoter and go half and half in their section. Promoters will pay for literally everything if you're a girl - the yachts, drinks, etc. 
7. Don't swim at restaurants! It is common for them to have pools inside. That water is not clean at all. 
8. Lots of FREE activities. People gatekeep the free activities, but there are Museums, waterfalls, etc. 
9. Be prepared to run into celebrities. It is so common. Quavo has walked past me while I was on south beach. I've seen Roddy Rich as well. They are there to have a good time just like you are. 
10. Last one, but look up the music they're playing at the clubs you plan on going to. I have spent $90 to go somewhere and I hated the music the entirety of the night.","You're coming to Miami for spring break? LISTEN UP!

TravelHacks," Reposting my content because it got deleted in the other subreddit. I double checked their rules and there wasnt any that I have broken at all. I am reposting because when I had an issue with [booking.com](https://booking.com), there's none at all how they work (rebooking if cancelled etc). So I am hoping this post may help a few solo / group / family travellers in the future. Now going back:

[Booking.com](https://booking.com/) is great for solo and short stays. But sucks when you experience last minute cancellation. The only thing they could offer is

1. There only option is a Complete refund that would take 'business days' before you receive it back from your bank. They don't have any booking credits/coupon that you can receive asap so you can still immediately use the money that you pay for towards rebooking another place.
2. a maximum of 25 Euro price difference should the next listing you book with them is higher. And this 25 euro is something you can only claim and be refunded after your stay.
3. Their chat support isn't really a chat platform. You type something, and you won't be able to type anymore until the support responds. You also cannot ask for a callback through there

So unless you have enough money on your bank, lives in the US, UK / have enough money for a long distance call, just don't use [booking.com](https://booking.com/) for holiday stay with your family.

As for Airbnb? Yeah sometimes they suck, the only reason you don't get a response immediately is because a case manager works on urgent tickets simultaneously, but what is the difference if you get last minute cancelled by your host?

1. You choose to refund the money you paid for or get a booking credits/coupon instead. An option you want to choose so your refund goes towards the next rebooking instantly
2. Airbnb is better for rebooking. They will cover all extra cost. Even up to 100% of the previous cancelled reservation if there are limited listings available in the area. You don't have to have money in your bank, they will issue a coupon on their system and use that to cover the difference.
3. You can have someone call you from their chat

From my experience, the only reason why people hate Airbnb is because these people are entitled, don't know how airbnb works, don't know their TOS, don't have proof of their claims or simply the support theyre dealing with is an idiot which is a minority. But hey, what company doesn't have idiotic customer supports nowadays?",Booking.com Sucks on last minute cancellation.

1. Any specific travel insurance that is better rated - for service and claims?
2. Anything different for domestic Vs International travel?
3. I do have standard travel protection from my travel credit card (Capital One Venture X), so I am guessing some overlap of benefits there.

TravelHacks,"I am will be doing a lot of flying soon, &amp; will be needing to get good quality sleep on my return trips as I will have to go to work straight off the plane; therefore I have been researching different types of travel pillows. It seems that there are two types in general. The first is the standard neck pillow with which we are all familiar. You sit normally and it prevents your head from tilting too far to the side. The second goes on your table tray and allows you to sleep “face down”. An example of the first would be the “keepmove foam travel pillow” (I have not tried it so I am not making any reviews on it), &amp; an example of the second would be the “Betus Dreamer Comfort Inflatable Travel Pillow” (I have also not used it so am not reviewing it”.

Looking online has yielded practically nothing, so I’m wondering if anyone has come across any hotels/overnight accommodations within Texas and/or Colorado that were very accommodating for individuals that have limited mobility? 

If there are any, I’d like to look more into them and check them out before sharing. My grandmother used to travel a bunch (mainly Colorado) so having to stay at home is grating on her and we all hate how frustrated she is. Trying to find ways we can get her out again. 

If this is not the right sub please let me know any others I could ask!

TravelHacks,"I rented a car at CDG airport in Paris (Terminal 1).  I had pre-booked a reservation through Expedia.  On the reservation I declined additional insurance.  When picking up the car I was again asked if I wanted insurance.  I declined stating that my Amex Platinum card provides coverage and I don't need additional insurance.  Agent says okay and has my sign the contract which is all in French (I don't speak French)  As I'm signing I notice that the amount that he authorized my credit card for is 565e...my reservation was for $411.  I ask why the charge is different and the agent tells my that they authorize the card for greater than the reservation amount to cover incidentals.  He says that when I return the car, the amount will be adjusted to the reservation amount as long as the tank is full and there is no damage to the car.

I return the car last Sunday and notice that I've been charged the full 565e.  I question the charge and they tell me that the difference is for the additional insurance coverage I selected.  I told them that I declined the coverage.  They apologize and say that their manager is gone and won't be back until Monday so they can't adjust the charge.  They email the manager and tell me to call customer service to get this situated.  I say okay and go on my way.  Well today I call customer service and they tell me that because I signed the contract there isn't much they can do about it.  They declined to reverse the additional charge.

Rental agents are commissioned on upsells.  The agent lied to me and had me sign a contract in a language that I don't understand.  Now Avis is refusing to do the right thing because the contract was signed by me.  I've initiated a charge back with Amex, so who knows if I will get the money back or not.

TravelHacks,"It all started on a trip to Prague when I was having a tough time and feeling stuck in my life. I was searching for a guide to help me explore the city, but I had trouble finding one that suited my needs. So I decided to just walk around and take in the sights on my own.

As I walked, I had a vision of a cool and free traveling app that could help me discover new places and learn about the city's attractions. I was at a crossroads in my life and this idea gave me a new sense of purpose and direction.

When I returned home, I set to work on creating the app. I had no personnel, no investments, and no backing - it was just me and my passion for exploring. I put in long hours and poured my heart and soul into the project.

The result is easy to use and provides some information about the user's surroundings. It's too raw, I know, but I am proud of what I have created, and I hope that it can help others discover new sights and attractions in their own city.

from what i can see on the site i’m using, it’s approximately $1,900 to rent the vehicle for a month from the airport location, and $1,300 at the off airport hertz location. 

i think the off site location would be about 15 minutes away by Uber and cost around $30USD.

C3 is the option to see 3 museums, $88 per ticket! the City Pass is 5 museums for only $114 per ticket! amazing options are included, and they even include exhibits and other add-ons that would normally require an up charge!

From my personal experience, whenever I travel and visit a new place, I google the top things to do, the top restaurants to visit, local dishes, places to go out at night, some common phrases to learn in the local language and so on. It is very time-consuming when checking different websites and often the websites are plastered with a wall of advertisements.

Out of the need to simplify this, Travelmoji -travelmoji.xyz was born.

It uses OpenAI and ChatGPT to provide you with a timestamped itinerary and other additional info in less than a minute (compared to hour-long google searching). Travelmoji makes it easy to plan your stay and get the most out of it, all at your fingertips and powered by AI.

Would be great if you have 5-10 min to look into it and also provide me with some tips on how to make this product a success.

I wanted to get some specific feedback from you if you

1) Would you consider using Travelmoji

2) What do you like about Travelmoji

3) What needs improvement

4) What other things would you like to have included and would make it easier for you when you plan your travel

I thought I had a decent plan for losing weight while on the road for work, but now I'm not sure about it. My goal was to get up and have hotel breakfast such as eggs, fruit, yogurt, and perhaps turkey sausage. Then for lunch, if clients wanted to provide lunch, I'd have that so as not to offend, and if lunch were not provided, I would have a protein bar/shake or similar. Then for dinner, I'd either skip if I was still full from lunch, or maybe have chicken &amp; vegetables or similar.

This past week, I did pretty well for breakfast. Lunch was mostly fattening stuff (which was really tasty, lol), but I tried to not over-indulge. Then my new co-worker who I travel with this week and next wanted to go out to eat every evening at Olive Garden, etc. I ended up feeling like I spent the entire week eating. I'm afraid to weigh myself now in case I gained. 

Also, I went to the hotel gym, but found the equipment to be dirty and grimy, and several pieces in disrepair. I've purchased some resistance bands to use in room, so hopefully this will help.

It doesn’t have to be fancy, just somewhere we can rent a decent house for a few people and a long weekend without spending more than $1000-$1300 on lodging. Ocean beaches are a destination I’ve typically avoided, so I’m not sure where to start!

TravelHacks,"Hi All - I'm headed to a resort in Mexico next week, flying into ZIH (Zihuatenejo/Ixtapa) airport. I'm a female solo travel (pretty comfortable with solo int'l travel but try to be smart about safety). Airport transport available through the hotel seems outrageously expensive as I wouldn't be sharing with anyone. It appears there companies that offer more affordable pre-reserved private taxis or seats on a multi-person shuttle from the airport to the resort zone I'm going to in Playa Quieta. Just a little nervous booking them (giving them my credit card #) upfront without personal reviews. My concerns are legitimacy and reliability. Apparently there are also in-airport (versus the private taxis guys pitching at you as soon as you walk outside) transport companies that can be booked on the spot.

Everyone says you should get out of Reykjavik asap and explore Ring Road. But how do you determine where to stay while driving? Should you plan your days based on driving a certain number of kilometers or visiting x amount of landmarks and find beds within those zones? 

Do you have to book hotels in advance or can you easily find a safe place to stay after driving and realizing you want to call it a day?

TravelHacks,"I'm planning my trip to Japan on Feb 12 - Mar 3 and was looking for places to crash on the booking.com. Since I’m the type of person who wants to save coin everywhere I can, I searched for properties while using a VPN and compared prices to ones I got from my residential IP. I’m based in the EU.

I’d say 4 out of 5 times properties came out costing less in **¥** when I searched connected to a Japanese VPN server. For a 4 night stay, on average, you can expect to save around 60EUR (8500JPY). Here’s a few examples:

* With VPN [https://imgur.com/a/sqOzbWx](https://imgur.com/a/sqOzbWx)
* No VPN [https://imgur.com/a/2V6FJnp](https://imgur.com/a/2V6FJnp)

So how to save money on booking.com?

1. Use a good VPN, not a free one. I was using NordVPN;
2. Connect to Japanese VPN server and login to your Booking.com account;
3. Start searching accommodation for your trip;
4. Compare the price with the one you get from your local IP address and pick the best deal.

Be aware of the properties which receive NTS subsidies (they’re marked with green National Travel Support disclaimer next to each such property). The price in JPY will be much less but if you’re not a Japanese resident you’ll need to pay the difference upon arrival.

So before booking a place, do your research, browse booking.com with a VPN on, and (fingers-crossed) find a better deal for your trip.",How to save coin on booking.com with a VPN?,,initialrotation,,0,2/2/2023 11:17

TravelHacks,"Hi there, has anyone solved the problem of how to set up WeChat 微信 app to be able to make cashless payments via scanning merchants' QR codes, while travelling in mainland China as a tourist? I'm using the international version of WeChat 微信. I understand some turnarounds include: asking a PRC based friend to transfer some money to your WeChat 微信 wallet (in exchange for RMB cash to that friend) and you can start using it for payments from the wallet.

I planned on going to Japan for a month this summer and the airline only allows one (1) checked bag and since I don’t own luggage currently I’ve been looking into getting something new. 

The current issue is the suitcase I found that I liked is over the 62” linear limit. It’s roughly 63.5” linear inches. So I’m wondering if that extra inch is going to cost me (can they tell if it’s an inch over on sight? I never saw an agent break out the tape measure when I was going through airports that one trip…) Or should I just keep looking for one that’s actually under the 62” limit to be safe? I heard it’s more the weight they worry about instead of an inch or so because I’m not out looking for a 70+ inch bag, but I’m not 100% on that.

TravelHacks,"Hi all, I'll be in Oahu for 8 full days in March (not counting arrival and departure dates). Looking for some guidance on renting a car.

Below are activities or places that interest me (not comprehensive and I'm open to suggestions or tips here as well!):

- Snorkeling (do any places give basic lessons?)
- North shore 
- Turtle bay
- Whale watching if that's an option this time of year
- Surf lesson(s)
- Shark dive
- Karaoke spots
- Hikes with a nice view (is Diamond Head a must, if so, what time?)
- Latin dancing
- Waterfalls
- Quieter/serene spots that are not disrespectful/intrusive to natives (I know, this may not exist in some people's eyes, especially in Oahu)
- Tantalus Road
- Sunset at Makaha (do you recommend or any other spots for sunrise/sunset?)
- Best quality seafood, including poke and sushi (especially if they have great menu items besides shrimp)

I'm staying in Waikiki and want to rent a car for at least part of my trip just for practicality's sake. That being said, while I'm pretty active, I don't need to fit a dozen activities into every single day. 

My main reasons for wanting a car is so on active days, I'm not tied to a single area after arriving by bus, if I hear about a cool nearby spot that isn't walking distance, and so I can go back to rest at my place between activities with ease. I'm okay with some slower days where I only do one or two non-food activities and get around with public transportation or on foot. 

For the sorts of things I'm interested in, could I build an itinerary where I don't need a car for the WHOLE trip while not missing a chance to explore the beautiful island?

I was in Perth yesterday, not the one in western Australia where I lived years ago but in the original one, where all the Perth in the world got their names, the reason for the day trip was random no real reasons except that looking at old pictures in Facebook triggered the idea to visit the town….ops, city, seems like they are quite emotional about the topic.


The river Tay with the gloomiest day ever since I’m in Scotland, a reflection of what I feel lately ?
Weather was nothing like the sister in OZ and instead of the Kangaroos a lot of sheep, obviously as soon I decided for this trip I started to see everywhere advertising about Perth, love synchronicities and the feeling to be on the right life path, booked the train ticket at 5 am, regretted later, I arrived at 7 am and was dark, cold, raining but got me the time to sightseeing as much I could of this pretty medieval village, I have to be honest it didn’t impress me much and I won’t go back but it’s worthed if you never been before, the countryside is beautiful but it get dull quickly, the best part are the castles in the middle of nowhere surrounded by green lands, I won’t forget the fact that those buildings were built exploiting the local population, they might look great now but it is important to remember how many people had to suffer for few to live inside those representation of greediness and power.


Probably the prettiest part of the town
Wandering around memories from the past started hunting me and funnily enough wasn’t from Perth in Australia but from a Korean girl met in New Zealand, it was hunting my thoughts and I felt she was trying to reach me, I felt it even more real when in front a Ballet studio the name of the business owner was the same as her, obviously the girl I was thinking about is a Ballet teacher too, able to build a wall within my mind I restarted my walk lighter, the other interesting encounter was when out of blue I begun to think to a project started years ago for a cafe’-pizzeria with my brother and a Thai friend that we decided to call ”3 brothers” walking through this street I felt compelled to look on my right and in front of me ”3 brothers pizzeria-restaurant, a sign from the universe that is going to happen ? Hope so, would be great to start a business in Thailand, the only Asian country that match my personality.


3 Brothers restaurant, one day might be the face of my brother, my Thai brother and me on that sign
The day passed by nicely even if bloody freezing, at the end of the day I found that the most beautiful part of the trip was the beautiful hill to the other side of the river and the magical and mystical monastery, I could feel the spirituality of the place that was peaceful and soothing.


I believe that human beings can’t live without religion, it give us a purpose, a reason to be here on Earth, not as a random act but with a specific reason


The only place where everyone is the same and the accommodation free
Perth is worth a visit but maybe not two

We paid for a vacation car rental via Expedia and when we got off our flight and to the airport rental counter they told us they didn’t have a car for us. We called Expedia and they said there’s nothing they can do as customer service line doesn’t open until Monday. We had to go to another rental company and paid the higher costs since it was a walk up rental.

So now we have to go get a refund from Expedia but they aren’t budging at all on taking responsibility for selling us the reservation with the rental company that they couldn’t deliver on. We’re out about $500 extra because of THEIR mistake. Is there anything that Expedia should be doing (Expedia Rewards points) or that we (from a legal standpoint) can do to recoup our extra $500?

1. Where do I buy plane tickets?
- I looked on Skyscanner/kayak/cheapoflyghts and price-something (cant rememer, searched in incognito), found a flight that was around 790€ pp for a round trip operated by British Airways. If I go to buy directly from their website the price is 1250€ pp which is a big difference. Do you recommend third party sellers or should I book directly on BA website?

2. Which hotel in Las Vegas do you recommend? Is the food or at least breakfast included in the cost of a hotel or do you pay extra? If it is extra where do you recommend we eat - the hotel restaurant or somewhere else?

3. We are mostly going there because my future MIL likes casinos, so we will definetly be visiting some. What are the things we must whatch out for in a casino that may be differtent to casinos in EU?

4. What are some other sites you recommend we see there? We will be there for 4-5 nights.

5. We probably need a visa to enter the US am I correct?

Being skeptical of that I called the hotel myself to verify sure enough it was confirmed details correct no issues. They even provided me with a confirmation code(hotel).

TravelHacks,"Hey everyone - graduated this past fall and I'm looking for an unforgettable travel experience before I start working full time! Hoping that this subreddit can help me find the most frugal way to travel.

For an idea of my current plans and preferences:

1. Flying from the US (AUS), typically fly with Delta but I don't have a strong airline preference aside from not wanting to fly on Spirit/Allegiant/Frontier.

2. For accommodation, I would prefer a private room. I'm fine with shared bathrooms. Typically stay in hotels/AirBnBs during past travels, but I'm trying to gradually warm up to hostels for budget reasons!

3. During my travels, most interested in food (love all types of food, from street food to Michelin star cuisine. This is where I'm most wiling to splurge) and sightseeing (both nature and man-made). I don't like driving, so walkable places or places with strong public transportation/bus systems are a big plus!

4. No geographic restrictions. Quick note that I have been to quite a few of the main cities in the US in the last year (CHI/DC/BOS/NYC/DEN/DAL).

5. For current plans, I'm looking at a 1.5 - 2 week trip to all of Amsterdam/Copenhagen/Norway/Spain sometime in April. I expect this to cost $2500 - $3000 (I have a few credits that can lower the cost of the flight). IT IS NOT SET IN STONE. I could scrap the trip, modify it to include more/less locations, or do anything in between. Solely optimizing for the best travel experience (based on my previously mentioned preferences) for the budget I have.

Any advice, itinerary ideas, or helpful links/resources are all incredibly appreciated! If there's another sub I should post this in, please let me know!",Just graduated college - I have 6 months and $5000 set aside for traveling!,,Daneity,,0,1/27/2023 23:39

TravelHacks,"The Beatles, a well-known English rock band, visited Rishikesh in the 1960s, making it known as the “**Yoga Capital of the World**.” The well-known band spent time at *Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s Ashram* in search of **spirituality**.

When visiting this **spiritual city**, spending some time at this ashram is a given, but there are a lot of other places that demand your attention. Start the day off well with some **river rafting** at *Shivpuri*, a quick bite at one of the cafes along the water, and a stroll down Laxman Jhula’s eclectic collection of businesses.

Finally, relax at the ghat and lose yourself in the evening’s breathtakingly beautiful **Ganga Aarti**. And if you want a detailed roadmap to help you organize your entire trip, this is the guide for you. Keep reading to learn about the [top tourist destinations in Rishikesh:](https://nomadfreaks.com/best-places-to-visit-in-rishikesh-2/)

1. Laxman Jhula, the beginning of the trip to Rishikesh!

If you’re **planning a trip to Rishikesh**, don’t miss out on **Laxman Jhula**, a mythological bridge that is considered an integral part of the city. Tapovan and Jonk, two Garhwal villages, are linked by a suspension bridge 137 metres in length that crosses the Ganga River.

2. River rafting in Rishikesh

Among all the activities available in India, **rafting in Rishikesh** is without a doubt the most exciting and memorable experience you can have. Everything about this location is top-notch, from the naturally favourable conditions to the quality of the available human support. There are specialised **camping** and **rafting** packages available in **Rishikesh**, as well as a few well-known operators with excellent safety precautions. If you’re looking for a relaxing vacation, rafting companies will take care of all the details, including food and water. During the busiest times of the year, Rishikesh may get quite crowded, so keep that in mind when you make your travel plans.

3. Ganga Aarti, Rishikesh

When conducted on the ghats of Rishikesh at dusk, **Ganga Aarti** is the holiest and most auspicious of all rituals. Although the aarti is done at numerous ghats, Parmath Niketan Ghat and Triveni Ghat are the most famous. Smoke from the hawans rises into the air, lighting up the riverbank with beautiful floating diyas. Listening to the bells of a temple ring, hearing devotees chant sacred chants, and taking in the atmosphere is truly once in a lifetime.

4. Rishikesh’s Kunjapuri Devi Temple

The **Kunjapuri Devi Temple**, dedicated to Parvathi, the Hindu goddess, may be found at the peak of the **Kunjapuri hill**. In addition to the fact that it is one of Uttarakhand’s fifty-two Shaktipeeth, the shrine is well-known for its entrancing location, which provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the Shivalik range and the majestic peaks of Chaukhamba and Bandarpunch. This panorama is one of the reasons the shrine is so popular.

6. Temple of Neelkantha Mahadeva

The **Neelkanth Mahadev Temple** may be found in the midst of a verdant forest at an elevation of 1,670 metres and is located approximately 12 kilometres away from the city of **Rishikesh**. It is considered to be one of the holiest Shiva shrines in all of India and is highly recommended as a **destination for tourists in Rishikesh**. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva drank poison during Samudramanthan, a battle between the gods and the demons, at the site of the temple.",Best places to visit in Rishikesh,,nitinkumar_7178,,0,1/27/2023 12:18

TravelHacks,"In Europe, usually you have to pay to use a public toilet. I've found that despite that, they are usually not that clean and not always you can pay by card, which means you need to have coins ready. 

However, something I often do locally (I am German and live in Frankfurt), is to go to any university building and use their toilet. They are free, quiet and most of the time very clean. The only dirty toilets you'll find there are usually only in buildings, which are frequented by many students (buildings which contain many lecture halls for example).


University buildings can mean lecture halls, student canteens, faculties of whatever subject and libraries. 

That way, in Frankfurt alone, I know of at least 15 places, which are spread all over the city and where I can always find a clean and free toilet.

The most clean and quiet toilets are usually found in the university buildings, which deal with more niche subjects. For example, i've found that in Frankfurt, the buildings for medicine students usually have the most clean toilets followed by the physics building.

From my limited research, it looks as though you can double dip via Hyatt and American. Do any other airlines/hotels partner together to get miles/points when you book one or the other?

I like that with National Emerald Club you can just pick a car a go. Do any other car rental companies offer this? Is it better to get car rental points or link the reward to air miles?

However my upcoming trip is funded for the most part by points (with only 2 shorter flights being paid out of pocket). Since they’re points funded, my assumption is that the credit card protection no longer applies. ( as most policies require the trip to be paid with the credit card you’d claim on).   My question is whether my assumption is correct and I should spring for insurance or is my assumption wrong?  Since it’s a bit more of a pricey itinerary if I paid out of pocket I want to make sure I’m adequately protected.

TravelHacks,"Hi everyone!

I've been working on ""**One Second Diary**"" - a video diary app inspired by this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day).

The idea itself is pretty simple:

* Open the app at the moment of your day that you would like to remember in the future
* Tap the Record button and save a short video (or upload from gallery)
* That's it, open the app the next day and repeat the process

Then, after a couple months or even years:

* Tap the button to generate a compilation of all those videos, creating the movie of your life

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It's perfect for documenting the places you have been to, easily exporting a movie that contains the date, locale and subtitles for each recording.**

&amp;#x200B;

The app is packed with features:

* Add or edit subtitles in the videos
* Add automatic or manual geotagging on top of the videos
* Choose the date format and color to show on top of the videos
* Create profiles to save videos separately
* View all recorded days in a calendar
* Generate custom movies by periods or selected videos only
* Receive scheduled daily notifications
* Dark Mode
* Available in 8 languages

&amp;#x200B;

And of course, it's totally free, without ads.

&amp;#x200B;

TravelHacks,"If you're going on something organized or to a country where the medical care is readily available and good, you can disregard this tip. This is for people really going bush, going out to the open sea or the high arctic, going potentially days or weeks travel from anything resembling a medical clinic - people who may need emergency access to antibiotics and other medications that normally require a prescription. These are the trips on which you're taking a full suturing kit.

You need an expert travel medicine doctor and I guess you also need to be the sort of person whom a doctor would trust with medications normally only administered by professionals. Usually that's fellow scientists etc, but if you're planning a real 'expedition' travel adventure and need to be able to look after yourself, you need to have an appointment with a doctor with relevant experience in supporting remote travel and extraction, and go over what you need. You can go straight to a $$$ commercial business that supports this kind of stuff (eg [https://covacglobal.com/](https://covacglobal.com/)) or just look for a local travel medical clinic or private medical practice that supports expedition travel for vaccinations etc.

If you don't want to do it this way, you can still get hold of broad spectrum antibiotics and prescription strength topical sulfacetamide-type treatments without going through a doctor. Sadly, the whole 'resistance' argument is BS when the global agricultural industry is chugging down powerful antibiotics like there's no tomorrow. Just get online and buy your stuff from the same places that agricultural and fisheries businesses do. It's the same pills from the same factory, even if they lie about it and say it's not - for liability reasons. This for when you need something effective within 12-24 hours or it's going to mess up your whole trip and potentially kill you - e.g. broken bone(s) or large infected wound, serious bacterial ear or eye infection, really nasty parasite etc.

I am guessing this comment is going to get a bit of blowback from people objecting to 'breaking the rules' to get prescription strength medicines even if it's perfectly legal (it is) and perfectly safe IF you (and your expedition doctor, if you have one) know what you're doing (it is). If you are clueless about how these treatments work and when / how to use them, this advice is NOT for you. I'm just addressing the issue of supply here.

A note to US-based travelers. Be aware that you can get some things over the counter in Asia, Middle East, Europe and elsewhere that require a prescription in the USA. An example is or was the painkiller sometimes sold as voltaren, though I think just recently you can now get that without a prescription in the US - it used to be something you could buy OTC in Asia but not in the USA. Various de-wormers and other useful meds are easier to get in many countries. I use my travel to these countries as opportunities to pick up things from a pharmacy / apotheke that I can use later. Just remember that the medication will likely be sold under a different name elsewhere.",Taking it to 11: point 11 travel tip - what's in your medical kit,,UWarchaeologist,,0,1/25/2023 19:44

TravelHacks,"To add to the list:

1. Vacuum compression bags for clothes. Once you use them, you'll wonder how you travelled without them.
2. For long flights and long days where you maybe sleep on a train overnight and don't get to change clothes, and more especially underwear, bring some very light panty liners.  Swapping them out is like having a fresh pair of underwear.
3. Visiting high-impact tourism cities in high season (Venice, Rome, Florence, Istanbul)? Don't be the cool adventurer traveler who wouldn't be caught dead in an organized tour or cruise. Being part of a pre-arranged tour or cruise is what allows you to skip that 3-hour line into the Vatican or Topkapi palace and actually see the stuff you came to see.
4. You don't need that restaurant meal, at least not more than once a day. Buy a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese and some apples or whatever is the local snack.
5. Put the camera away. It's liberating to enjoy travel without feeling that it didn't happen without a selfie and a social media post.
6. Scan your passport, itinerary, contact information, drivers license, bank phone numbers etc and put it all on a google drive that is shared with family or a trusted contact back home. If you lose everything, it's incredibly useful to have.
7. For more adventurous travel, a quart bag medical kit should have cold and flu symptom relief pills, motion sickness treatment, bandage tape (anything can be a bandage, so you just need the tape), pain killers, zinc and vitamin C tabs, antihistamine, anti diarrheal medicine, UTI treatment if you're prone to UTI's, location specific meds eg for malaria, and a broad spectrum antibiotic that you educate yourself on the appropriate time and way to use).
8. Travelling alone is awesome. Bring a few small representative gifts or items from your own country to give to people who befriend and/or help you on your travels.
9. Love a cup of tea or coffee or just want to boil water? You can get small portable folding compact kettles to boil water from any electrical outlet and have that cuppa anytime.
10. If you are spending more than a few hours in any city, master the public transport system and use it to get around.",10 More best travel tips not on that list of 50,,UWarchaeologist,,0,1/25/2023 3:52

Long story short, my wife and I are expecting and hoping all goes to plan, we would like to travel with the baby a couple of months after the delivery. Has anyone booked a ticket for an unborn baby?

TravelHacks,"Hi, I am thinking about going to Hawaii for a week or so in March. First time there besides a brief layover. 

I don't travel much so I'm trying to make the most of this excursion in the way that I enjoy to travel. I prefer moving a more measured pace. I don't rush to get as many photo opps at popular sites as I can during my trips and I don't mind going back to my room for a nap after a good meal even though it's ""wasting the day."" 

But I'm also a single dude (31) who enjoys going out dancing and meeting people. I stay fairly active and would love to do a few surfing lessons, go snorkeling, and of course, hike and take in amazing sights. 

Given this description, what would be your recommendation? Both of my friends who live or have lived in Hawaii recommend Oahu if it's my first trip, while Reddit seems to skew more towards Maui or doing both. I'm sure I'll have a blast in any case, but all input is welcome!

TravelHacks,"I used to work as a travel agent and went and ""tested out"" hotels. 

In my opinion whenever you need a place to stay; go through AirBnB, TripAdvisor or booking.com and research yourself.

The reason being that everyone has a different taste, staff change and hotels upgrade/downgrade over time. Someone may have an amazing stay at a Novotel because they know Novotels are reliable while someone else may find them boring as they're ""always the same"". 

Example from when I worked as a travel agent: honeymooners told me to book them ANY hotel in Istanbul with a suite (no budget). Based on reviews and previous honeymooners I booked the kempinski. They hated it! They hated the style which so many other praised (I couldn't even blame them. I wouldn't have liked it myself either but again: everyone's different).

Also on those sites you can select what you want to spend and what area you want to stay in, which are big factors.

People tend to suggest hotels they stayed at based on their overall holiday experience rather than the ""quality"" of their hotel. Even if it was years ago and several things could have changed since.

I think the hotel is an important aspect of your travel and it needs to suit YOU. 

Rather than asking for specific hotels, ask for regions to stay in (in Paris for example). 

Just my thoughts as I've seen a few people asking on here and don't want them to be disappointed. 

Ps: I'm not saying that any suggestions were bad, just saying that people should still do their own research afterwards and not just rely on the suggestions given",Don't rely on others when it comes to hotel recommendations.,,menalii,,0,1/22/2023 12:51

TravelHacks,"Hey, the only flights I really have is the arrival on Milan on the 4th of March and I need to be in Amsterdam at least on the night of 14th of March for my flight back on the 15th. Also I'll only have my hand luggage on the plane and I'll be working in Spain for one month before this, so I'm trying not to go anywhere too cold as I'll only have one coat with me and I also thinking of budget as staying there so long is getting expensive! 

I'm looking for any tips and things to do, day trips and if Lugano, Como, Verona and Venice are really my best options of cities to visit. Hotels and restaurants or even things to eat that you'd say is traditional are also appreciated! 

Right now my idea is: 

4 - 9 Milan with one day trip to Lugano and maybe a soccer game at San Siro 

Get a train in the morning to Verona and spend around 5 hours there and a train to Venice after. 

9 - 13 Venice 

13 maybe go back to Milan to take the plane from there instead of Venice Airport as I'm seeing it's cheaper, but open to suggestions. 

13 - 15 Amsterdam, I know it's not a lot here, but I only really want to visit Rijksmuseum as most things I wanted to do I already did in 2019 when I visit for the first time.

TravelHacks,"This is long , I apologize. I have a fear of heights, and planes. I flew from Vegas to New York 8 times as a child/teen. My First flight I was like 4 so I don’t remember much. Just an overall uncomfortable feeling once we took off , I remember I didn’t like it but I was so young I probably fell asleep. My first “long” flight as an 8 year old I was freaking out so much the flight attendant was visibly very worried and asked my mom if I was ok. My mom said oh yeah and told me to calm down and stop embarrassing her. flight home they drugged me. As a teen it got worse , I tried being ms.coolio but as soon as we took off I started hyperventilating and crying again. Flashback to the last 2 flights I took as a 20 year old. 
Overwhelming feeling of doom. It was like no fear I had ever felt ever. One flight was from NOLA to LAX and the whole time I wished for death rather then continue flying. Hands and knees uncontrollably shaking, tightness in my chest, rapid breathing , tears the whole 6 hours. Typing it out has me tearing up and my throat closing. Last fight was from Vegas to salt lake , then from there to Hawaii. I got drunk and took about 4 Benadryl. I get to the plane and it’s absolutely tiny, all of the drowsiness is gone, full on panic sets in. The flight back to Vegas was the most fear inducing horrible time ever. I didn’t stop shaking for hours after. Every time I’ve flown it’s been with people who comfort me the whole time and are experienced flyers. On the last flight my aunt who’s literally flown everywhere in the world and also has a fear looked at me and said ,you really really don’t like this , I can tell, the terror is in your face 
I’ve done so much research to try and help my fear , I know it’s safer then a car , I know this . It dosnt stop my knees from shaking anytime I get near an airport or hear a plane. I’ve faced my fears so many times for years , it’s worse now. Frozen in Debilitating real fear as soon as I step on a plane. 
On the other hand I’ve never been scared of boats, I’ve been on cruise ships, tiny boats, boats in rough seas and on whale watching boats that are going full speed ahead toward a blue whale and I’m at the bow like rose having the time of my life. The ocean is a welcome place for me , especially being a California girl. 
How do I travel without making myself miserable?  I have such a desire to travel with such a real fear. Can I just take a cruise to Europe plan to be there for a month and take a cruise back? Anybody else who has faced their fear and decided ,,, yeah …no. 
I did it , so many times , hoping I’d get over it and I decided it’s not getting better it’s getting worse…. 
Also I’m located in the us , I want go to Scotland at least in my life time 18 hour plane ride , I would have to be knocked out.

What exactly scares me?: 
heights, 
the confined space of planes,
the fact I’m in the air and don’t belong there, the turbulence(I know it’s nothing to be scared of)
take off is the absolute worst . Literally I’d rather be dead then go through another takeoff.

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,

Does anyone know how I can set a generic price alert for entire regions on relevant platforms for overnight stays, i.e. [booking.com](https://booking.com), Airbnb etc., if I don't refer to a specific place?

The background is: E.g. I live in germany and I simply want to go to the foothills of the Alps, no matter if south of Munich, Füssen, Oberstdorf - the main thing is in / near the mountains. actually, only the accommodation price is important to me; I find exciting and sensible tours everywhere. Even during the week is an option, as I would then simply work from home.

And I'm sure that with a bit of spontaneity and advance planning, you can find absolute bargains, because there are certainly some hosts who want to fill their rooms at the last minute.

A meta search platform would probably be best, as I don't necessarily reach all the small niche portals with Booking / AirBnb.

Let's say I am booking a return flight back home on the 20th and 21st.

On the 20th: I fly from Seoul, layover in LA for 2 hours, then to New York. Travel time is 20 hours  
On the 21st: Fly from Seoul, layover in LA for 24 HOURS, to New York. Travel time is 44 freaken hours  
Both are arond the same price

The thing is for the 21st does have the option to pretty much have the same exact return schedule but that's an extra $600. It's literally the same exact airline/plane/ and flight number. 

Because of that, I was thinking if I do arrive in LA on the 21st, is it a thing to ask the gate agents if they can just simply add me in the flight home instead of the next day? Basically try to add myself in the return flight and not pay that $600. Of course if all the seats are filled, I'll understand and wait the next day. But seems so weird it wont give me the option to take the earlier flight when clearly there's still room in the plane.

TravelHacks,"Hi Everyone,

Basically wanted to ask this. I made the mistake of buying a flight from Toronto to Barcelona that has a fly over in Paris and I am worried about any flight cancelation / delay, baggage getting lost in the connecting flight. 

I thought I bought the ticket with my card with travel insurance and baggage insurance but I bought it with my cash back one that does not have any insurance for this…

Is there some kind of default compensation I can get from an airline or airport if my baggage is lost or if my flight is cancelled/delayed and I end up losing money from my pre booked airbnb and having to pay for other expenses?

Another question could be, can I ask the airline to re-charge me or MOVE the charge to another credit card that has insurance for this?

I guess the last scenario would be asking my bank to switch the charge to another card because of my stupid mistake since both credit cards are from the same bank. 

Both CC are Visa’s but I doubt Visa has anything to do with this so I wouldn’t bother contacting VISA.

So I've got 30kg of hold luggage allowance. I'm only bringing a bag which will fit in the cabin. If my bag ends up being a few kg more than the allowance of 7kg, I can see on their website that there will be an additional fee of $70 per kg (from the location I'm flying from).

I also read online that if the cabin bag is too heavy they will put a tag on it and put it in the hold. 

Now, as I haven't used any of the 30kg allowance for the hold luggage. Will I still be charged $70 per kg if it is over? Or will they just put my bag in the hold for free, as I've got 30kg allowance anyway?

Of course, i'll aim to keep it under 7kg but I am picking up a few bits of tech (laptop/camera) and I'm unsure of the weight right now.

TravelHacks,"Hey there!

I'm getting married this year! Wooooo! And my wife-to-be and I together have decided that we want to have a traditional honeymoon. Where we go somewhere, do nothing, eat and drink a lot, because frankly, we haven't taken a vacation together since we began dating 5 years ago, and neither of us have taking any vacation since we were in high school. 

However we are having a hard time finding trips that aren't going to break our bank, and I'll be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing. We want to go right after the wedding, in the end of July, but August would also be cool. So maybe another time of year might be cheaper?

We will also be flying out of Canada. From what I've heard, Canada is stupid expensive to fly out of...but really it's our only choice. Toronto, London or maaaybe Montreal? Once again...never done this.

And maybe we shy away from the all inclusive Caribbean resorts? It seems like the easy option, but perhaps there's cheaper options? 

I'm looking for any and all tips and hacks that you use to travel for a fair price. Because what I'm seeing is....the complete opposite",honeymoon without breaking the bank?,,WhiteyMacfatson,,0,1/18/2023 2:02

We’ve decided to only take a carry on since it’s a short trip and I’m stressing because I always bring crap “just in case”…lol 

Exactly WHAT would you all bring? 

Thursday - Fly out at 10:30pm 

Friday - Arrive in Orlando at 4:30am, sleep for a bit, I’ll be alone for Friday and probably just walk around the touristy area. 

Saturday- Sister gets in at 1:30am, we’ll sleep until about 7am, hit Disney as soon as they open and stay all day until park closing. 

Sunday - Flight is at 6pm so possibly drive an hour to the beach in the morning or do other local stuff until it’s time to go to the airport.

TravelHacks,"Hi guys,
 
I’m (19F) planning to travel abroad to learn Spanish this summer in July/August and was looking to get feedback or advice from anyone who’s done so before. I’m based in Ireland so thinking of the Canary Islands or mainland Spain rather than Central America. I’m looking to do intensive lessons as I don’t have any Spanish so like 20 lessons a week plus maybe 5 or 10 individual ones as that’s what these programs seem to offer. What is the best route to go with accommodation? Should I use the company or arrange private accommodation? I have two colleagues in work that are from Fuerteventura and Barcelona so could probably help me find legitimate accommodation there if anyone has experience with good language schools there. Otherwise, what are the red flags for a school? Green flags? I’m particularly interested in learning hospitality related vocab as that’s the industry I currently work in. I don’t drive so city living is better, does anyone who’s lived in the canaries know how feasible it is to cycle? I’ve only visited on holidays.

I posted on here awhile back about a trip to Japan &amp; after seeing everyone’s advice (which was all GREAT advice), I went to my partner and his buddy and discovered our plans had drastically changed. His buddy ended up needing to drop out from work stuff &amp; my partner and I saw that many people mentioned how cold it would be in Japan during that time. We didn’t want to get snowed in or not get the full experience, so we switched our destination to Thailand. 

That being said, we will be in Thailand for ten days. We are flying into Chiang Mai. Since everyone gave such awesome feedback about Japan, I figured I’d come here to game plan for Thailand (granted, our trip starts on the 8th of February-so my planning has been super bad). 

Our goals for the trip include: climbing spots (I love top rope climbing and would love to climb places over there… my partner doesn’t climb, so we would need to rent him equipment and would need a belayer for me since he doesn’t know how), temples to visit, places to hike, beaches to explore and relax on, and lots of food! It would also be cool to be able to see elephants. My partner also wants a bit of a culture shock for at least some of the trip. I’ve never been to Thailand, so I’m unsure of what to expect. 

Any and all advice would be wonderful! Our trip starts with us flying into Chiang Mai and ends with us needing to leave from Chiang Mai, but we are flexible with where we should stay in between. We haven’t booked any lodging yet, only flights.

TravelHacks,"Hi,

Last December, me and my wife decided to take a trip to Budapest, Vienna and Prague. We rented a car from Enterprise Hungary. Even though I had picked an hatchback car on online reservation, they upgraded it to a station wagon brand new car, which was 8 months old. It was a 10 day rent, and at the final day I got hit by a rock at autobahn and windshield got cracked. It was rather a minor crack (at least from my perspective it was), but the company decided to change the windshield altogether since the car was new. They told me that the new cars are treated this way for the upcoming auctions. Apart from the windshield, I have also paid for labor fee, taxes, windshield protector and so on that totaled up to around 1200 euros, which was way way over the price I had paid for the car.

I know that wifi coverage will be nonexistent in places, like West Virginia for example in the mountains, but I'm interested in riding from a stop in Northern Virginia out to Chicago for a work conference in a few months.

I work a fully remote job and don't have meetings or anything like that I have to take, so I was envisioning a leisurely, scenic train ride where I'd leave on a Wednesday and arrive Thursday night for the weekend. I don't need much connection, though if I'm going to be traveling during the week, I need at least a few hours a day where I can browse the internet (I'm a writer, so I just need access to email, articles online, and Google docs). I have end of day deadlines for having content written, but I have a co-writer who can fill in the gaps, so things aren't totally dependent on me if I hit a spot without internet for, say, two hours.

I don't love flying, and in a way this sounds less stressful and possibly even productive for me, but that rides on the assumption that I can meaningfully access wifi on the ride.

TravelHacks,"Just an FYI. I rented a car from Avis in Florida this past November and returned it on the 12th. The car was a bit on the rougher side for a rental but given how busy it was I didn’t care. I took pics and vids of all the minor scuffs and scrapes. Also notified an employee of a small chip in the windshield, he said it was fine.

Anyways today I get a letter from Avis that was basically two lines long saying I was going to be charged $514 for glass repair. I sent an email to the address in the letter simply asking for any and all documentation related to the claim and I would require it before my credit card is charged. I received a response stating that your photos aren’t taking of minor damage and that the vehicle was removed from service for repairs. I then sent an email stating that their response was fine but I would need some type of bill or receipt to indicate what the $514 was paying for because right now all I have is two lines out of the blue saying I owe $514. Avis then emails back and says that their sorry for thr inconvenience and that they’re are closing the claim without charging my card

My point is, not that it’s a new thought, but take detailed photos of your rental and keep them for a LONG time.

Also is anything above normal? I barely gave any pushback and they immediate dropped it, almost like they send these letters out and just hope nobody follows up on it.

TravelHacks," Hello, I hope you are all doing well

I have asked around and after feeling like I am at my last option, I am here asking for some advice and/or help. I am in need of finding affordable airline tickets as soon as possible so I can start my new job (will explain more).

Maybe this is the wrong subreddit to post in, but you guys have the best advice on traveling so I figured it couldn't hurt to ask here. If this is not the place to ask, mods please remove this posts.

TLDR at the bottom:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 22M, Korean-Chilean, recently finished college in the US, and went directly to Seoul as I haven't seen my family in 5 years so I wanted to spend some time with them before I go off to work. While in the US, I was searching for jobs and I got a job in Spain to work as a mechanical engineer which I signed the contract for. The only thing is that took a long time was getting the Visa to go work there but after weeks of talking to the company and the embassy I am nearly almost ready to get it.

**The problem is:** I had planned to go to Spain directly from Korea before I had arrived here, planning on getting the Visa here since the manager of the company who was helping me had told me I could do it from Korea, but it turns out he was wrong. I gave up my Korean citizenship a few years ago and I am not a permanent resident here so the Spanish embassy told me yesterday when I went for my interview that I would have to get my Visa in Chile.

I do not currently have the financial capability to purchase a ticket to Santiago from Seoul as they are around 1100USD atm and I had spent the majority of my saved up money on skin cancer treatment here (I am 100% okay now, but can show proof and treatment to mods if relevant). I cannot really rely on my family as my dad's business just went bankrupt and I've tried but I cannot legally work for any sort of cash here since I am not a citizen/permanent resident. I had already bought a ticket from Incheon to Madrid before arriving here leaving in 7 days, which I'll have to call the airline and hope they will change it and help me out.

Making it a little more tricky, due to me not being a Korean citizen, I only have 9 more days I can stay in the country before I have to go out. I tried to plan out everything before I came to Korea, but with my dad's business going broke, the passing of my grandmother, and me needing medical treatment everything went out of plan and I do not know what to do. I feel so helpless because once I get my Visa and arrive to Spain and start working, I will have money, but until then I feel so powerless.

**What I need:** just some advice. If you have ever been in a situation like this, what should I do? or rather what CAN I do? Do you know anyone that had a similar experience and if yes, what happened? I don't want to ask for money as that feels kind of scummy, especially since I don't know any of you, but is there any sort of organization that can help someone in my situation? I've tried looking at all the websites and YouTube tricks for cheaper flights but the cheapest I have found after hours of research is 1050USD for a one-way ticket. If there is any sites or codes or something that can help me, I would be so SO grateful.

TravelHacks,"When you book a flight or a hotel through a third party like Kayak, Priceline, or Booking.com, there will be many restrictions on your flight or hotel stay:

1. You do not receive loyalty points or miles that you can use to redeem additional flights or hotel nights. Using points to book flights/hotels can give you extremely good value (i.e. [you can stay a whole month at Hilton Bali with just 90k Hilton points](https://suitesmile.com/blog/2019/11/16/review-staying-in-hilton-garden-inn-bali-for-80-nights-with-only-240000-points/))

2. You do not receive status qualifying miles and nights to earn elite status on airlines or hotel chains (such as Marriott Platinum or Delta Gold. This can give you numerous benefits such as room and seat class upgrades.

3. If something goes wrong (i.e. airline or hotel loses your reservation), which happens OFTEN when booking though third parties, you need to negotiate with the third party to fix the issue, instead of directly with the hotel or airline. This is a pain in the ass, and something like this could badly screw up your entire trip. Hotels and airlines always give priority to reservations made directly with them, since they didn't have to pay a commission fee to the third parties.

When accounting for the points/miles not earned, the rates on these third party sites are RARELY CHEAPER than booking directly, especially if you already have status with the hotel or airline you’re booking with.

——————————————————

So what’s wrong with chrome extensions like TravelArrow? They promise to save the customer money by redirecting them to these third party sites. The creators/owners of these extensions are paid by Kayak, Skyscanner, Priceline, etc. whenever you use the extension to redirect to their sites, because it gets their websites more clicks, which means there will be more people booking with them. They are essentially a platform for advertising these third party sites TO YOU.

I singled out TravelArrow specifically because they create extremely cringe TikToks to promote their extension. In [this one](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRghg6nj/), they show that their extension found a flight on Skyscanner for $800 cheaper (lmao), but what they don’t mention is that the flight they found had an extra layover and was 7 hours longer.

TravelHacks,"Hi,

I'm currently in the process of trying to plan travel to SE Asia between the months of July and August, and was looking for an opportune layover to see an additional place. I was looking at flights from either DC or JFK to Singapore (where I plan to start my travel), and saw a good price for a flight to Singapore from JFK that connects through Tokyo, which is somewhere I'd love to spend a day or two in as I've never been just to experience the city, but the layover is only 6 hours. Overall, booking two separate tickets 3 days later would increase the total JFK - Singapore journey from $584 to roughly $850.  I'm pretty young and most of my travel has been around Europe from Europe, so no real use in trying to get an advantageous layover. But this is new to me, and I was wondering if anyone had advice on finding a layover that wouldn't be $275 more than the flights booked together.

But I also really love the thrill of traveling, so I am toying with the idea of starting a vacation savings fund, where I move over X amount of money per month to a bank account (thinking of using a free checking account from one of those online banks with no fees), and just letting it accumulate until I plan my next trip out.

I think this could be a really good practice for me to get into and actually get me to follow through on my travel plans instead of finding excuses when it comes time to actually plan itineraries (and book tickets and accommodation).

Three key points:

1. We are vegetarian, so adding a lot of vegan places.
2. My wife has mobility issues/crutches as she had hip surgery, so trying to find places that are accessible.
3. I want to do maximum activities, but due to my wife’s recent surgery, I am trying to have a chill looking around.

Essentially looking to see (a) if we can do things better moving things around (b) did we miss something big (c) my wife Vs my idea of a perfect day trip- where Reddit users will decide what we do with our day, see 30th Jan for more info

24 January, first day:

• Arrive at Haneda at 7.35 am

• Collect pocket WIFI and 72-hour metro ticket (I don’t think I need Suica as I can simply get a 72-hour ticket, surely that will be better, right?)

• Going to Hotel in Shinjuku where we will be based.

• A quick visit to Tokyo Metropolitan Government building sightseeing tower

• Lunch at CoCo Ichibanya

• Visiting Shinjuku Gyoen

• Visit Seikido (stationary shop) + Takashimaya Shinjuku

• Dinner in one of the places in Takashimaya Shinjuku

• Time to sleep

•

25 January:

• Morning visit Meiji Jingu temple (Harajuku)

• Visit Takeshita Street (any vegan crapes places?)

• Get to Shibuya

• Shibuya scramble crossing (because it needs to be done)

• Shibhuya Sky building (amazing views)

• Visit the kitkat store in Shibuya (google says it closed down but YouTube went there one month ago so not sure if it is open)

• Photo with Hachiko

• If you have any more ideas for the day, please let me know credit users.

26 January:

• Breakfast and train to Yokohama

• Visiting cup noodles in Yokohama (I love cup noodles)

• Visit Yamashita Park in Yokohama

• Visit Redbrick Warehouse

• Train back to Shinjuku

• Back at the hotel and rest.

• Redditt users, I think I can do 1 thing more on this day may be trip to Giza?

27 January:

• Disneyland Tokyo

• Hotel and rest

• Lunch at Afuri, Shinjuku

• Visit Ginza and see Muji store

• Eating dinner at Ginza

29 January:

• Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden traditional tea room

• Back to Ginza visiting Kimuraya Bakery (check egg less bread)

• Ginza Corridor street

• Ginza Kabukiza theatre view from outside only

• Watch a movie

(Redditt users, we both love watching the usual Hollywood movies in cinemas abroad; We can find one in Ginza or one where we will be living in Shinjuku. Any recommendation for a decent modern cinema for the movie?). In uk we have Odeon and vue in our city so we go for one where we can find reclining seats and is modern.

30 January:

MY PLAN: not approved by my wife

OSAKA (big debate between my wife and I, she thinks we cannot fit Osaka in this trip; she also says doing Osaka in 1 day is too much and spending 2 days means we don’t have enough time for Tokyo. Which side are you on, folks?

• Train from Tokyo to Osaka in AM

• Visiting Nintendo world which is my dream

• Visiting Dotombori and checking the Glico running man

• Train back to Tokyo/Shinjuku

My wife’s alternative plan (I am not on board with this)

• Spending time in Tokyo districts

• Visiting central Tokyo Imperial Palace Grounds

• Visit central Tokyo station

• Visit Shin-maruouchi (the shopping mall)

• Visit Ryogoku Station

• Try to watch a sumo wrestling match (Reddit users, do we need to buy this in advance?)

Redditt users: Both my wife and I will be waiting for your reply are you on my side or my wife’s side Osaka or Not? 6 hours is a lot, and I am mindful, but it is once in a lifetime trip.

31 January:

Visiting Roppongi and Akasaka

• Visit Harry Porter Café (Japan, 〒107-0052 Tokyo, Minato City, Akasaka, 5 Chome−3−1 BIZタワ 1F)

• Visiting Tokyo Tower

• Visit Toyokawa Inari shrine

• Dinner back at Shinjuku at Ryo No Myako Inshokug(Shinjuku amazing street food style place)

1 February (keeping it a relaxed day):

• Pack items ahead of the morning flight the next day

• Reddit users very open to suggestions for this day

• Go to Akihabara and visit the Yobachi Camera

• Visit the owl café (Akiba furou)

• Take the metro to any place/district that we loved the most in our trip.

2 February travel back:

TravelHacks,"I have been a road warrior in the past but took some time off from business traveling with the rest of the world and now my travel plans are again increasing.  

Here's the trouble, when the world changed, so did I.  I went from 60+ hours a week, traveling 50% of the time.  Pretty much surviving on take out, whether traveling or home.  Covid hits, I got a new job that's barely 40 hours and zero travel due to covid. We stopped eating out almost completely! My spouse and I have never been in better shape, nor have we ever felt better physically! 

A few months ago I had a 2 week trip to Prague.  For those not familiar with the local cuisine, it's similar to German, very heavy, fried, comfort food.  I LOVED it, for like the first 4 days.  Then I felt bloated and overall like poop. 

Here's the question.  What food tips do you recommend? I have some medical issues that make small meals preferable, also later in the day is better.  I also usually don't have a kitchen.  

I'm headed back to Prague soon for a couple weeks again.  Last time, I ended up wandering around a grocery store and grabbed random snacks such as nuts, croissants, fresh fruit.   But I haven't figured out proteins, this was extra difficult as everything was in czech.  I get nervous around meats, if I don't know what it is, not sure if it needs to be heated or if it's safe to eat cold etc.    Salads are hit or miss, had a random fish on one I want expecting lol 

So any go to easy hotel room meals that you turn to when you are done enjoying the local restaurants and you can't stomach what's on the menu for room service?

Can anyone recommend the best site or app to notify me of price fluctuations for a given itinerary?

I tried 2 from the App Store yesterday and the prices are vastly different, which makes me concerned that they are not “seeing” all the available flights.

There is also not enough granularity in the alert capabilities.  I would like to be alerted if the price drops but the travel date for one leg might need to be changed, etc.  One had the ability for +/- 1 day on the return flight but not the outbound flight, which was puzzling.

Also, are any of the paid travel deals sites worth it for a specific trip with fixed dates?  Or are they mostly beneficial for spontaneous trips when an unexpected deal arises?

TravelHacks,"Hey all, my friend wanted to go on a trip together (4 days) and there are time and budget constraints mainly on her part. We are both from the east coast. 

Our plan to keep things affordable is either a road trip somewhere from NYC or get a cheap flight to somewhere closer (max 3 hours?) to a place with good public transport or is walkable so we can avoid a car rental.

Im a little more well traveled than her and personally, I don’t have anywhere I want to travel to or see on the east coast (that I haven’t seen already) so I’m just looking for some suggestions and inspiration on how to shake things up a bit so I’m not bored and get something out of this trip too. Or looking to see if anyone has an itinerary to share or know of a place (an affordable resort getaway?) to stay that offers a bunch of fun things to do so I can get some ideas. 

(I’ve been to most of the major cities of Boston, DC, Philly, chicago, etc)

We like a combo between nature hiking activities and just exploring around town and taking in what that has to offer.

Pre-pandemic I would  take any ticket 450€ or less to any city on another continent (not Europe) that appealed to me. Osaka, Bangkok, Seoul, Delhi, Costa Rica were all places I went to for cheap. Sadly since the pandemic there are no cheap tickets to be had. Boo!

However, I can travel last minute and would be happy to drop everything and check out an amazing city in Asia or South America if the tickets were the right price. I don't care about dates, or destinations so much -- just that the airline is ""reasonable"" (no Air Koryo, please!) and that the tickets are a deal.

Does anyone know of any site where I can check last minute deals -- I would love to know about them. It is time to travel again, and there have \*got\* to be some deals out there. I've got flexibility -- how do I make best use of it?

TravelHacks,"Are travel clubs worth it?

We just sat through a presentation. It sounded too good to be true, so I suspect there must be a catch.

It was for exotic travelers club:
https://www.exotictravelers.com/

Basically you pay a one time up front cost ($10-20k), then you X amount of years of membership (5-25 years). They then give you many discounts/rebates when you do travel. The make it sound as if these discounts you receive will make it well worth the upfront price.

When i search google and Reddit i don’t see a whole lot posted. Maybe they have been all removed by the company??

What vaccinations/ jabs do we need currently thinking typhoid , Hep A and rabies -  

-recommended travel cards?- atm I’m thinking Starling 

- will we need visas ? we will be in Thailand less than 30 days straight however it may be more than 30 days accumulated as we may spend 25 days at the beginning and 10 days at the end in Thailand for example ? We will also be visiting Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia during the 10 weeks 

- drinking water - I’ve heard some people say they boil the tap water , some take tablets or filtration systems  - I was planning to just drink bottled water- what would you all recommend 

- in terms of travelling place to place we were thinking long busses and trains prominently maybe with flights from Laos to Vietnam as I heard travelling from capital of Laos to northern Vietnam is a long boring journey . - what would you all recommend 

Best way to do SIM cards ???

- any sure fire insurance companies ?

TravelHacks,"Many visitors to Lhasa need the essentials for their journey. It would help if you packed seasonally suitable apparel and equipment for your trip. Seasonal changes in the capital city's weather mean you'll need to pack differently depending on when you visit.

# Legal Receipts for Air Travel

You will be allowed to leave the country with your papers, so remember to bring them. So, you'll need to pack them first. And store them somewhere you can get to them quickly if you need to manufacture them quickly.

You will only be allowed to enter the territory if you have the proper documentation for [Tibet](https://peregrinetreks.com/nepal-tibet-and-bhutan-tour), including a passport and a **Chinese Entry visa**. The **Tibet Travel Permission** is the most critical permit for entering Tibet and will be secured by your travel agency before your trip to Lhasa. Please send us scans of your passport and visa when you book your trip with us, and we'll get your Tibet Travel Permit. After your Tibet travel permit has been issued, we will send it to your hotel in China so you can be ready for your journey.

# Clothes

Could you remember the time of year and your destination when packing for a trip to the plateau? Though it is a monsoon-affected area, Tibet does experience the full range of four distinct seasons, making it much simpler for many Western visitors to prepare appropriately for their trip.

Warm and comfortable gear is a must if you want to hike in and around Lhasa in the spring. It would help if you still packed warm trousers, not jeans, and a warm fleece jacket, sweater, or pullover. Even while certain areas may feel warmer than others, having gloves, a hat, and a scarf on hand is always a good idea. Also, don't forget your shades and a good hat — the sun in Tibet is intense.

There is less need to pack bulky sweaters and coats throughout the summer, but a fleece is recommended for the cooler evenings. Cotton shirts are the most practical and pleasant option during the warmer months. Further, pants with less bulk make it simpler to go about. Wearing protective eyewear and a hat outside is essential, as is packing a raincoat and maybe an umbrella for the summer rainfall.

Dressing for the weather in autumn is similar to dressing in spring, although warmer. You should dress in layers; the fleece will come in handy on the chillier evenings. Light clothes are OK, but heavier hiking pants should be packed for a journey to Lake Namtso.

Even during the day, you'll want to bundle up in a fleece or chunky sweater this winter. At night, you'll want a thick down or quilted jacket, and during the day, you'll want to make sure you have warm gloves and a cap. Protective eyewear, such as sunglasses, is essential due to the intense sunshine, and thermal underwear will come in handy.

Good, sturdy boots are a year-round must, whether or not you intend to go hiking. Since the terrain is often unforgiving, a good pair of hiking boots is essential. And please include a pair of comfy shoes for the automobile and the hotel rooms.

# Medicines

Non-Chinese inhabitants will need help with obtaining medications on the plateau. If you acquire a headache in Tibet, you may not be able to locate even the most basic pain relievers, so be sure to pack accordingly. Medications used to treat headaches, nausea, and vertigo may help reduce the effects of altitude sickness.

For any ongoing medical issues, pack enough of your regular medicine to last the duration of your trip. You should bring enough of your prescription medications to last your trip, plus one additional week just in case you need to see a hospital while in China.

# Preventative Medication and Skin Cream

Contrary to popular belief, the Tibetan plateau is neither icy nor unfriendly. The sun may be as intense on the plateau as in the tropics of Asia. Due to the thinner atmosphere, sunburns are possible even in the winter in Lhasa. Packing sunblock with the highest SPF possible is a must in Lhasa at any time of the year.

Also, the winds may be brisk and ferocious. Bringing skin moisturizers and lip balm to Lhasa is a brilliant idea to prevent your face, hands, and lips from becoming chapped while seeing the city. The sun's UVB rays are more damaging than the sun's UVA rays. Therefore it's crucial to have a good hat to protect your head from the sun and your face.

# Cards and Money

Despite China's flourishing cashless payment sector, most purchases on the plateau still require physical currency. Tibet has yet to see the full benefits of this trend. Most stores and vendors will only accept cash payments. And using native money.

The Rénmnb (RMB), commonly known as the yuan (CNY - ), is the official currency of Tibet. Any central banks in Lhasa, including the Bank of China, will allow you to exchange your dollars or other primary foreign currency for yuan. If you need to convert currency, you'll find that many five-star hotels provide currency exchange services, often at the same rate as local banks. If you want to return to the Bank of China in Lhasa to convert money, hold on to your receipts. – Find out how to make purchases and utilize currency in Tibet.

Although big hotels in Lhasa are more likely to take credit cards, you will only find a few places to use them elsewhere. Credit card acceptance is limited even for significant purchases, and the few stores that take them sometimes tack on a 4% extra. Only the Bank of China branch in Lhasa allows customers to withdraw cash against their credit cards, and they charge a fee of 3%.

These days, ATMs are conveniently placed around Lhasa. You may use any major credit card at any ATM in China, but your best bet is to use a Bank of China ATM since they accept VISA, MasterCard, AMEX, Maestro, Cirrus, and. However, before using an ATM, you should find out whether it accepts your card. The highest amount can be withdrawn from an ATM transaction is 2,400 yuan. However, there is no restriction on how much can be withdrawn in a single day. Your card's spending limit is determined solely by the terms you've agreed to with your financial institution.

# Helpful Technology We Use Every Day

Today's world relies heavily on electronic gadgets, so it's essential to always have a working charger on hand for anything from cell phones and portable power banks to cameras, computers, and netbooks. As an added precaution, it's a good idea to have extra batteries for your most frequently used electronics in case they die before you get back to the hotel.

A small daypack or purse is recommended so you won't have to lug about your big luggage while visiting places like monasteries or other tourist attractions. And remember to include a water bottle so you can stay hydrated on your travels.

# Conclusion

It's easy to prepare for the Lhasa trip by packing. Knowing what to pack is essential, particularly if you plan to visit Tibet outside the regular tourist season. The essential component of vacation preparation is ensuring you have everything you'll need, including appropriate clothing and enough valuable equipment. Please read this before you leave for the City of Sunshine, and you'll be prepared with all you need.",Tips on What to Bring on Your Trip to Lhasa,,ptreks,,0,1/3/2023 5:55

My husband has never travelled internationally. We’re looking to travel from the US to either Italy or New Zealand (or possibly Croatia) sometime this year. It feels overwhelming to even start the process. Which websites are best to look for and book international flights? How do I find itinerary guides that are full of the good stuff and not just hitting all the overly touristy places? Looking at train/bus travel in other countries also feels a little overwhelming. Are there travel agents that are actually great? There’s info everywhere which is awesome, it’s just hard to know how to filter it all. My job doesn’t allow downtime to do research and I’m currently working ~60 hours a week (while trying to also cook and exercise and sleep and stay healthy and sane) so maybe that’s why I feel like I don’t even know where to start.

TravelHacks,"Inspired by my own personal hell when dealing with Frontier these past couple years, I spent a good chunk of 2022 reading dozens of increasingly similar accounts of how Frontier's evolving anti-consumer practices have ruined/soured so many travelers' trips. This trend will likely only get worse in 2023, so I've decided to compile a list of the most absurd but common nonsense that myself and others have encountered with this budget airline, and some surprisingly easy options Americans have to avoid dealing with their lack of customer service, ridiculous fees, and no-refunds BS.

Flying Frontier can be okay, but as soon as something goes wrong (on their end)  prepare for a mess of infuriating gotchas, gross incompetence, and vacation-ruining time wasters. It's so bad that I cannot recommend Frontier to anyone but the most savvy, careful, or last-minute flyers. 

***Skip to rule #10 if you want a tl;dr for the most important piece of advice I have for when things do go wrong that I'm amazed is rarely mentioned on this sub.*** 

\------**PART 1: 10 RULES TO NOT GET F\*CKED FLYING FRONTIER----**\--

These rules/warnings are in mostly ascending priority since they tend to build on one another, but feel free to skip around:

1. **Triple check the carry-on/backpack dimensions** and then subtract 1"" on each edge. Do you need to apply the slightest force to compress the bag into the little metal cubes they have at the gates to check its size? Good luck, they have been increasingly slapping some travelers with the \~$100 oversized bag fee even though their backpack can easily compress into the cube, and can certainly fit under the seat. 
2. **Do not expect them to re-book you if your flight is cancelled.** Be aware of last minute flight prices, and never book a frontier flight when you know last minute flights can be 4-6x more than a regular airline, because in most cases Frontier will not eat the loss to rebook you. There are so many reports of them sticking people in shitty hotels for days to avoid a prompt but expensive rebook, and even stories of subsequent rebookings for an initially canceled flight! Dollar cost average that shit, it's often cheaper in the long run to pay a bit more for the non-budget airline where you're covered in the event of a cancellation, than have frontier pull a fast one on you and you're effectively out an extra $1k for a last-minute booking out of pocket, or worse--losing days of your planned trip upset and stuck in an airport/hotel.
3. **The 1-in-25 flight cancellation average is misleading, plan ahead.** Sure, you can rationalize that 1/25 flights are cancelled on average over the year, but the distribution of canceled flights is not a fair dice role. If you're flying during busy travel days, holidays, or notable weather events the odds that **your** particular flight is cancelled can be much higher than that 1/25 average. And you guessed it, these are the types of situations where last minute flights tend to be much more expensive than usual too! Not only are you more likely to have to book last minute due to a cancellation, you're forced to pay much more too--double whammy 
4. **Never expect to reach a live  support person unless you are physically at the terminal**. You cannot reach a real person over the phone (I've tried over six times for 2+ hours on hold and got through once), and chat is outsourced to southeast asia and they are unable to process refunds/reimbursements (as is regular phone support), and 8/10 times chat either went completely afk or ended chat abruptly. I haven't personally confirmed this, but I've read on this sub that some frontier staff charge a $25 fee to have them help you with rebookings/changes at the airport!? Ironically, the one time I got to reach real frontier staff at an airline I was told that even they cannot process refunds or reimbursements and to try calling in! As of writing, I believe Frontier is the only American budget airline company to claim they are going chat-only support, but we'll see..
5. **Travel voucher credit is often worthless**. This is not southwest, you are heavily restricted in how you may use your voucher credit. New credit now typically expires in 90 days, must be in your name, is only usable on initial bookings, and is almost always subject to their absurd $50-$100 cancellation fees. There's also a weird scam going around where some people have had [their flight credit mysteriously used up](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/frontier-airlines-frontier-miles-program/2094123-i-victim-flight-credit-fraud.html#post34657766) by someone 1-2 days before it expires that is its own rabbit hole I have spent hours trying to decipher. If you accept the voucher and are unable to use it in time, you can kiss a real cash refund goodbye in most cases. (SEE RULE # 10)  
Despite consumer protections guaranteeing you a right to a refund with most unexpected cancellations, Frontier offers vouchers as ""easy"", immediate alternatives to those not willing to go through the process of requesting a refund through Frontier--wait on hold for several hours and filling out a silly, in my case BROKEN pdf form for a refund request that must be manually submitted and can take weeks to finally clear. 
6. **Don't expect their online systems to work 24/7. Deadlines which incur fees are often effected by glitches/outages, and don't expect to be reimbursed when outages out of your control cost you $$ in additional fines** . For weeks forums and subs were plagued with complaints that voucher redemption systems were broken and travelers lost their credit after trying to use them dozens of times. Some spent HOURS trying to reach a live person, but support were unable to use it on their end, and unable reinstate the credits once they expired, basically telling their customers to eat shit and accept the loss because their systems had some bug. **This is absolutely unacceptable when you consider that vouchers are often pitched as a store-credit like alternative to those owed a refund**. One good example of system outages costing money is the cancellation/rebook functionality randomly failing for days at a time or certain flight numbers--forcing users to pay the \~$100 cancellation fee if they are unable to cancel the same business day they booked, making it more infuriating as you're wasting hours refreshing/retrying the site over and over + have multiple chats open + have two phones on hold desperately trying to reach a person before the clock counts down your $100 loss. Regular support staff cannot just reimburse you if ""the system"" is acting up and time passes, and if the system is down for you it tends to be down on their end too... Good luck
7. **Never expect a free cancellation/rescheduling even if you plan ahead, expect to pay $50-$100**. On paper, Frontier claims that cancellations are free within 24 hours and rebookings charge no extra fees if done 60+ days prior.  But, there are all sorts of reports of the fee being charged for cancellations made the next day, even if was within 24 hours of booking. Combine this with the notorious downtime/errors on their site, and it becomes comically difficult to cancel in time. I've booked a flight at the end of the day, had their site/service go down for the remainder of the night, canceled in the morning, and still been hit with a $100 fee. *If you book a flight that departs in less than 7 days, you will be hit with the $100 cancellation fee no matter what. Even if you try to cancel it immediately, it was officially considered too close to the real flight to be eligible for free cancellations the second you booked it* 
8. **Don't check a bag unless you don't mind it being lost** Yes this applies to all airlines, and yes there is insurance, but the combo of being unable to reach a live person at Frontier combined with their absurd stinginess in refunds/reimbursements makes losing your bag particularly bad. It's genuinely not worth the time to try to do anything if your bag doesn't make it. 
9. **Your carry-on is not always safe, you may be forced to check it anyway.** Often travelers are aware of the lost bag problem, so they pack their expensive/irreplaceable items in their carry-on to make sure it arrives at their destination with them.  Well, it's fairly often that bins fill up and the passengers in later boarding groups are forced to check their bags at the gate when they finally call them to board. These unexpected [forced carry-on checkings can and do go missing](https://www.businessinsider.com/british-airways-checked-in-bag-then-got-lost-2022-12) all the time, so be prepared to work something out or straightup refuse to board if you're carrying irreplaceable items in your carry-on and they tell you it needs to be checked. In some instances, the logistics of a last-minute bag checked at the gate make it more likely to be lost, especially if you have a connecting flight. Plan ahead and consider paying a tad more to board early and secure some overhead space, as it's never worth risking a last-minute forcibly checked bag if you've got something irreplaceable or very expensive you would never have checked in the first place. 

If you've somehow made it this far, stick around for Rule #10. It has served me so well that in my opinion, it can make flying Frontier worth it... sometimes

#         10. ALWAYS book with an Amex credit card, do NOT waste your time contacting support and jumping through hoops for a refund, NEVER ACCEPT A VOUCHER WHEN YOU ARE OWED A REFUND

Kind of a mouthful, I know, but following rule #10 will make frontier a breeze and even negates you having to worry about several of the previous rules. Simply put, whenever something goes wrong that should warrant a refund, you do not need to waste hours trying to reach a real person at Frontier only to be told they can't do refunds and offer you some 90-day nonsense voucher if you complain hard enough. Instead fill out a claim to contest the charge through amex's website/app. The process takes two minutes on your phone--uploading docs and lengthy explanations are typically **not** needed. While it may take a couple weeks for the refund to appear on your account, kick back and relax as Amex handles dealing with Frontier's absurd refund paperwork for you. You do not need a paid amex card either, every $0 fee amex card has this perk. 

**Why Amex?** Amex has a notoriously consumer-friendly process to contest charges, sides with their cardholders far more often than the competition, and has a streamlined process specifically tailored for their cardholders to request refunds for failed travel expenses(all major airline companies/rental companies included). Businesses and frequent flyers alike are aware that Amex works directly with airlines for these ""contested charges"" , to the point that some in the know will not even bother contacting southwest/united for refunds these days, and instead go straight to Amex to save time, headache, and most importantly demand a real refund instead of flight voucher credit. 

**Why not contact Frontier and take a voucher?** Frontier has so much fine print around voucher expiration and redemption rules that it is a laughable substitute for a refund. (See Rule #5). If a flight is canceled and they do not make reasonable accommodations for you, which has been the case over and over again on budget travel subs, there are federal protections in place that give you the right to a refund, and your cardholder certainly agrees. But, Frontier is free to offer you an alternative to a refund--the easy and convenient travel voucher! If you waste your hours dealing with Frontier and accept their offer of a travel voucher, and then later you realize you got screwed with an unusable voucher that has expired and you might go try to file a claim with Amex to finally get a proper refund. Unfortunately, it would be too late, as Frontier will actually bother responding with evidence that you came to an agreement with them to accept a flight voucher instead of a refund. **So** **Amex will side with Frontier instead of you and deny the request,** forfeiting both your right to any sort of refund and your time.  So do not play into their voucher offer, do not waste your time agitated while on hold when you should be relaxing, and do not fill out their absurd forms and request callbacks for days in an effort for a refund when Amex is an option. 

&amp;#x200B;

\------**PART 2: Should anyone still fly Frontier when there is any other option available?----**\--

So, if you're armed with an Amex and are not financially constrained by the timing of a  potential chargeback, when is it a good idea to fly Frontier? In my opinion it's perfectly reasonable to fly Frontier when **all** of the following are true for you and your party:

* There are no connecting flights
* You are not checking a bag you care about, or are only traveling with a small backpack
* You are already booking last-minute, or competing last-minute flights in the instance of a last-minute Frontier cancellation are not unreasonably expensive given the risk vs upfront savings
* It's not a busy travel day/holiday/hectic time of the year
* You will not be cancelling or rescheduling your booked flight for any reason
* **The Frontier flight is still considerably cheaper at the end of the day**",FRONTIER AIRLINES - My list of 10 rules to avoid getting screwed when flying with the worst American budget airline in 2023 [warning: long post],,BlastedBrent,,0,1/3/2023 1:08

But I want to go germany as early as possible as I miss her really badly.Before going I will have to quit my job my employer wont allow me take a month holiday.

I am travelling to europe not just for leisure.It is for a reason now.But considering the Indian situations it is expensive.

TravelHacks,"Hello everyone,

I am looking for cheap flights from HAM -&gt; HND for end march til beginning of april \[yes I know :( pricey season\]. I try to take a look at skyscanner, google flights, etc everyday to notice fluctuation in prices. 

Since yesterday, I noticed that there are sometimes really cheap flights (on skyscanner for example), which I can't even look at if I try to. Skyscanner tries to redirect me to Emirates website but the flight isn't available. \[Screen of the view on skyscanner: [https://imgur.com/a/XVuoymQ](https://imgur.com/a/XVuoymQ)\] The date on which I found this flight was 21.3-6.4.

My question is if this are ""real"" prices and if I am just to slow book them? 1.062€ sounds quiet cheap for me for a round trip with two different airlines (first Emirates then JAL) on the first flight (and only emirates tickets being on 1.500€ for normal relations).

I also tried to look for this combination on solo tickets (like on Emirates: HAM -&gt; DXB -&gt; SIN and then JAL SIN-&gt;HND) but it is way more expensive this way.

Either way those flights seem a bit odd to me (Like also why is it only redirecting me to Emirates if one half of the flight is with JAL? I don't think or know if you are able to book this way)

Long story short: Is it possible that those are real flight offers which just get taken really fast or is it just some miscalculation on skyscanners side?

hey everyone, Im not sure if this is the right sub, but Idk where else to ask. I hope I'm not breaking any rules, I apologize if I am.

I'm a medical student and I frequent home during holidays. Had a close family member pass away a few weeks ago and decided to take a leave of absence from medical school for a semester (after I booked the flights).

I'm supposed to go back to school tmrw, but I would REALLY REALLY REALLY prefer if i could reschedule my flight for the following week to look after the house and dog while my parents go back to asia to sort out some family matters this week.

So my question is: If I intentionally go late tomorrow and make it seem like i barely missed my flight due to traffic, would they reschedule my flight again without a penalty/cost?

I know they mention a penalty, but I've missed my *flight 3 times* in the past (including last week on the way here) and they always rescheduled it without additional charge. When I called to reschedule it this morning in response to the voucher email I got earlier, they offered to charge me ""only"" $80 dollars for an $85 flight next week.

If it matters, the airline is yellow (not gonna name the airline just incase), and At that price difference, I might as well just take my chances that the service agents show me some mercy like they've done in the past? It just sucks knowing that someone else might have been able to take my seat.

TravelHacks,"I’ve spent thousands of nights in hotels, mostly for business, occasionally on vacation, plus nefarious reasons according to my profile.

Anyway, right after you get your hotel card, go up to your room. There are several reasons for this.

• It’s no fun to have luggage with you and it’s pitch dark and you can’t find the light switch. Turn on the light empty handed.

• You give a chance for the room to adjust to your preferred temperature while you go back down to the car. I sleep at 55 degrees if I’m alone, 69 if I’m not.

• You get an opportunity to know where to park. Near the elevator or not, near the stairwell or not, near the pool or not, near the lobby or not, whatever is important to you. What’s the closest exit door to my room?

• You get an opportunity to make sure the key works before you do these other steps. About 25% of the time my first key card malfunctions.

• You get to check the room in case anything is seriously wrong. I’ve walked in on a drug deal. I’ve walked in on key 302 that opened room 203. I’ve walked in on sex. I’ve walked in on a blood stained mattress being aired out (suicide that morning). I’ve walked in on a married couple getting a divorce because the three of us had the same last name and she was sick of his cheating. I’ve walked into a Minnesota hotel room at 2am in January and the heater didn’t work.

• You get to see if the room is missing towels, television remote, shampoo, etc.

• If my wife and/or nine year old son might be miserable, I invite them upstairs for their opinions.",Key cards,,gobigred3562,,0,12/30/2022 22:03

TravelHacks,"Hello, fellows!

So I have an issue with Lufthansa. I want to get plane tickets from Germany to Colombia. We are from Bavaria, so flying for Nuremberg would be most comfortable, but the best option offered is through Frankfurt, obviously. 

So, if I look up Nuremberg-Cartagena, it includes two lay-overs, one of them being in Frankfurt. I find that crazy stupid, ofc I am not getting on a national flight in GERMANY. 

However, if I look up just Frankfurt-Cartagena, the total price of the flight SOARS by a lot, even though you are actually taking one less plane. From what I gather, Lufthansa is just trying to make you fill up these bullshit flights from Nuremberg to Frankfurt. 

Do you know if there is any way to go around it? My dad suggested that it is possible, that they gather location data to know, what kind of prices they can push. Can that be?

TravelHacks,"Starting to plan a spring/early summer 4 week trip to Europe for my sabbatical. My husband wants to spend time in his ancestral seat of Scotland, so majority of the trip 10-14 days will be spend touring Scotland by rented campervan (we wish to attend Highland Games and possibly a multi-day canoe trip). The time frame for the trip tentatively looks to be May-June 2024.

However, since I don't want to spend a whole month in one country and I have never been outside the U.S., let alone to Europe, I would like to see some of the places I have dreamt of visiting my entire life (we're in our early-mid 50s). I have several cities and locations on the list and planned on buying a Eurail global multi-day/month pass for flexibility. We're trying to narrow down which cities to visit and have capped it at three. High on my list of places I want to see in my lifetime are Amsterdam (Van Gogh museum; bike culture) and Paris (for too many reasons to list). Also on the list are Munich (Bavaria), Vienna (cafe culture/music/art), Budapest, Copenhagen (more bike culture), Florence or Venice (art/canals/architecture), Zermatt or Grindelwald (hiking in Alps; but might be better for a late summer trip). We are outdoorsy people and love the mountains and alpine lakes, but also enjoy coastal areas from time to time. I was thinking that late spring/early summer is better to be in southern Europe, but I don't know if I'll ever be able to afford to come back.

It's all a bit overwhelming trying to narrow down the cities and the easiest logistics. I've gathered that we'll book open jaws flights (KLM offers multiday stopovers in Amsterdam which could potentially save time and/or money) and travel between those airports by train. I'm generally okay with staying in the cities (unless we want to spend some time in the Alps) and I don't really want to drive outside of Scotland since we'll be driving a lot there.  Switzerland seems very easy to travel throughout without renting a car, but downside is cost. Given which cities we choose, and in which order, I don't mind train travel, especially if its overnight or a daytime scenic route.

TravelHacks,"I re3cently suffered a travel mishap which was not my fault at all. This was right before the big holiday air travel meltdown in which travelers are still trying to dig their way out of. 

Here are a few things I have learned from both experience and observation:

1. Buy travel- insurance Do not expect your accommodation to pick up the tab and fully refund you because of an airline issue. The hotel/airbnb host has nothing to do with the fact that your flight was cancelled. In this day and age of Covid and everything else, it makes zero sense to pay a little extra for insurance.
2. Know your rights- Understand what your rights are as a passenger, and when things go pear shaped, stand up for those rights! Don't need to be a Karen Supreme, but don't let them get away with shortchanging you. 
3. Be kind- During our air travel mishap which we were diverted to a tiny, closed airport with no amenities overnight, we were waiting for ground crew to set up the jet bridge so we could deplane. During this time, the pilot came out of the cockpit and answered passengers' questions. A couple of men in their 60s aggressively questioned the pilot. ""You said we had to land here because of freezing fog! Are you trying to tell me you couldn't see Rapid City from the plane? I was looking out the window and saw it just fine!"" he calmly answered that while yes, you could see the airport, had we descended through the freezing fog, the fog would create a layer of ice on the plane, and he would not be able to control the plane very well. These older men continued their line of aggressive questioning until they opened the aircraft door. They were trying to make the poor pilot look stupid, but the rest of us understood that he was trying to keep us safe. Being a dick does no one any good, and everyone harm.
4. Always keep a change of clothes, especially underwear, in your carry on! Luckily, we were only held less than 24 hours, but some people are spending 2 and 3 days in the airport. 
5. Keep any medications, at least 3 days worth, in your carry on with you! If you need to gate check you carry on, take out your meds, and keep them with you.
6. If you have dietary restrictions, keep some food with you. I made the mistake of not eating a meal in the airport when I had the chance. I figured I would be home in a few hours, and I could wait to eat. Little did I know, our flight would be first delayed a couple of hours, and then diverted to a closed airport with a single vending machine. Nope, there was nothing in the vending machine I could eat, and I didn't have any more snacks in my bag. While I wasn't in any health danger from missing a meal, I was certainly uncomfortable and hangry. 
7. Take the deal if it's offered. We were offered $520 plus hotel accommodation, plus transportation to and from the hotel, plus a meal voucher if we would have taken the next flight, which was the next day. We considered it, but were afraid the same thing would happen the next day. I wish we had taken the deal. Sleeping in a hotel bed is superior to getting an hour of sleep on the cold floor of the airport. 
8. Be patient. I know it's incredibly frustrating, but anyone who is working in the airport does not make the rules. Your fellow passengers are, like you, doing the best they can.",Learning from the mistakes and misfortunes of others,,vagimite2000,,0,12/28/2022 23:31

TravelHacks,"Greetings travellers,

Hoping to explore part of the Patagonian region on both the Chilean &amp; Argentinian side for approximately 2-3 weeks. I have not booked anything as part of a wider no-booking travel philosophy and so rather than criticise this please just take stock of it when imparting your wisdom.

To provide context, I’ll be entering the region from central Chile (I.e. Santiago), I’m looking to travel relatively frugally (as one can in the Patagonian region) without sacrificing on the quality of experience, and will likely arrive within the next week or two. I’m very interested in hiking throughout this Patagonian stint, and have some experience on this front.

I’ll break my many questions into 2 longer doubt-filled riffs below.

1. Booking/Availability/Recommendations

As aforementioned. I haven’t booked anything, my understanding is that this may limit one’s options with regard to hiking, trekking, general activities upon arrival in some of the more tourist-oriented areas. Would it be wise to skip out on these areas altogether (I.e. w-trek, punta arenas) and bee-line straight for somewhere or something a little lesser-known and less geared towards tourism? If so, please let me know any lesser-known gem spots/treks from past lives. Otherwise, any alternative ideas would be appreciated. I do also have 1 week until my visit, so if you think there’s something really worth booking that may have availability - same thing, let me know.

2. Predilection For Frugality/Cost-Saving Tips/Connections

I travel frugally, and sadly, it would seem the Patagonia’s might disagree with this mode of travel. All in all, it’s probably a small price to pay given the beauty of the region, nonetheless, the inner hustler in me would like to know any penny-saving/dollar-maximising tips you may have for this area - particularly any esoteric, area-specific advice outside of the normal (“book directly, and in person”) sort of stuff. Also, if you are a sociable individual with some connections in the area (i.e. a local tour guide or company) that can offer a good price, or are one yourself - message me directly or shamelessly tout your company in the comments, I welcome either.

I’m self-evidently inexperienced in this part of the world so help me out and if you need more information, let me know.",2 doubt-filled riffs on the Patagonian region.,,Womersli,,0,12/28/2022 22:11

TravelHacks,"My travel guide (applies to all cities):

1. Book a guided walking tour.

2. Check out the places where you can see a top view of the ciry.

3. Look for local restaurants that serve local dishes and avoid the touristy places for food.

4. Book a boat trip (a must)

5. Check museums that tell something about the city.

6. Pick a special scent to wear or music you associate with that city and let your mind make all the associations as you roam, it shall teleport you back later once you've encountered that scent or music again.

7. Take photos that document your experience and not just camera-worthy shots. Take shaky photos, ruined photos, silly photos and some vids too. Playing them back later is very rewarding.

8. Journal about it if you can and mention all the details that grabbed your attention.

9. Get small souvenirs for yourself that you can use in your daily life and not just leave behind stached in some box. It can always remind you of that time.

10. Pick your travel mates wisely.

11. It's always good if you plan ahead, but if not, don't stress and just go spontaneously, walking around the city shall lead you to the places you need to visit anyways. Getting lost is not always a bad option. It means you see more.

12. Pick the stuff you usually enjoy doing and do it in the cities you visit, don't just try stuff you read in must-visit guides and do it because you have to. Some of them are just phony and underwhelming. Ditch that fomo.

13. Pick transportation methods that show you the best of your route as you travel.

14. Check that city's subreddit and read people's experiences and suggestions.

15. If you're looking for random things to visit while you're in the street and done with all your plans, search tourist attraction on google maps and pick smth you like.

16. Have a look on the local/farmer's market and supermarkets there, even if briefly. It's always fun to have a gist of what the grocery shopping experience feels like in a new place.

17. Been doing video commentary of my travels, it works as somekind of a diary if I didn't have the time to journal + captures the moment and my observations better (can make you look weird to other people looking from the outside though lol)
18. Take photos of your accommodation if you liked it.

19. Send people stuff that reminds you of them if you come across any while you roam. It's sweet.

20. ziplock bags are a life saver forreal, get the big and small ones, shall make your life easier.

21. Watch movies in the cities you are visiting, it's entertaining to run into the same spots irl and see how it feels like when they materialize.

22. Stop and read the stuff they write besides monuments and spots you pass, they can look boring and useless, but mostly they give you a quick overview and some of them are actually well-written. I still remember the time I visited Mauritshuis in Den Haag and I could tell whoever wrote them did actually make some storytelling effort because I genuinely enjoyed reading them.

We plan on traveling primarily through local transit/cycling if practical. When crossing countries we plan on using the train. Seat61 has been a great wealth of knowledge. 

Any tips will be greatly appreciated! TYIA",Would love insight on Hungary to Bulgaria,,adinosaurs,,0,12/28/2022 17:50
TravelHacks,"If you’ve traveled with small children or toddlers, I need ALL your hacks please!

Before having my son, I (36/F) had traveled quite well and quite extensively. Most exotic place I’ve been to was Cambodia. The last place I traveled to was Colombia. Now, that was before I met my current partner and father of my child. Also, we met a few months before you know what hit (major epidemic). So I haven’t been much of anywhere since then. Then got pregnant and well the rest is history. 

I’m starting to pick back up on my traveling journey and now I want to take my son. I had Bolivia on my “up next” list. As well as, Morocco, Jordan, and Egypt (this one I can sit on). These places I don’t see myself taking my son so young, I’d likely wait until he’s a little older so he can appreciate the places better. 

Was thinking of exploring the USA a bit more with him now. Thing is, I DON’T KNOW HOW TO TRAVEL WITH A KID. Taking care of yourself, well that’s somewhat easy. But a whole ‘nother human being, let alone a tiny fragile one, is nerve wracking. 

Please, I don’t even know how to start searching for information. I want to take my son to the west coast this summer (Oregon). How do I travel with a toddler? I want to possibly rent a car to drive to Cannon beach and see national parks and stuff. Do I have to take a car seat with me? In the plane? Carry it around?

We also enjoy being out in nature, experiencing some wildlife and being outside. We have a pretty decent budget for traveling to Hawaii (1.5-2k a person) as I understand it can get pretty expensive.

TravelHacks,"Hello,

I'll be traveling to Europe next year in May for 2 weeks and was hoping to hear from people here what and where I should go. Perhaps some must see cities, Airbnb vs hostel, rail passes or one way tickets, and adventures etc.

I'm flying in and out of Lisbon. 
14 days in total.

The initial plan at the moment is to spend 3 days in Lisbon, 3 in Barcelona, 3 days in Naples, and 3 days in Paris, and the last day in Lisbon to fly back to Toronto.

I'm thinking about taking one way flights to go from one city to another. Also thinking about booking Airbnb instead of hostels. I've never stayed in hostels before and always booked Airbnbs.

Please, any help and recommendations will be extremely helpful, and highly encouraged.

Context: I'm graduating and this is a gift to myself. I don't drink and would rather use the money to try new foods, and enjoy both history and scenic places.

TravelHacks,"Not really related to Southwest, but this came up in my mind again. I was wondering if travel insurance will allow us to take an alternative travel plan, cost slightly more but avoid a bigger claim.

A real world scenario happened to me before. I had a short 2-day trip, and my flight was cancelled and got re-booked for another flight next day. This can cause enough disruption in order for me to cancel the entire trip, non-refundable cost is about $500. However, I spoke to the airline and got re-re-booked to a flight one day prior instead, this will cost me only $200 for an extra day of hotel. I took the $200 route. (ps: That was also the time when I realized my BoA Alaska card doesn't have travel insurance, which was cancelled since then) In this case, it is obviously a better choice to go for the extra $200 than losing $500 for both me and travel insurance (if I have any). So I wonder how I can make a valid claim out of this.

I tried speaking to my credit card issuer about this potential issue but didn't get a clear response. So I'm wondering if anyone had a similar scenario before?",Anyone had positive travel insurance claim experience when going for an alternative route?,,connection_lost,,0,12/27/2022 22:48
