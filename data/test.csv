1,Are there any budget friendly ways to get a taste for the Arctic?,bak1n,0,"Are there any budget friendly ways to get a taste for the Arctic? Hey all. Planning on a visit to Chile and Argentina later this year. I was very interested in visiting Antarctica as well but after seeing the $15-20K price tags I nope’d out of that. Patagonia is beautiful but wanting to seek something a bit more frigid. (I’m from the midwestern US, so I’d love to see if something colder exists). 

Anybody know of any ferries or cruises perhaps that make a visit through Drake Passage from the Chilean Patagonia and won’t break the bank? I know it’s a very expensive destination but still willing to review all of my options here. Thanks.",budget friendly way taste arctic hey planning visit chile argentina later year interested visiting antarctica seeing k price tag nope patagonia beautiful wanting seek bit frigid midwestern love colder exists anybody know ferry cruise visit drake passage chilean patagonia break bank know expensive destination willing review option thanks

1,Nice &gt; Rome flights/airlines,efisk1990,0,"Nice &gt; Rome flights/airlines I’m heading to Europe for work in June and want to extend the trip for pleasure. It’s only my second time traveling to Europe (from North America) so I’m clueless about European airlines. I’ll be in Nice, France for work and want to get to Rome. There are flights on Wizz and EasyJet one way I’m seeing for as low as $30! First, as an American, I’m absolutely shocked even a short flight is that low. I haven’t paid less than $100 for a flight in years. Second, are these airlines horrible to fly with? Is there a catch here? Am I choosing the Spirit Airlines of France and going to have an awful experience and never see my bags again?

Hi, I don’t know about you guys, but I absolutely hate whenever my socks get wet, so I’m looking for good waterproof shoes I can also bring for travel.

They don’t look the MOST durable and the bottom traction looks like it might wear out pretty fast just from the pictures.

1,Adding legs to reduce cost,Lambo_J,0,"Adding legs to reduce cost Note: I am NOT referring to hidden city ticketing. 

There used to be a service called FlightFox that I used a few years ago and they kept find inga way to reduce costs on roundtrip flights by adding a 3rd leg.   
For example I needed to fly from EWR to FRA and back direct. I wanted to fly outbound on Jun 20 and return on Jul 2, non-stop only. What they suggested was to add 3rd leg to fly from EWR to SJO on Jul 8th (6 days after my return), and it would reduce the overall cost by 50%, compared to just booking round trip the days I needed. After I returned, I called United to say I couldn't make my last leg, and they even refunded the taxes for that leg.  
They've even been able to find ways to add a completely unrelated flight to reduce costs, e.g. instead of adding EWR to SJO, they might add UIO to SJO as an example.

My question is, does anyone have any idea how they were able to figure out what to add as a 3rd leg to reduce the price? Thanks!",adding leg reduce cost note referring hidden city ticketing service called flightfox year ago kept find inga way reduce cost roundtrip flight adding rd leg example needed fly ewr fra direct wanted fly outbound jun return jul non stop suggested add rd leg fly ewr sjo jul th day return reduce overall cost compared booking round trip day needed returned called united leg refunded tax leg able find way add completely unrelated flight reduce cost e g instead adding ewr sjo add uio sjo example question idea able figure add rd leg reduce price thanks
1,Hotel booking tips Amsterdam,c0d3f4th3r,0,"Hotel booking tips Amsterdam Hi guys,

we want to go to Amsterdam next month (May 18th - May 21st) but aren't able to find any affordable accommodations. The usual Hotel checking websites return unusually high prices above 1000€ for two people and three nights. All other searches returned acceptable prices but as soon as we check the booking website (either from the hotel itself or from third party booking sites) prices go up drastically to again above 1000€. Browser cache has been cleared and still no change. Are there any other websites or any recommendations from you guys? Help is very much appreciated.

Acceptable price range is up to 120€/night.",hotel booking tip amsterdam hi guy want amsterdam month th st able find affordable accommodation usual hotel checking website return unusually high price people night search returned acceptable price soon check booking website hotel party booking site price drastically browser cache cleared change website recommendation guy help appreciated acceptable price range night
