Cruise,My bf and I (from the united states) are going on a cruise this summer that will be leaving from Rome. We already booked it but because we were booking it while being in the US it gave us problems and was saying we have to have a primary guest who is 21 or older even though on the website it states that any cruise leaving from Europe the primary guest must be 18 so we had to call royal caribbean and the employee booked our cruise for us. I wanted to make sure ahead of time that we will not have any issues getting on the ship once we get there since we are only 18.

Cruise,"Me (M46), the wifey (F46) and the kids (M18/F16) returned from what was a lovely cruise on the Carnival Horizon.  Ports of call were Aruba, Bonaire, La Romana (DR) and Amber Cover (DR).  We went on excursions at every port.  The kids has their own room across the hall.  Wifey and I did the Capitan's Table dinner on Day 2 and the La Romana excursions without the kids.  There were tons of people coughing everywhere on and off the ship.  Thankfully, we are all vaccinated and boosted. Pfizer and Moderna mix for me.

I started to feel soreness in the throat on Friday (Day 7 - Amber Cove) and fell into full blown sickness (akin to a really bad Flu) on the following Tuesday.  I took a home test and a PCR test which both came back negative,  By Wednesday I started to feel better and was back to normal on Thursday with a little cough and fine today (Friday).  I thank my vaccinations for making my COVID journey fast and relatively easy.  

The strange thing is that my wife got sick but HAS NEVER tested positive. She took the same home and PCR test as me, on the same day and they both came back negative.  I cannot rationalize this.  Her sickness followed mine by one day.  Her symptoms are very similar to mine but she is having a slightly worse time than me (two days really sick).  She's starting to feel better now.

I'm a 22M travelling solo and I really want a balcony room. All prices are for balcony. I've been going very in-depth on different options, but I'm not sure which option here is better to cruise to Alaska:

&amp;#x200B;

1. NCL Spirit - Leave Vancouver - Skagway/Hubbard Glacier (No Glacier Bay)- End in Seward (7 Days Total) - $1,085 out the door.
2. NCL Jewel - Leave Vancouver - Skagway/Hubbard Glacier/AND Glacier Bay - End in Seward (7 Days Total) - $1,690 out the door.
3. Sapphire Princess - Round Trip Vancouver - Includes Glacier Bay and a few towns - 7 Days total - $1,443 out the door (mini-suite available for $1,690).
4. Holland Westerdam - Roundtrip Seattle - Stevens Passage/Hubbard Glacier (No Glacier Bay)- 7 Days total - $1,620 out the door.
5. Crown Princess - Roundtrip Vancouver - Icy Straight/Hubbard Glacier (No Glacier Bay) - 11 Days Total - $1,656 out the door.

I'm sort of leaning towards Princess or NCL but I'm uncertain what I want to do. I'm really not big on the whole formal thing and I really like NCL's flexible dining/flexible kind of ""do what you want"", but all the reviews and thing I'm reading online is that Princess is usually a better experience?

Cruise,"So my family and I (2 parents, 1 older brother, and myself) are going on the Holland Cruises to Alaska mid-late May of this year. I booked an Oceanview for the 4 of us for $2700 on Holland Cruises but now I'm not sure if I should have shelled out an additional $1500 for a Balcony on Princess Cruises. My parents are in their mid to late 50s and my brother is in his early 30s while I'm in my mid twenties. This is my family's first time taking a cruise and we wanted to go see Alaska in the summer. 

I heard Princess cruises has more of a younger crowd than Holland Cruises but is that true? Should it influence my decision that much?

Also is the additional $1500 for Balcony worth it? $2700 for 4 ppl for an Oceanview seems like a steal to me but my family has always been financially conservative and that $1500 could go towards plane tickets in my mind. We won't be going with any kids.

We don‚Äôt know our check-in time yet (still months away). We hope there will be enough time between checkin, lunch, spa.

Cruise,"On my bucket list is a world cruise.  (This obviously won't happen until both my wife and I retire.)  My goto cruise has always been the [Oceania 180+ day world cruise](https://www.oceaniacruises.com/2025-around-the-world-cruise).  For me, one of the factors was the presence of inside staterooms which would save us some money.  (We're less interested in the ship's facilities and far more interested in the number of ports, etc.)  Some years the route they take goes far off the beaten path, which makes it even more interesting for me.

I've never been all that interested in the quick round the world cruises that are about four months long.  And Viking's world cruise with balcony rooms as the minimum just seemed too expensive.  So the Oceania cruise hits my sweet spot.

So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the announcement of [Royal Caribbean's 274 day cruise](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/ultimate-world-cruise/).  On a per day basis, it seems to be cheaper than Oceania's.  (Yes, the food and inclusions won't be as good.  But it's even more ports, etc.)  But this is the first time they're offering such a cruise, and they may not due it once we've retired.

But I've seen some stories about some extended (longer than a year) world cruises that don't seem that expensive.  They spend more time in port, and less time at sea.  This means more time to explore.  But when I try to find out more about them, my Google skills fail me.  From what I can tell, these cruises are longer than the ones above, but shorter than the [Storyline ship](https://www.storylines.com/) which basically is designed around you owning a condo on board.

Me and 3 others (young 20s) are planning on going on a cruise in September (dates 9-17 specifically). We‚Äôre deciding between 2 cruises.

Harmony of the Seas and MSC Seascape.

We‚Äôve obviously done research and Harmony of the Seas is the superior ship in general (lots more to do!) but we‚Äôre also first time cruisers and don‚Äôt really know what we‚Äôre missing out on.

I recently looked into MSC, and it is a LOT cheaper around the dates we‚Äôre looking at. Again, it‚Äôs a way different ship, but it‚Äôs a lot cheaper and it‚Äôs going to ports (Cozumel, Ocho R√≠os, Ocean Cay, and The Cayman Islands) we find much more intriguing than the Royal selection (Basseterre St Kitts, Charlotte Amalie, St Thomas, and Coco Cay).

Essentially, it‚Äôs better ship and reputation versus intriguing ports and cheaper price. What would you guys recommend for a first time cruiser? Are the ports for MSC really better than the Royal ports?

Cruise,"Not sure if this is allowed but I had to share my experience somewhere so anyone looking to do this cruise at least has some insight.

**Context:** I've taken a few cruises in the last 6 years. I'm not a cruise expert in the least sense but I'm familiar with what to expect. This one was for a bachelor party of a group of seven for a 5-day cruise out of Miami. In total, it was roughly $2000 for me and my friend to split a basic cabin together. Given the fact that we were expecting tons more out of a no-kids cruise, we were pretty disappointed, but there were great aspects of it as well.

**Aesthetics:** For the most part, the cruise was clean and very stylish and trendy. They designed all the bars and restaurant to really feel different from each other and still maintain a sense of luxury. The rooms are really cool, and they come with a tablet to control the TV, the air, and the lights. It also comes with presets to change the lights for meditation, sleep, and even one for sex. The bathrooms were tight but despite its size, the shower inside might be one of the best showers I've ever used on a cruise - let alone on vacation. Very soothing. They had some exclusive cabanas on the deck to rent, which looked cool to do if I came with my wife.

**Food:** Literally the best thing about the cruise. It was definitely a plus that all restaurants were free to dine at, with the exception of premium menu items but that didn't bother me one bit. Best ones were the Experimental Kitchen (Gastro) and Gunnbae (Korean BBQ). Although the general cafeteria was sit-down and time-consuming to wait for food, everything tasted beyond my expectations. A big plus for quick eats were the pizza cafe and the hot-dog bar next to the arcade/game room. Didn't get to try the ice cream bar but saw a lot of people eating them. Overall, if you hate cruise food, this one will definitely blow your mind.

**Drinks:**  Service was fast and great, but nothing really stood out in terms of quality. What's cool is that every restaurant/lounge had a few exclusive drinks, and while some were hit or miss, nothing stood out to me as a must-have. Also there is no drink package available. You can buy a bar tab and they'll gift you a free $100, but there's not much way to ""save"" money when you drink - although they're reasonably priced. What is a huge plus was that they had drink stations at the cafeteria where you could get water, juice, or soda 24/7. They also had some unique cafes with premium coffee but you had to pay for those. 

**Activities:** The biggest let down of the cruise. We paid a premium for a cruise with no kids and there were no risque activities at all. All the events were mostly wellness events (morning yoga, understanding your gut health, etc), or too cheesy/cringe such as a 90s boy band dance lesson. The most exciting one was a dodgeball game which they only held twice, and everything else was meh, such as the puzzle speed building and trivia. They had a painting-while-you-drink class but you had to pay for it, and it was sold out by the time I boarded the cruise. Aside from that, I thought it was cool that they had a few events for solo passengers to get to know each other and participate in activities. But beware if you're expecting tons to do - I had to find ways to entertain myself by bringing my journal and sketch pad. 

**Arcade/Game Room:** I don't spend much time at the arcade on a cruise. If I go it's only on late nights when I'm bored. This one had a decent arcade filled with a bunch of retro machines that were all free to play. They had a 2 racing games but weren't connected for co-op. Best part about the game room were the two long table shuffleboards. They also had foosball and a huge selection of board games. 

**Karaoke:** Probably the 2nd biggest let down of the cruise. For Virgin having all this ""you're a rockstar"" vibe and energy everywhere on the cruise, I was expecting an entire auditorium or club dedicated to karaoke. Nope - they had a shitty PA system set up in the same hallway where the arcade was. The worst part is that they held it right outside of the Steakhouse restaurant, so when I dined in there, I could hear the blast of terrible singing through the doors. They *did* have a few rooms for private karaoke, but there was no one tending to the station when I checked it out so that was a waste of time.

**Clubs/Shows:** This is the cruise's wheelhouse. Their main club ""The Manor"" is a fully-equipped club with 2 stories, lasers, fog machines, dancers, and plenty of lounge areas to chill when you're not on the dance floor. My only complaint about the clubs and parties is that the music sucks. The majority of their songs were essentially EDM remixes of popular songs. The shows themselves had really great production value for being cruises. My only observation is that these shows are definitely geared for the LGTBQ+ crowd, so you'll see a few performers in drag. I don't care about it at all but if you or someone you know isn't comfortable with that, then there's your warning. I'd also like to point out that at the lounge at the center of the ship, they have a few bands play there and it's an awesome post-dinner vibe.

**Casino:** I'm not a big gambler, but the casino was pretty solid. In addition to the usual slot machines, there were $10, $15, $25, and $100 tables of blackjack during the casino's peak hours. They also had roulette and craps. I was disappointed because there was a $1/$2 Texas Hold'em Tourney at 10pm, but it ended up being a digital poker table that seats 12. It was extremely easy to look at other people's cards because of the way the table is designed so I stopped playing midway because it was pointless.

**Gym/Fitness:** This is the other part the cruise nailed. The ship has a track on the top of the deck for people who like to walk, jog, run. It's pretty small but I enjoyed getting a morning run in with in the middle of the ocean - very refreshing air. It's also got a small basketball court that lights up at night where they also hold the dodgeball games. In the actual gym area, they have a ton of workout machines and equipment to use. They also had a small boxing ring on one side of the deck and outdoor fitness structures like bars to do sit-ups, push-ups, etc.

**Other:** They give you a wristband with a plastic module before you board the ship. That's how you enter your room and pay for your drinks. I'm not a fan of wearing accessories, but I thought it was extremely convenient to not have to worry about misplacing a room key. What's also cool is that the Virgin Beach Resort in Bimini functions the same way. Saves the hassle of needing to bring cash and all that to buy drinks. The resort itself looked very nice and clean, but again, there wasn't much to do aside from going into the water or lounging. Side note - **the app fucking sucks.** When I tried using it before and during the cruise, it would constantly crash and setting the reservations was a mission. I get what they're trying to do with it, but they need a better system for that.

**BOTTOM LINE - Scarlet Lady is the perfect cruise if you're looking for something more low-key and relaxing with your partner. Don't expect the raunchy festivities like the commercials make it seem. Granted, everyone brings their own energy to the party, but even with no kids this ship, it failed to meet the hype. It's definitely not worth paying the premium in my experience, but it definitely proved that cruises can have amazing food and drinks.**",[REVIEW] Virgin Voyage - Scarlett Lady,,alexdoo,,0,2023-03-27 21:00:40

Cruise,"I just got off the Carnival Paradise yesterday. This was my first cruise since 2016. I've done pretty much all the main lines Carnival, Royal Caribbean, NCL and Princess. Also, my first one as a parent of a five year old.

Overall, we had a great time. The ship is older and smaller, but it was fine. We did a few things to save money like each brought on one bottle of wine (don't forget the corkscrew) and a 12 pack of pop. I can certainly live without pop for a week, but having it was super convenient. I've gotten the Bubbles package before and I found it actually a little annoying to have to go to the bar and get a drink. This way I just used the (not really great but worked a little) fridge in my stateroom and grabbed a can on the way to meals. 

Let's talk meals first. I had Guy's Burgers three times and I thought it was great. I love cheeseburgers though. I read somewhere else that the quality is like of Chili's, which is fine because I enjoy Chili's. I also liked the pizza and appreciated that they gave you a half personal pizza because I really can't eat that much. We ate dinner each night in the MDR and I didn't really care for it except the first night when I had like a chicken parmesan dish. My husband liked most of his though.

One pet peeve I do have is how hard it is to get a freaking peanut butter and jelly sandwich. That's one of the only things my kid will eat and you could only get it through room service (extra charge - nearly $6 for PB&amp;J) or at the MDR. The MDR was OK, but my kid is still really young and getting him to sit still after a long day of water slides and swimming was a challenge. Next cruise, I am literally just going to bring packets of PB and J on board because I can always get bread from the sandwich station. I would understand if they don't do PB&amp;J because of allergy issues, but they had it out for breakfast for the bagels, so that's not why.

We also had a mini-suite stateroom (specifically V1) and the size of the room was good and nice closets and layout. However, the balcony was not private at all. It was awkward sometimes because we would be sitting there and someone would walk by on the stairs and see us and do a double take. I will definitely be more discerning with picking the stateroom next time! 

The ship amenities were great for families. I saw tons of kids (I think it was FL's spring break). The ship has five water slides and a splash pad area. The two smallest water slides are perfect for preschoolers. My husband and I even went on the big water slide to encourage my son to go on it, and we thought it was fun. The pool itself was freezing, which has been the case with every (3) cruise I've been on. The hot tubs by the pool area were like kid soup (it said no kids under 6 so thankfully I kept my kid out of it). The hot tubs in serenity were kid-free though. I did see a Carnival crew member chase out some noisy teenagers from Serenity so that was appreciated. My son also loved the min-golf and kid's club. You cannot go wrong with childcare included (until 10PM then it's a flat hourly rate) on the vacation. He only went for a couple hours a day to socialize with other kids and give us a break.

Alcohol is a lot more than I remember. I think it used to be like $10 a drink, now it's $15 for a daquiri. I didn't mind though because I had my wine I brought and I'm a light drinker. They have lovely lime edible straws and chocolate straws in the coffee shop which were nice.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good. My last Carnival cruise was ten years ago and I still think they are fine. I did expect some cuts in things because of post-COVID life, but it was fine. I can see us making plans to go again in 2024 as well.",Carnival Paradise: March 2023 Review,,loveskittles,,0,2023-03-26 16:39:31

I called several times with no luck, in March I booked another cruise for April and due to the payment schedule had to pay it in full. End of March I finally get the cruise credit, and guess what? Because the cruise is paid in full I can‚Äôt use the credit anymore. I sent several emails trying to escalate to a manager and have the credit converted into on board credit but no one answered the email. Finally I tried one last thing and DMed celebrity on twitter, they answered within hours. And by the following day they approved a one time exception to convert my credit to on board credit.

Cruise,"Hello Alaska cruisers!  My wife (35F) and I (41M) are looking for an Alaska cruise, and thanks to the posts and advice I've seen on here, I've landed on Princess being the likely best option for us.  I think I've found the itinerary we're aiming for, but I was hoping to get some thoughts from others who may have done this before and would know things I do not.

**The Itinerary:** Vancouver &gt; Ketchikan &gt; Juneau &gt; Skagway &gt; Glacier Bay National Park &gt; College Fjord &gt; Anchorage (Whittier), mid-May 2024

**The Ship:** Sapphire Princess, Princess Cruises - Balcony Room

**Itinerary Features We Care About:**

* Well-rounded itinerary with a taste of the highlights for Alaska cruising
* My wife *really* wants an opportunity to see the Northern Lights
* We like to see and learn about nature but won't be broken-hearted if we don't see wildlife
* We like to explore the history and food of port towns we haven't visited before (we've never been to Alaska)

**Ship Features We Care About:**

* Okay, don't judge too harshly, but we've mostly cruised Carnival in the Caribbean; for Alaska, we wanted to go with something higher-end because we are tired of something always inevitably being broken or not operating correctly on the ship that should absolutely be taken care of (like A/C or heat, or obvious signs of the air system not being cleaned, which has also made us nervous about cruising on older ships)
* Good meal offerings included with the fare (main dining room, buffet, ice cream, late night options) because we never really took too much interest in specialty dining
* A good WiFi plan is a bonus, but not a necessity
* Coffee bar!  And we like to enjoy an alcoholic beverage once in a while, but we typically don't exceed 1 drink/day each.  Bonus if there's sweet champagne or sparking wine.
* Other fun activities during downtime like karaoke, trivia, movies, live music (we saw an electric string trio - two violins and a cello - on a ship once that we absolutely loved!)

In reading reviews and comparing what I've seen online, Princess seems to check our boxes for satisfaction in food quality and casual environment, experience in cruising Alaska, and we were super interested to hear about Princess bringing wildlife and nature specialists on board to talk about the natural environment we're cruising through.  We were pretty confident that we didn't want to go with Carnival or RCCL, because we wanted to find a more ""premium"" experience for Alaska.  HAL and Celebrity, for some reason, didn't strike me as the vibe we're going for, but I could be off the mark there.  My other consideration was NCL, but they seem to have a lot of extra stuff we don't care about, and reviews I've read suggest that included meals aren't great, and that there's a lot of nickel-and-diming to coax you into buying premium packages instead.  But again, I could be wrong.

I'm super confused by several comments in cruising threads about Spring Break and children. Comments that you should expect more children during Spring Break cruising.

For context I've just recently returned to cruising after a 20+ year break and have a cruise this Sunday on NCL Bliss.

Also for the record I don't mind children at all. I'm a child at heart myself really.

So do children have a spring break nowadays? I think of college kids when I think of Spring Break as when I was kid back in the 70s/80s we only had Summer Break from June to end of August. It wasn't until I was in college that I had a spring break, which in those days was Ft. Lauderdale and MTV beach parties (shout out to Ed Lover).

Cruise,"Good morning everyone!

 I'm taking my first cruise this May on NCL and I'm super excited. I'm big on budgeting and haven't really planned for the excursions, and now i see that the majority have early start times only (730a) and I'm not too thrilled to get up and directly go on an excursion. I plan to do one and take advantage of my $50 excursion credit. I was wondering if there are any people out there that have forgone the excursions and made their own plans or booked experiences, and if so how was it and what did you do? And do you have any tips or opinions on this? 

Stops: St Thomas, D.R Amber Cove, P.R San Juan. 

Any opinions or tips are much appreciated!

Went back and forth on deciding on stateroom for ages before selecting one of the whirlpool grand suites. We‚Äôre not very peoplely and I wanted a space we could relax in privately. The room was $4k for a 7 night cruise. 

Today we got offered to bid on an upgrade. Either a yacht club with deck view (significantly smaller room/deck than what we have, no hot tub) for $500 per person. Or one of the duplex whirlpool suites (still a smaller deck) for‚Ä¶ $2k per person. 

The numbers aren‚Äôt adding up. The yacht club room with a deck was only $3.5k total if we went with that option originally. The duplex was $6.5k. With bids we‚Äôd be paying at minimum $5k or $8k total. 

Obviously we‚Äôre not gonna bid on the upgrades, but is this normal? Do they offer the same minimum bid to all non-yacht club staterooms?

Cruise,"Hello All!

Sailing on Norwegian Escape 5/21-5/28 and made the now-regrettable decision to allow NCL to book my flights (before coming on here and reading how bad of an idea that is).  I very much got a Jekyll &amp; Hyde itinerary: the return trip is totally fine (a direct flight FLL-PHL on American) but the incoming trip is a nightmare: 2 Southwest flights with a 70-minute connection in Atlanta, and not arriving to Fort Lauderdale until 12:15 on embarkation day.   

Obviously I did it to myself by not deviating to arrive the day before, and will likely bite the bullet and just book a flight to arrive earlier, it's just too risky because if I miss the connection, I likely miss embarkation.  But I'm also aware of the whole ""if you no-show, the rest of your flight tickets will be cancelled"" policy.  My question is: since I'm ticketed to fly back on American and not Southwest, would American even know if I didn't fly the Southwest flights?  The two airlines are NOT codeshare or partner airlines.  The flight info from the other airline does show up on each airline's itinerary, but I figured that was more for convenience's sake from the reservation system.  Currently there's no inexpensive options to fly back on the 28th so I'd rather retain the original return flight and wouldn't want to forfeit the return tickets, but getting to the cruise/embarkation is the higher priority!  

And yes, I did already call the NCL Airline reservation number about asking for a less-tight connection time and got the ""too bad, so sad, can't do anything"" spiel from the agent since it's less than 75 days until sailing.","NCL Air: Booked on 2 separate airlines, is a partial no-show possible?",,rdevlin92,,0,2023-03-23 21:23:29

Original Post: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/vgs5ic/you_think_norwegian_will_refund_us_missed_cruise/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb


I just have to say, Norwegian customer service when it comes to refunds is beyond a nightmare.

I‚Äôll start at the start‚Ä¶

We reached out to customer service via the phone/email. They kept just telling us to go to AirCanada customer service, which then then in turn just told us to go back to Norwegian. 

After this annoying back and forth for about 2 weeks they finally gave us this refund form to submit. Which of course was denied  within 1 day.

We responded to the denial since it came from an actual person and they responded about a week later (with corporate jargon but it pretty much said:) they spoke to their higher ups and still settled on no refund.

We then had to find fine print (ON OUR OWN) that referenced something along the lines of ‚Äútaxes, excursions, and any prepaid credit will be refunded for a missed cruise‚Äù.

We sent them this to which they responded after almost a month (and with us having to follow up) and they agreed with and offered us about $1000 cruise credit‚Ä¶ (about $4000 less than we spent).

This was still unacceptable to us so I went and sent emails to every employee I could find to explain our situation‚Ä¶. I went on LinkedIn and found all of the customer service managers and emailed them directly.

We heard nothing‚Ä¶

We then decided to go all in and make a bluff. We sent the rep in the denial chain an email mentioning that we would be pursuing legal action (listed a random lawyer and everything), it was very legit looking.

And guess what!!!

2 days later they offered us a full refund (in cruise credit, as well as an upgrade to our room when we rebook). Which we accepted and rebooked our honeymoon for this summer. A week long Alaskan Cruise in the biggest family suite!

So moral of the story, screw Norwegian Customer service, legal threats are the best bet, and we still love ya Norwegian cruises.",Follow up post! (You think Norwegian will refund us? (Missed cruise due to delays/cancellations) ),,WakeAndWin,,0,2023-03-22 22:44:41

Today I got an email offer from the Blue Chip Club regarding a comp ocean view cruise offer for some sailings in May/June, mostly European ports. 

Logistically, only a couple of them are workable options for me, none for my partner. I have a few questions that I‚Äôm hoping someone who‚Äôs experienced or knows a bit about could provide some insight:

1. If I pass on this offer this time, is there a chance another will come around in the comings months/year+? Asking because typically the second half of the calendar year is usually the best time logistically for us to make things happen, versus spring.

2. Does anyone have an idea what the rough cost/% discount is (if any) extended to the guest of primary sailer if I would take advantage? 

3. Do Captains Club points accumulate on casino comp‚Äôd cruises? My assumption is no, because comp, but figured worth asking to take into account.

I ask these because it was pretty light on details outside of requesting passenger info &amp; cruise preference for a future call to schedule.

Cruise,"I absolutely love going on cruises, I personally find them to be my favorite form of vacation. Why take a flight to Bermuda when you can just cruise there, not have to worry about finding a place to stay/places to eat, and party the entire time on the way to and from?

Although I understand that it's not really for everyone, and unfortunately for me most of my friends feel that way. While a lot of them have been on cruises (with or without me) before, some just would prefer another type of vacation.

I've always been keen on meeting new people, especially me being in my 20s, to travel with but I was surprised to find out that cruises are not really looked at as an overall ""enjoyable"" form of vacation, at least in the eye of the general public. I always tell people to try at least one cruise and your mind will change, and for the most part it has worked, but I can see that I'm more of a cruise ""enthusiast"" than my other friends.

Which leads me to my question. I always keep an eye out for good deals on cruises and when I find one, I usually have no choice but to let it slip by as the majority of the time I can't find people who want to go. Whether that be because they're busy, don't want to spend the money, don't like cruises, are ""scared of the Titanic"", I've heard every excuse in the book. I would love to find a platform where I can meet some other young cruise enthusiasts who are also keen on hopping on a good cruise deal when presented with one!",Is there a platform to find people to cruise with?,,BoyBrandeenoo,,0,2023-03-22 20:43:47

Cruise,"I‚Äôm a college student who is doing research on potentially going on a cruise line over the Winter Break (some time between December 2023 - January 2024). All of us would prefer to go on a cruise which has a similar age demographic to ours (early-mid 20‚Äôs). We would all prefer to go on a cruise during the Winter, as most of us will not be able to financially afford a cruise until later this year, and the warm weather would be a nice reprieve from New England.

An article that I recently read (linked below!) stated that is that cruise lines generally attract younger passengers during the warmer seasons (Spring/Summer Break), and that during the colder seasons the cruise lines mostly consists of elderly folk.

Given that many colleges offer Winter Breaks, are there any time slots during the Winter in which there is a stronger presence of college students? I recognize that there are other variables to consider (the cruise line itself, the regions, etc.), as well as the fact that cruises broadly already lean towards older folks, but I would still like to know how the seasons, if at all, impact the age demographics of cruises.

Cruise," Just got back off of Carnival newest ship the Celebration, and boy oh boy is it a mixed bag. 

First things first, there were 4 of us in a family harbor suite me and my wife (mid 30's) and our two kids (7 M, and 22mo F). 

The room was adequate and had plenty of storage. The beds were comfy in the hotel kind of way. The only issue with the layout was with the door to the room being making it very hard to get our stroller in and out on port days.

The cleanliness of the room left much to be desired, as my little one found leftover peanuts from the previous guests on the first night in the room. These were just loose on the ground not in a package or anything like that. As time went by I also found where some soda had splashed one of the cabinets and had dried into a syrupy mess, also there before we got the room. The bathroom doors handle already had several screws loose and was coming away from the door.

The bathroom itself was cramped, but the shower had plenty of room and I never felt crowded will showering (I'm a larger guy 5'9 230 lb), but that did come at the expense of the rest of the bathroom which felt very crowded. 

My son enjoyed the water slides on the back of the ship, except for one which was always out of service (the drop slide), and while he was not tall enough to ride the Bolt roller coaster it wouldn't have mattered since it was down for maintenance most of the time. However he ended up spending most of his time in Camp Ocean where he had a blast.

my daughter on the other hand enjoyed her time, but was not as well taken care of. Celebration offers ""Turtles"" level of care which is 0 - 1. This was a big selling point for us as we have cruised with Royal and they have nursery care as well. The hours for this care however where horrible. I tried to look up the hours before the cruise but they were not posted anywhere.  On sea days they would watch her from 8am - 10am (maybe), and 10pm - 1am, and on port days it was 3-4 hours of the port stay but off set in away that you would miss about half of the day if you used it (we did not), then the 10pm - 1am all of this at $9 hr + tip. Considering how much of a selling point this was and how much Carnival was hyping it up this is disgraceful. While I'm not saying we should be able to drop her off all day, the availability made it impossible for me and the wife to have a nice dinner or catch one of the shows just the two of us. This was not an issue on Royal.

The food was a mixed bag. The main Dining room never had anything that made me go wow, except for their melting cake desert. However Guys burger joint was wonderful greasy goodness, Big chicken and some of the best chicken I have had in a long time, and The Pig and Anchor was amazing as well. The steakhouse was not good or worth the extra charge. We skipped the seafood restaurant. The ""pop up"" street eats where always good, and I love the idea of a new small themed snack everyday. I ordered the Seafood shacks buffalo shrimp one time, and while it was made to order and very good, it was not buffalo. It was more of a thai chili sauce. The pizza was good late night food and always a kid pleaser. Deco Deli's  sandwiches where all good as well. The sushi Restaurant was hit or miss, but that is not an thing I normally do, and my wife loved everything there so take that for what is worth. The Japanese steak house was wonderful, large portions of good food with a light hearted show to go with it. However the best food hands down was at Emeril's. Everything was amazing, not a bad thing on the menu.

The Casino was there. I am a big Crapps player, I enjoy the atmosphere and getting to know the other players. Carnival did not make this easy. First off it was a $15 table (other lines are $10, they said it was a big ship tax...), second only about a third of the dealers knew what was going on( this caused 10 plus min waits between rolls sometimes ) and they would constantly misplace your bets or not pay you out right. This caused issues, and regularly spoiled the atmosphere at the table. Third pretty much anything goes with the dice. Throw it just over the halfway point on the tabe no where near the back wall, no issues. Toss the dice over everyone's heads, no issues. Hit people with the dice! As long as the dice landed back on the table, it was all good. At one point in time someone threw in their money and card as the shooter was throwing and got hit by the dice and it was counted. I stayed because it was the only game in town, but never again.

And we have to talk about the kids. At all hours of the day and night there were packs of kids roaming the Lido deck, buffets, and other halls. Most of the time this was not an issue, however when it was it was because a 15 -17 yr old where fighting in the buffet (Carnival did not break it up, and this ""play"" fighting bumped into several other guest as well as knocking over a small child) or a group of 10-12 yr olds running through the halls bumping into other guests screaming profanities the whole time. I don't know the solution to this but I will not be coming back so I don't have to worry about it.

Overall the staff were always kind, except for one person who gave me an ""that's not my job"" when asking for replacement silverware. Apparently their shift had ended, but they were still in full uniform.",Carnival Celebration 7 day out of Miami review.,,RogueGuardianStudios,,0,2023-03-21 01:56:55

Cruise,"I have a situation that I can't find answers to anywhere online.

My brother booked a solo room on Norwegian. At the time, the cost for his solo room was around $1500 total ($599 cruise fare). A few weeks ago, a friend decided that they were going to go. We called and added him into the room, but the fare had nearly doubled to $1,029 (Please see image for cost breakdown.).

Now, the friend does not have the money to go on the cruise. He is looking to not have to pay at all. No payments have been made aside from the $125 deposit at the initial booking. If we were to remove the friend, would my brother still be expected to pay the full *current* price, or would he be reverted back to his original price? I know there is the worry of a solo supplement, but I'm just a little confused since he was originally solo, but with a much lower rate.

Cruise,"Ahoy! Currently on the Oasis of the Seas and just had two very weird instances where I felt beyond confused. 

My husband and I always get the unlimited dining and drinks package just because we love the specialty dinings. We‚Äôve always been under the impression that once you have the dining you can only reserve once you board the ship, which is why this time we boarded as early as allowed and beelined to make reservations only to find out you could do it via app. However, previously I had called and had always been told otherwise that I would be charged etc since the app doesn‚Äôt recognize the meal package. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is how have you guys done this before with the dining packages?

Also for the a la carte how does it work now? Nobody in the ship seems to know if the $20 stipend is per day or 1 time use.

Cruise,"The NCL website isn't exactly clear enough for me personally on what the luggage rules are in comparison to airlines. Ive gathered this from their FAQ which feels very vague to me: 

How many suitcases can I bring?

\- Each person is allowed up to two pieces of personal luggage on board, with each piece weighing a maximum of 50 pounds

Should I bring on a carry-on bag?

\- Guests should bring a spare overnight bag because all suitcases are collected the night before we return to homeport.

‚Ä¢ Luggage that is being hand-carried must be able to fit thru the x-ray machines, similar to airplanes if larger than that it must be checked. (Approximately 24‚Äù tall and 18‚Äù wide)

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I really rather avoid checking in my luggage. How much carry-on luggage can you get away with? Would we be limited to only 1 carry on bag per guest or can I have a carry on back and a personal bag (like a backpack). Its a 1 week trip so I don't think I need a full suitcase really.

Cruise,"Hi ya'll, just wanted to share my experience on the MSC Meraviglia. This was mine and my wife's 3rd cruise and first on an MSC ship (the other two were Carnival and NCL). We're in our 30s, but the family group we were in ranged from 20s to 70s.

Right off the bat, the lines. From embarkation to buffets, it seemed we spent a good chunk of our vacation in lines. And the drink and bar lines were unacceptably long. We're talking waiting upwards of 30 minutes for a drink. This was a spring break cruise, so I understand it's a bit more of a booze heavy cruise, but they were still much too long. My family and other passengers were not happy, and you could kind of tell it affected the entire vibe of the cruise. 

They also straight up ran out of drinks. On the Ocean Cay reserve, their signature island drink that was plastered at all the different bars was gone by 10:30 am. The island wasn't even hopping at this point. Speaking of the island, the line issue followed us there. And they closed different bars without any seeming rhyme or reason. It seemed anywhere you went, there was a hourly rotation of what's available and what's not. 

Back in the cabin, we purchased a bottle of wine for the room. It was there, it was overpriced for what it was (which is fine, I knew going into it that it would be), but it was a corked bottle. So we had to call down to the desk to get them to open it with a corkscrew. They never showed up. So I said forget it, and just waited the next day to call at a non-busy time. This time, someone actually showed up to open the bottle but it was apparent that this was the first time they've used a corkscrew. It took about 10 minutes for her to open it, and by the end the cork was a mangled mess with bits of cork floating around the bottle. Wolverine would have made cleaner work of it using his claws. Why not just give us a fucking screw top? It's already a whatever bottle of wine, who gives a fuck if it has a screw top. 

Other negative notes: Buffet was confusing, the casino had a pitiful amount of table games, music and deck parties were just kind of generic. 

The good: I actually liked the food. The room was designed nicely, but it wasn't very clean when we boarded (house keeping forgot to clean one of the desk draws and it had old candy wrappers in it). I liked the pools on the ship as well. Oh and the F1 simulator was fun as fuck. I wanted to be like Kimi but I spun out like Mazepin. 

Folks, this post has gone on long enough but I could keep going with the complaints. To sum it up, the service was so bad that it amplified every other issue we had. I'd say if they hired more people, it would solve a lot of their issues. But I don't think they will. Look at my comment on the casino: Very few table games. Why? You need dealers to man those tables. If they're not even willing to hire extra staff for a guaranteed moneymaker like casino table games, there's no way in hell they're hiring more people to give you drinks you've already payed for.",Cruise Report: MSC Meraviglia 3/12-3/16 (It's not good),,ChicagoToAVL,,0,2023-03-20 20:19:38

Cruise,"Me and my GF were meant to go on a Norwegian fjords cruise on the Queen Mary last year. This is our very first and possibly only cruise. We were concerned about getting covid on board and having our holiday ruined (this has happened to us before and it wasn't pleasent) so we pushed it back to this year, same itinerary but on the Queen Victoria instead.

Anyway, I was looking up more information on the Victoria and was alarmed to see a lot of recent negative reviews for Cunard on tripadvisor. A big chunk seem to be about an incident where the Victoria was dry-docked for three days for repairs which is whatever, but I'm also seeing a lot of people saying the cruises across all ships have degraded noticeably following the covid reopening. Bad food, the ships are run-down and dirty, and the staff seeming overworked and exhausted are the common complaints.

This has me reconsidering (I've only paid the deposit, don't have to commit until August) as this could be a once in a lifetime experience for us and I'd hate to be let down. I'm also not really comfortable supporting a company that's mistreating their exmployees. And I'm disabled so I guess I'd have safety concerns about being on a ship that's under-staffed.

Has anyone here been on a Cunard cruise in the last few months? Are these complaints true, or are people just being salty about the dry-docking incident? (Even some of the reviewers that weren't on the Victoria cruise in question were bringing it up, which kind of made me suspicious that people were review-bombing the cruise line).

It was a fairly cold day in NOLA and we get on board and get into our room. The room had the thermostat turned to cold so we turned it up to heat.

It's colder in our room than the chilly air outside. The hallway is warm. He calls maintenance and I check back at 30min and at an hour. He told me to also call guest services.

Cruise,"Currently on adventure of the seas 4-night Galveston to Cozumel and back with wife, 3 kids (3,5,6) nanny and mother in law.  Have two 2-bedroom grand suites.  

Tldr:  can't get more than one ounce of whiskey and bottled water hard to come by.

Wasn't planning on drinking much anyway since I am with my kids but when I want a drink I like a decent-size glass of Irish whiskey on the rocks.  Nothing special needed - Jameson is fine.

Day 1, after finally getting let into our room, I have  15 minutes free with wife to get a drink in bar in promenade and I order a double Jameson on the rocks.  Bartender says no doubles and pours me literally one ounce in a glass.  Once I figure out he's not joking I say fine and drink it quickly and order another (time is limited) and he tells me I have to wait 10 minutes for my safety.  I don't blame the bartender I'm sure he's just following rules but Jesus Christ.  I'm a 42 year old grown man and don't need my already limited consumption throttled by policy.  I'm not some spring break kid.

Come to find out it is this way at every bar here.  

This is psychotic.

I've only been on one previous cruise, ncl in January 4 nighter out of Miami.  Had haven 3 bedroom garden villa.  No comparison on room, which is to be expected, it cost substantially more.  But if I went to any bar there they would make pretty much whatever I wanted anytime.  If i ordered a double Jameson and it lookeda little light I asked the bartender to fill it up some more and they would.   I don't think that's too much to ask.

Also, bottles water on ncl were abundant and always available everywhere it seemed. Here it is difficult to find.  Ended up paying $65 for two cases from room service so family wouldn't dehydrate.

I just returned from an 11 night on the Constellation and am happy to say Celebrity far exceeded my expectations and had many delicious offerings.  From the feedback I got on my last post and that I‚Äôve seen on Facebook groups, there does seem to be some consistency issues between boats/sailings, so hopefully they continue to work on that.  But for the most part, we had good to excellent meals (especially in the Tuscan Grille and at Le Petit Chef).  Room service was much better, maybe now because it has a charge (edible, warm eggs!).  I will say I think they still aren‚Äôt so great at ‚Äúcomfort foods‚Äù (was unable to find a tasty Mac and cheese and the nacho/queso and refried beans should be thrown overboard), so keeping to more specialized options seems to work better.  The Indian is still amazing though, that was the highlight of my lunch buffet each day!

I will say I was also blown away by the service on the Constellation.  The crew was truly superb and went out of their way to make us feel special and to ensure we were enjoying our trip.  The crew really set our experience apart and way above any other cruise we‚Äôve been on.  We ended up with a norovirus outbreak and the crew immediately did everything they could to stop the spread.  I even saw the activities director walking around cleaning surfaces!  By the end, we could tell the crew were exhausted from extra cleaning/serving duties but they still kept the same level of service.

Honestly I was so shocked at how bad the food at Lido was. It was on par with eating at Golden Corral. 
Additionally, I don‚Äôt drink that much alcohol and just getting simple water or soda water was SO DIFFICULT. I know this was the first completely sold out cruise since Covid, but it seemed like the cruise was miserably full. We‚Äôd stand in line for 20 minutes just trying to get a small can of club soda lol. Not worth it for the cheers package. You also have to wait 5 minutes to get any drinks back to back, even water! 

One coffee bar on this ship for nearly 4,000 people. Those girls are amazing and need a raise lol. Churi and Kareen busted their asses constantly for their entire shifts. Good job ladies üòç

For the room, our king sized bed was two twins put together which was horrible. We were on deck 2 in the aft area, which was quiet and the room was a good size. The shower fit us both and we enjoyed the bathroom size as well. We had a fridge and asked for a fan, which was brought within 12 hours. Definitely a must, because the rooms can be stuffy. We had a window, but our family had an interior room and I definitely would recommend against that if you‚Äôre claustrophobic at all. 

Gym was adequate. I was hoping there would be decent stationary bikes, but there were 2 working ones that were very old. The free weights were nice. Be prepped that if you‚Äôre an avid gym goer, it was packed with people who clearly had no clue what they were doing on the first day or two. Then it starts to fizzle out and the last couple of days, the gym was empty. 

They nickel and dime you to death. I‚Äôm not going to pay an additional 20-50 bucks for dinner just for something acceptable. $10 for a photo they take with you at dinner, and the excursions had a lot of hidden fees or required extra money for taking photos. We went to half moon cay and the gift shop was closed and conveniently the Cheers package didn‚Äôt work so we had the lovely opportunity to pay $17.50 each for a watered down margarita. There are a total of 4 water stations on the ship, all located on Deck 9 near the buffet. 

How is there only one hot tub for adults? There were kids in the hot tubs outside of the serenity bar, and so you basically had to just hop into the one at the top with like 15 other people. The adult serenity area was overly populated with young 20-something‚Äôs just getting absolutely hammered, so not quite a serene or relaxing experience. 

Karaoke was not a live band. I‚Äôve been on another carnival cruise (the Fantasy/Legend, I think) and it was a full on band playing the songs in a large lounge. This sunshine ship just has the karaoke in a small pub or area by a pub with speakers. Mid experience af. 

THE BEST part of the cruise was our tour guide in Nassau! Perry and Mary with Divine Servants tour guides. Extremely affordable, large and clean van, the guy knew so much about the history and culture of the Bahamas and he was a native that had grown up in the poorer area and worked hard to succeed. Totally recommend to everyone. 

Overall, I‚Äôm not so impressed. The service was great for the amount of crazy spring break kids but the food and opportunities were not worth the price. I think it‚Äôs a great cruise for those that really enjoy shopping at Walmart and their idea of a good dinner is chilis. 

This experience just turned me off of cruises for good. I‚Äôll spend the same amount of money flying to Hawaii or across the pond. ‚úåÔ∏è",Carnival cruise experience and thoughts.,,TheGildedDildoArises,,0,2023-03-18 16:31:01

Before even getting on the ship, the security checkpoint was just full of older people who looked miserable for people about to begin a 12 day vacation. We had some few rude encounters with people on the ship unprovoked (like I said, they were older). We were on a family vacation with our parents and my grandma and her sister, so my parents and my brother were probably the youngest ones on the ship. I'm 20 and my brother is 17.. we were the youngest ones there (besides the crew who were more or less my age). They lost our luggage and we didn't get it back until late that night. The food often came cold or raw. A lot of employees were very kind and I had long conversations with some, but others were just straight up rude, especially in the shops. The ship moved a LOT which isn't necessarily their fault but it's still uncomfortable to deal with. I got my hair blown out at the salon and they left it a MESS... super frizzy and dry. I had to go back in and ask for them to redo it (which I hate doing but it was just so bad). There was also nothing to do. Everything was shut down by 10 pm. The shows felt like high school theatre productions. Like I said, a lot of the staff was very kind and accommodating but that's all I can really give this cruise.

Hope everyone is well.

About to bite the bullet on my first cruise - it's only a mini cruise out if England end of September, it goes over to Ireland and back. 

Given the time of year, I expect the weather won't be particularly good (hopefully it stays dry at least)... Its more so that we want to experience a big cruise ship, and then hopefully book a proper one round Europe/Carribbean at some stage over the next couple of years. 

My question is, will the pools on board the Virtuosa be heated? I know there is an indoor pool, but will the outdoor pools still be a decent temperature - or will they be freezing because they rely on the sun?

- Can travel agents book the Yacht Club? (Not a cabin option on cruisecompete)
- (Pending space still available) Can I upgrade later to Yacht Club for the price difference? Would it be the price difference based on what I see now or whatever it is when upgraded (ie, booking for $4k now, Yacht is $8k, if in future Yacht is $9k would it be $4k or $5k extra?)

Cruise,"I posted recently about being interested in going on a cruise for the first time in 2024, and I want to go to the Norwegian Fjords, ideally as far north as possible. I don't want to fly so I'm looking at departure ports in the UK. I've looked at various options and Fred Olsen looks very nice (and one of their ports is only 30 minute from home) but expensive particularly for a solo traveler. For a cheaper price I could get a longer cruise in a better cabin with P&amp;O - and having a private balcony to read, drink tea and admire the scenery really appeals to me. 

But online reviews for the P&amp;O Arcadia, which is the ship I'm looking at, are mostly pretty negative. Does anyone have any recent experiences? For what it's worth I'm not a demanding traveler and most of my holidays are spent camping in either a tent or the back of my minivan, so I think having a bed and a hot shower is pretty luxurious in itself.

Cruise,"At 29 I'm going on my first cruise in December, on RC Odyssey of the Seas. It leaves out of Ft Lauderdale, going to CocoBay, Haiti, and DR. I've been on 3 all inclusive vacations in my life- so far to Punta Cana twice and Cancun once.  


To be honest, I think I'd rather do that again just based on the cost benefit analysis, but my friend group really wants to try a cruise. So I'm just wondering for those who have done both, how do they differ? Because from what I can tell;  


With an all inclusive vacation say to Punta Cana, 2 people can go to a resort for 6 nights including flights for about $1200, to $1400. And you can genuinely get away with not spending another dime while having a luxurious time. All food is included, including several different restaurants for classy meals or the buffet for casual. Wifi is included throughout the resort. Of course, alcohol is included. You tip at your discretion, and a couple of dollars here and there goes a long way. There is live entertainment every night.  


On this cruise, it seems like everything is an upgrade and has an extra cost on top of the $1600 already paid. Wifi is not included, need an upgrade. Alcohol is not included, need a drink package. Many of the food options on board are not included, need a package. Tips are mandatory and added at the end. You need to fly in a day early and get a hotel, there's another $200. So while an all inclusive can be about $1000 per person when all is accounted for, if I want to drink on this cruise then when you account for everything it is more like $2000 per person.  


So I'm not bashing on the experience as I have never done it before, I'm just genuinely curious do you feel the experience is twice as good as an all inclusive island vacation?",How would you compare a Caribbean cruise to an all inclusive vacation to one of the Caribbean islands?,,Life123456,,0,2023-03-17 13:05:03

Cruise,"I booked my first cruise on MSC 3 weeks ago and was/am pretty excited. Since then I‚Äôve been getting more stressed and worried about the cruise. 

First is the poor quality of food and lack of bar service that I‚Äôve been seeing posted. Food isn‚Äôt too big of a deal for me, I consider myself a human garbage disposal so I‚Äôll try anything as long as it tastes decent. However, paying for the drink package I truly hope I don‚Äôt regret splurging because bar service is slow and I‚Äôve heard they don‚Äôt have waiters coming to take drink orders at tables. 

The most frustrating part so far is their awful website and bad customer service. When I tried to login to my account after booking I got an error, gave it a couple days then decided to call to try to fix it. After on hold for 30 mins the person couldn‚Äôt even help me, they said it‚Äôs a ‚Äúglitch in the system‚Äù which I found out to be untrue, it‚Äôs because the emails differed from my account and booking so I had to make a new account for my booking. I couldn‚Äôt edit or add the email linked to my booking to the account I created. The customer service agent also told me the ship is sailing out of manhattan NY, which come to find out it sails out of Brooklyn. Thankfully I noticed or they could have messed up an entire travel day. 

A few days after I situated my account (with no help from customer support) I noticed the price of my cruise dropped over $100. I searched online to see if they price match and I got mixed answers, half say yes they‚Äôve done it the other half say no they don‚Äôt. So I called customer support again. The agent said she was not seeing the cheaper price I was and to send screenshots of the price I‚Äôm seeing to their existing booking department‚Äôs email so they can fix it for me. 

A week goes by, I didn‚Äôt hear anything. I emailed again asking if I am going to receive a reply. Another 8 days went by. Today I got an email that said in 2 sentences they don‚Äôt price match and I have to cancel and rebook to get the lower price. Problem is, because they took TWO weeks to reply I am paid in full and my cruise is too close to cancel without penalty. I emailed back and asked if I could have a supervisor contact me because I would have cancelled and rebooked if they didn‚Äôt take 2 weeks to reply. 

I have seen great reviews of MSC and some not-so-great ones. But, even if this cruise is paradise I truly don‚Äôt see myself booking with them again.

Now, as I finally go to book something and redeem the credit, they tell me I can't use it.  You can only use the credit if you pay ""full fare"".  No one ever pays ""full fare"".  There is always some promotion going on to make you think you are getting a great deal.  If I paid ""full fare"" and used my credit, it would cost me so much more money than booking without the credit.  It's a scam.  Total scam.  NCL should be ashamed.  They spend the entire week promoting this like it's the best thing ever, raising more money from raffle sales and even offer a last minute raffle sale, building the hype,  so you get in the drawing for the FREE CRUISE.  They drag out the number reading, like it's the power ball lottery.  Then, they hand the winner a piece of paper with a bunch of exclusions.  You can't go on these days or these ships.  It's got to be an inside room and a maximum of a 5-day cruise.  Blah, blah.  And, oh, you can't give it away.  And, oh, they can change the rules at any time.  So, one of the ships not listed on the piece of paper was a no-no.  They built the ship after the certificates were printed.  You can't go on one of the newer ships.  Doesn't matter what the paper says.  Also, you must redeem and sail within a year.  I ""won"" mine last September and I still can't find a legit cruise to redeem it on.  I'm so angry.  Next time I cruise, I'll give those damn raffle tickets to someone else.  I'm so angry, I told my husband I'll find some ""free"" cruise they will allow and book it just to block the room and I wouldn't actually go on the trip.  Oh no, you still have to pay fees and taxes on that free cruise.  So, now I guess I just frame my certificate and get absolutely nothing out of it.  It's such a scam.  I can't believe that NCL can find people to work for them to deal with the ""winners"" like me.  They must be ashamed of the lines they feed day in and day out.  All they do is say no all day.  Sorry, those are the rules.  Sorry, not that ship.  Sorry, not those dates.  Sorry, no........ 

If you've gotten this far, thanks for listening.  Free cruise, my a$$.  How is this not public knowledge?  I will never sit through that drawing again, hoping to be the lucky winner.

Cruise,"So, I don't know if this discount exists to begin with, when I booked with this person on the phone via Princess, he claimed that he would provide me a residence discount, as I live within the same state as the port (FL).

 He also claimed that this supposed discount would be BIGGER than a military discount (which is also something they do not offer anyways), and I can't stack discounts- fair enough, no problem.

I looked at the payment to book, I have yet to make a deposit on my booking, and I do not see any applied discount. I called Princess asking about this discount, I was put on hold a bunch of times and even hung up on before they made me go back to the initial person I booked within half an hour (i was trying to avoid him because he kept trying to give me to purchase things I did not want),

 I asked him about the residence discount, and he claimed that the discount was applied and insisted that because of my residence, the discount also applied to my guest. The price was the SAME as the initial cruise price (499) taxes/etc included, so despite how that made no sense to me, I basically didn't question it further. 

 Shortly after the phone call, I conducted a mock booking with the same exact cruise and date but used an address from a state that wasn't specific to Florida, the total was exactly the same. 

Can someone just answer the question as to whether or not this 'residence discount' even exists? I don't feel like wasting my time to dispute a discount that the agent claimed exists but didn't apply it.

I have been trying to book the restaurants through the princess app and it keeps trying to charge me $35pp for the reservation. I‚Äôve called now two times. The first agent told me that he would have to escalate it as he doesn‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs charging me and someone would call me back.

Once during disembarkation, the cruise director (who I had not met to this point) thanked me by first name for travelling with them.

Question is, does the cruise line review who has booked with them, and do they bring any passengers of interest to the attention of the crew?  

Or was this possibly related to me having booked an upgraded stateroom, and staff try to have awareness of these passengers.

Or does the cruise line monitor social media activity and make a note of positive passengers during the cruise?

Immediately, I searched the room for any other misplaced items and then handed them over to guest services. Thankfully, no harm was done, and we've had a great trip so far. However, I can't help but feel concerned. If the date on the prescription is accurate, it indicates a long period of inadequate room cleaning.

To their credit, Carnival did attempt to make amends. They performed a deep clean of our room and even provided us with chocolate-covered strawberries.

The idea of hours spent sitting on a balcony looking at beautiful scenery, drinking tea and reading a book with food and drink on tap seems idyllic and very relaxing. 

But I'm a quiet, introverted kind of of person and I'd be traveling solo.

   * \+ The ship looks awesome and is new, probably would also be less kids, cool ports even though it wasn't our original plan 
   * \- Considerably more expensive, not a fan of the infinite veranda idea, worried that some of these port visits will require quite a transfer to these bigger cities, many Italy ports which wasn't really on our list

Cruise,"Hey cruisers, was hoping to get some insight on how to manage getting to the port traveling by car.

I have done Disney in the past to the Manhattan port, used a Hotel with a Park and Cruise package, unfortunately the only hotels with that package are fully booked.

Plan is to travel day ahead and I would greatly appreciate other options. Right now I have:

1. Stay in Newark (cheaper hotels) drive to port and park there at $45/d x 7 nights
2. Stay in Newark park in some local lot (about $15-20 /d x 7 nights) then Uber both ways which looks like $80 x 2 so $160.

Any stay closer quickly doubles the hotel and parking rates but would save a little on Uber.

I would greatly appreciate ideas that I am unaware of, for example this is a MSC cruise, do they have shuttles from the Airports?

Cruise,"Hi everyone! I am looking to book a cruise for next month (I know it is last minute!) And I was hoping you all could give me some insight because I have not been on a cruise since I was 15.

Originally, I was planning to book a 5 night cruise with Royal Caribbean that stops in Cozumel and Coco Bay. I have been particularly interested in Cozumel, so this seemed perfect! Other than that, I planned to just enjoy lounging in the sun, reading, and exploring the food and entertainment on the boat.

Then, I read that Royal Caribbean is a much older crowd and it seems that many of the posts about young adults on cruises point to Carnival. Now, I am not a big drinker/partier, but I would explore the bars/nightlife a little and I definitely want to meet people around my age (say, around 40 and under?) since I will be alone. 

I looked into Carnival cruises from my desired port and there is one that is 4 nights. It stops in Nassau and Princess Cays. Personally, neither of these locations interest me that much. I have been to Nassau before and the animal excursions that would normally interest me seem rather unethical. So I would probably just sit on the beach or stay on the boat. Of course, the Carnival cruise is cheaper as well (by about $400) and I would save money on excursions. I am in school while working right now, so that makes financial constraints important (and limits my flexibility for timing).

So tell me... does the age/vibe difference or the price difference make it worth switching to Carnival? If the boats matter, I am looking at the RC Mariner &amp; Carnival Liberty.

He liked going even if he was often alone with the leader. He would play video games mostly. 

The entertainment was mostly bands playing covers. They were quite good. There was also comedy shows which my son and I loved. 

All in all we enjoyed it. Very different vibe from the Royal and Disney cruises we had done before!

Cruise,"  

**Check Fare Prices Often:** It is a very good idea to book early. Yet still check your pricing for your cruise often. If those prices go down, prior to final payment, you can leverage that to benefit you. Save money by rebooking, gain On-Board-Credits, and sometimes stateroom upgrades.

**Check Your Credit Card Cruise Perks:** Like anything you need to read the fine print. That said, I usually book a suite and get as much as $300.00 of on-board-credit and dinner for two at the French Restaurant when traveling on NCL. Other brands also have perks. I call this, free money. 

**Research the Pros/Cons of Who To Book With:** Every option has pros/cons. The number of debates online of what is best can become hostile at times. The best solution is learned about them all and make the decision that best suits you and your needs. I book with a very high cruise producer who also provides me with my American Express Platinum Cruise Perks. 

**Fly Into Port at Least A Day Early:** This is yet another point for debate. When you fly in the day before there is a cost for hotel. It might also cost a person a paid day at work to fly in early. I have done both. It only took one time of being so stressed that it effected my first two days on the ship, that I ALWAYS with no excuses come in the day before. I even do this when I can drive to the port if the drive is 3 hours or more. 

**Cruise Travel Insurance:** You only need life insurance for your family if you die. Since you cannot predict when that might happen, most families hedge their bets with life insurance. Cruise Travel Insurance also hedges your best of financial lost. For some like me, I need this coverage because my health insurances do not work outside the U.S. Like every product, you can get basic, medium, or high-end coverages. Take the time to read what each one does and choose what is best for you. When researching, please consider a Cruise Travel Insurance Company to do your research and comparisons. Remember, cruise brands are experts at cruises, not insurance. 

**Cruise Brand Provided Airfare:** This is usually a bargain or at least saves you some money. One piece of advice I gave above was book way in advance. This also allows you to book airfare on your own, even a fully refundable fare at the same or close to what the cruise brand is offering. You are in much more control with a decent refundable airfare then booking with the cruise brand. This is a huge topic on all cruise social media sites. My humble advice is book it yourself, select your own seats, select your connections, get all your airline points for the trip and in most cases, you can get the first piece of checked luggage free. 

**Reserve Your Specialty Dining Reservations Early:** If you have specialty dining on your next cruise, each brand has a date you can book those reservations. Mark that date on your calendar and get the reservations as early as you can. Use the cruise brands processes and procedures to your advantage. 

**Cruise Drink Programs:** Each brand has different policies for their Adult Drink Program. The mistake we all seem to want to make is justifying if we can drink enough to gain value from the program.  In the old days, you could buy a wine bottle package; that was it. At the end of the cruise, you would get your ‚ÄúDrink Bill‚Äù under the door. This happens to me only once. The bill was **HUGE**. Now most fares come with a drink package or a upgrade to a drink package. If you drink at all, consider it. If you don‚Äôt drink period, skip it. However always remember, you are on vacation. Doing ‚ÄúDrink Accounting‚Äù every day is not everyone‚Äôs idea of a good time. Yes, like a casino, a cruise brand will always make money on their drink package. 

**Check Your Stateroom Portfolio Daily:** Make this a habit because errors happen. Those portfolios are not the easiest things to follow if you only look at it the last day. Fixing it on that last day at Guest Services is also a hardship because everyone is doing the same thing at the same time. 

**Passports**: Your passport usually must be valid for 6 months after you last day of the cruise. Check your cruise brands rules. Passports take a while to gain or renew so please don‚Äôt wait to the last minute. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap that you can go on a cruise with only a certified original Birth Certificate. In many cases you can but the pitfalls can be huge. Get your valid passport early and be done with it.

**When To Board:** Again, an often-debated preference. I always follow the cruise brands rules to gain the earliest boarding time available as soon as I can get it. I want through security, in the terminal, sitting in front of the door that they let you board through even if I am sitting an hour or so early. Less stress for my family and me. Many say they prefer to board late, after the crowds are through. I can also see the benefit of that. Just not my approach.

**Day One Lunch:** Many go to the buffet which is fine if you are on the ship early. If not, the buffet can be crazy crowded. Go on to your favorite Cruise Social Media Site and ask the frequent cruise brand guests the best venue for that first lunch. All I am suggesting is have a plan. Remember, you carry on is with you initially because the staterooms are usually not ready until 01:30 PM.

**Stateroom For-Sale Items:** Have the room steward to butler take these items out of your room. The are expensive, sometimes old, and just the cruise lines way of making a few more dollars.  Recently, the crew put the items up in a closet in the stateroom rather than removing them. Each cruise line has different policies. These items have shown up on my stateroom portfolio when I did not use them. This is again why checking that portfolio daily is important. 

**Pre-Pay Gratuities:** If you intend to give your crew gratuities, just handle it upfront. One less thing to think about.  If you are in a suite with a Butler, that butler might not be part of the Pre-paid gratuities program. Know the rules and policies of your cruise brand. 

**Beware of Third Part Deals:** There are a lot of Discount High Volume internet cruise brokers. You see a fare less than the cruise line offers often by a big amount. Be very careful here. Look at the fine print and compare to what might be deleted from the other fares like with the cruise brand or a successful Cruise Agent. When things look to good to be true, they usually are. Do your due diligence and have peace of mind. 

**Read Reviews:** The best approach disregards the folks that say everything was perfect or everything was awful. You want a honest balanced review. The verbatim comments are incredibly important. One little hint. When you read post on a social media blog that focus on a specific brand, watch out the brand frequent cruisers. These folks tend to be very, very loyal to a brand. The can be harsh when anyone says something less than complementary about the brand. Remember what you want is real world realistic guest experience. Lots of them. 

**Avoid Holiday‚Äôs/Special Dates:** I used to cruise Thanksgiving week. I stopped and went the week after Thanksgiving. Less crowded, less money, more room in the pools/hot tubs, and easier to eat when you want. If it is a popular date for any reason, see if you can be just a little bit flexible with your dates. 

**Pain Killers:** Aspirin or Tylenol is NOT usually sold in the normal stores on the ship. I had to learn this the hard way. You can go to the ship hospital but that can be very expensive. 

**Social Media Does Not Create the Cruise Line Policies:** If you want accurate information about something really important, ask the cruise company. Many people as the question in a social media blog. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times the information was not correct and the guest paid the price. Some area‚Äôs are passport rules, drinking age, can I cruise when pregnant, can my friends not in the VIP Suite area come in, and the list goes on and on. My rule, if it is important, get your information from the source. Don‚Äôt be lazy.

**If You Gamble, Check with The Cruise Line Casino:**  I have gotten percentages off and free cruises.  Just takes a phone call.  

Hope I helped, add some thoughts of your own.

We have a weeklong cruise coming up soon. Unfortunately, for the last 9 months, my young, healthy, skinny, no medical history husband has had an as-of-yet unexplained illness that at one point landed him in the hospital for 5 days (acute respiratory failure) He‚Äôs been evaluated by countless specialists, had diagnostic procedures to try to find the cause, innumerable lab tests, but so far: no answers. 

He‚Äôs not contagious (negative for *countless* various pathogens) no fever, etc but he has intractable sinus congestion, and laryngitis because he coughs. Incessantly. 24/7 for the last NINE months. Refractory to every single medication and treatment known to man. 

He‚Äôs now being treated as if this is all a new autoimmune reaction, either related to his Covid vaccine or Covid illness a year ago.  But so far, still no relief. 

And while he doesn‚Äôt feel anywhere near 100%, he says he wants to still go.  Feels the salt air and water might help. But I can almost guarantee he‚Äôs going to get stares, comments and most likely, reported to the sick bay. 

I‚Äôm planning to bring copies of all his medical records, imaging discs, and a suitcase worth of medicine (poor guy goes through 1 bottle of Robitussin per day despite it barely making a difference).

A bunch of weird stuff that we are noticing and questions about the cruise and MSC can't help us on the phone.

Cruise,"
Sorry if this is basic but I‚Äôve scoured prior posts and got nothing. 

I booked a family NCL trip for five adults and four minors, into four rooms.  Three of those ‚Äúadults‚Äù are under 21 yo.  I made the bookings with a TA.  

Now that it‚Äôs time to check in, I just realized the rooms aren‚Äôt linked in any way.  I had to create a new login (email and password) for each room.  Then it wouldn‚Äôt let me put my credit card info for these other rooms (I guess it wanted a card with some one in the room‚Äôs name?).  And now looking at excursions, I would have to log into each account and book them by room (but I don‚Äôt know how many seats are left so don‚Äôt know if they could accommodate the whole group).  Worse, I bought the air from NCL (I know, I know‚Äînever again) and they booked us all as separate passengers so one of us has a different itinerary.

Is this really just how NCL does things? Should my TA have done something different so I could put all this under one account?  I‚Äôve done a few other cruises but never booked more than one room.  What a pain!

Cruise,"I came here a lot when we were planning and asked for some advice which I greatly appreciate! 

We just wrapped our 5 nights on Celebrity Summit. This was my first cruise, my partner‚Äôs second (first on celebrity). 

We chose Celebrity because of the food and reported atmosphere on board. It did not disappoint. 

We booked aqua class and I ate at Blu every single night for dinner. We had the premium drink package and greatly enjoyed the freedom to drink without worry of price and lived for the coffee at Cafe a Bacio. 

The buffet was good for lunch as I‚Äôm not a huge lunch eater and mostly got a few plates of snacks including hummus and pita, a slice of pizza, and nachos. 

The burger at the pool bar was yummy and hit the spot on a sea day. 

Overall, Blu was worth the upgrade to aqua class and generally enjoyed all my other options as well. 

The service was incredible. Every crew member we interacted with was kind and helpful. Our drinks were great and I appreciated the excitement and personality of everyone on board. The staff at Blu exceeded everyone else however. Truly cannot rave enough about that experience. 

I was worried about being bored but I got into the spirit and went to some game shows, music, and shows in the theater. I enjoyed the variety. Most were nothing to write home about but gave some variety to the day and mostly it was the other cruisers we interacted with that made the experience better. 

The ports were fine. I enjoyed our Cozumel excursion but I wasn‚Äôt impressed with Cozumel if that makes sense. Nassau was much better. VIP beach day at Blue Lagoon was amazing. 

Our bed was comfortable, plenty of spaces every day to relax, my massage in the spa was amazing, and I found myself enjoying a slower pace of life for a few days and really appreciating the work the crew put into our experience at every turn. 

10/10 recommend, would sail again but maybe skip Cozumel, definitely will always boom Aquaclass.

Cruise,"I am on the last 2 days of a 14 day cruise originating in Singapore, excited because this would be the Westerdam‚Äôs triumphant return to Asia.

Unfortunately, this trip has not been what my large group of 10 had hoped for, and we have heard from so many others that they also feel this cruise fell short on so many fronts.

For example, even embarkation at the start of the cruise was a mess. Many of us had 30+ travel time to make it to Singapore for the cruise. At no point did they inform us a COVID test was necessary‚Ä¶. Until 18 hours beforehand. It was not on any of the cruise documentation, the Navigator app, or VERIFLY. In fact, none of us knew until we waited 45 minutes in line, got to the front; then were told we had to find tests. 

There were dozens of others like us. Thankfully, they were able to provide tests, but it would‚Äôve been nice to have had that handled or know about the requirements before we showed up. After we texted, we had to get back in line and wait for another 45 minutes. Whether or not you had VERIFLY (which was supposed to expedite the process), you had to still wait in the same line.

On board, the experience with the housekeeping staff and dining staff were pleasant, but that‚Äôs about it. Guest services has been beyond abusive to anyone asking for help. They inform you via stateroom TV what is required at your next port of call, but the instructions are scant and if you have questions, god help you. You will be waiting in line for 25+ minutes only to be met with surly staff who do little more than tell you to figure it out. Given the average age on this ship is 65+ with few tech savvy people, this is disappointing.

The Westerdam staff also do not see it as their responsibility to inform their guests of procedures required until the very last minute. For example, we attended a port talk for Ishigaki where it was expressly said rbere were few taxis. The shore excursions were sold out. So, I purchased an independent tour for 10 people for the next day, leaving the ship at 9am. Given arrival was scheduled for 8 and giving us an hour to disembark, we figured this was plenty of time. Instead. We learned at 4pm the night before that immigration procedures would not BEGIN for our deck until 10:30am. 

The tour was non refundable. The time could not be modified. How could this happen? We were able to request priority oases but the procedures did not begin until 830. Meaning, we all missed our tour and lost out on $800. We never would have booked it if we had known. 

No entertainment on board except for some cut rate Backstreet Boys and an awful comedian. Nickel and diming for every little thing - shuttles at each port are overpriced at $25pp and don‚Äôt even take you to the central areas.

Cruise,"RC cruise planned for June '23. Birth certificate for child shows gender as female but reservation is made for male - Child's gender is male. Name, birthdate, everything else on the BC is accurate, only the gender is incorrect to our RC reservation. Reservation says male, BC says female. Wondering if RC and/or US Customs is goin to prevent us from boarding. 

And before we go down the path of ""WeLL yOu ShOuLd HaVe CoRReCtEd ThE BiRtH CeRTiFiCaTe"", let me explain where we're at. 

I separated from my son's mom several years ago. Getting a copy of his birth certificate was on my list of things to do, but never at the top. When we booked the cruise, I knew he would need his BC. I ordered it, it came, we're good. But the gender reads as female. I contact his mom, we notarize some papers and send them to the Department of Health. The processing time is 30 weeks. Best bet, I may get his amended BC by August in time for him to go back to school. 

I've called the Department of Health. They are currently processing orders that arrived in January. They do not have a process to expedite requests. The request isn't in the system yet. Their best bet, in April the request will hit the system. Until the request hits the system, nothing they can do. 

Looked into getting him an expedited passport using a BC his mom has. However because his BC is being amended, the only one we have on file is going to be invalid once the request hits the system, per the Department of Heath - haven't confirmed with Passport officials. 

Lastly, I called the US Customs office in the Port of Miami. The Customs Officer I spoke to said ""we only care the authenticity of US citizens, not their gender"". This sounds like wonderful news. My concern is getting that answer today and having a totally different experience once we get there. 

We have until April 5th to cancel. To summarize, our TA contacted RC who said to contact Customs and figure it out. US Customs is saying NBFD,  Department of Health says IDK LOL until sometime next month. Maybe a passport, if everything literally goes perfectly and timely. 

Anyone have experience dealing with this? Not really interested in opinions on gender and BC and as I was told by the Department of Health ""let an officer pull down my 7 year old's pants and see what happens"".

I‚Äôm single and the few friends who I‚Äôd enjoy traveling with have busy lives that likely wouldn‚Äôt let them come with me. I‚Äôd be happy if my mom came with, but she is unsure because she thinks Norway is going to be visually very similar to Alaska and it‚Äôs a long way to travel if it is (we are in the Midwest). This is aside from the obvious cultural difference there will be,  she is specifically thinking about the landscapes. 

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who has done both an Alaskan and Norwegian Fjords cruise and their thoughts on this. 

I think I would still go regardless as I‚Äôm very independent and have always wanted to solo travel. 

Also, I‚Äôm considering going on MSC as their prices are fantastic compared to everyone else. Thoughts on that cruise line? I‚Äôm very introverted, so will likely keep to myself more than anything. I just want to relax, experience Norway, and eat some decent food.

Cruise,"Hey there all. I'm hoping to go on a cruise that includes Hawaii. Since I've only ever cruised NCL, PoA is where I'm gravitating toward first. I'd be really excited to do a week long cruise around the islands!  
The current price for a balcony for a single cruiser like me is \~$5K. This is a little bit more than I expected but I started thinking of it as a 'next year' cruise to save up for.  


Until today, when I checked prices again and saw that a 7 day cruise in just about 1 month from now is like HALF the price at around \~$2500. I was expecting this to be a 'sail away' only price that wouldn't include things I've come to expect on NCL (open bar) but was pleased to see that it is a normal balcony price, including the 'free at sea' perks...  


So, 1 month from now is a LITTLE sooner than I was planning on taking another vacation. I'm curious if this sort of thing might repeat in the future. Is it the case that possibly the '1 month from today' cruises of this ship will continue to be markedly cheaper like this one is now? I recognize that there are other factors tat play and nothing is guaranteed, but if I could push this cruise another 3-4 weeks and still get a good price like this it would be great!  


So, any of you have any idea why this week might be so cheap? If it's just because it's a '1 month from now and we're not sold out yet' price, could I expect this to continue for a few more weeks?

Reason being, I‚Äôve got to complete a Federal background check for employment purposes, and that includes disclosing all international travel outside the continental United States, specifying where I was and the dates I was there.

The problem is, Carnival doesn‚Äôt archive their itineraries beyond the name of the vessel, the sailing date, and basic customer service options in the event they deal with an upset cruiser.

Royal Caribbean has been helpful, they provided a basic itinerary, I just need to fill in the dates.  Our last cruise was just pre-Covid with Norwegian, so that one was easy enough to locate on our end.

Is there someone in this community that documents cruise sailings and destinations or anything like that, who may be able help me accurately find this information?  These cruises were in 2005, 2008 and 2011.

Cruise,"My sister and I recently started cruising and really enjoy it. It seems like many (most?) dedicated cruisers have a preferred line, but we decided to try different lines/ships until we decided we liked on or two significantly more.

So far, we've tried RCCL's Brilliance of the Seas, NCL's Getaway, Carnival Magic, and an upcoming trip on MSC Meraviglia.

We really liked the way Brilliance was laid out, it seemed like there were plenty of individual ""spaces"", not necessarily separate rooms, but areas that felt self contained. Getaway seemed to have more areas continually flowing into each other with little separation and we weren't as big of a fan. Food has been good on all 3 lines, though I personally loved having Guy's Burger and Blue Iguana Cantina. 

We normally sail out of Tampa or Orlando, but could get anywhere in Florida if we wanted. We're not huge ""party"" people or in need of a lot of nightlife, more preferring ""family friendly"" stuff like trivia and shows than bars and clubs.

Cruise,"Cursing in a couple months on a port heavy European cruise, didn‚Äôt spring for Haven because I wasn‚Äôt sure we‚Äôd take advantage of the perks being so port heavy. So then I was thinking the vibe beach club sounds right up our alley and honestly on a Caribbean itinerary I wouldn‚Äôt think twice‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm questioning if we‚Äôll take advantage enough to make the cost worth it.. just shy of 600 total for the 10 days.  

I had it in my head to try for the pass for the one sea day (probably like everyone else and their cousin) but now I‚Äôm wondering if we don‚Äôt just do it for the full time and make it a point to try and visit when we aren‚Äôt off the ship. We are 2 adults, mid thirties, no kids, don‚Äôt want to fight for a deck chair when/if we want one. We‚Äôre on the breakaway if that makes a difference! 

If you did the vibe, specifically on a European cruise I‚Äôd love your thoughts. Did you use pre/post shore excursions? Is it a place you could just go to hang out (would you want to?) what was the clientele like?  Did you feel crowded or was space available when you wanted it?

Some additional info:
- They are similar prices in the end (Holland has slightly cheaper balcony prices but more expensive excursions, so it evens out). 
- They both go to Glacier Bay National Park, which is on my bucket list! The main difference in the itinerary is that Holland goes to Sitka whereas Princess goes to Skagway.
- we have a few vegetarians and a few allergies to accommodate (I mention this because we've had bad experiences on Carnival cruises for this in the past).
- We are ages early 30s-60s, a mix of adventurer types and relaxation types when it comes to cruising (no partyers). We are excited about the whale watching and hiking/nature walk excursions!

Cruise,"Just had a not so great experience with booking through Royal Caribbean.  Family vacation is coming up and I booked two rooms through the RC website, checked boxes for connecting rooms, and got rates.  I took the guaranteed rate (the cheapest rate), meaning that they pick the rooms, not me.  I didn't care what deck we were on, why spend the extra money.  I just needed connecting rooms.

We received our boarding docs a few days ago and we did NOT get connecting rooms.  But here's the kicker, one room actually was a connecting room, it connects with a stranger's room, and the room next to the stranger is our second room.  So we're not connecting AND we're not adjacent AND we're not immediately across the hall from each other.  And there's just one room between us but they cannot simply swap our second room to make everything right because that room was selected by someone.

So.... called customer service, made my case, and the ship is full, there's no other options.  But sweet Gabrielle with customer service did point out ""well, you did get a connecting room for one room just like you requested...""  Right, connecting with a stranger... 

After talking it out with a supervisor and getting the same result, I went to plan B, can we adjust the rooms where my wife and I are in one room and our minor children are in the other room.... no, we cannot.  Because we are neither adjacent rooms nor rooms directly across the hallway...

This isn't going to ruin the vacation, but it's an idiotic frustration because we booked months ago and there were certainly connecting interiors available.

Cruise,"Hello all,

As you may have noticed there‚Äôs been an uptick in the number of lines offering long term cruises and live aboards.  Well they don‚Äôt get it. 
I travel a lot.  I was a captain for a cruise ship.  I would never want to go on a 6 month cruise and I would never want to be shackled to the ship.  What I would want is a line that offers me a condo onboard, but I can come and go as I please and on top of that I can rent out my unit when I‚Äôm not onboard to make a little passive income of my own.  I want to travel slow, meet and develop relationships with a mobile community, and still have the freedom to explore other options.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm building my own line to cater to a market that I think is ignored. Remote workers, perpetual travelers, and even families seeking lifestyle alternatives.  
You can buy a unit onboard and pay a monthly maintenance fee that can be covered by rentals when not onboard, you can stay for months in a unit that is being rented out by an owner, or you can stay in one of our ship owned units for however long you‚Äôd like.  You can cook your own meals onboard, bought from the onboard grocery store.  You can work without limitations, thanks to our amazing onboard (included) internet connection, and all the while you can explore the local flavor of wherever we happen to be moored. 
We offer a worldwide itinerary with port stays lasting at least three days.  No rushed runs through the local city to see the main sites.  Actual time to explore and get to know the areas we are passing through.

Cruise,"Trying to plan a vacation this summer for my husband and myself, we‚Äôve only been on one cruise for our honeymoon last year. It was a carnival cruise and we had a great time! The two options we‚Äôre looking at for this summer are: 1) Carnival cruise to Half Moon Cay, Grand Turk, and Amber Cove. Or 2) Royal Caribbean cruise to Cura√ßao, Aruba, and CocoCay. Both are 8 day itineraries. 

What we‚Äôre really hoping to get out of the trip is some relaxation time at beautiful beaches while enjoying drinks and snorkeling in blue waters. On our cruise last year our favorite day was going to Mr. Sanchos in Cozumel, so hoping to find a recreation of that day.

First I was leaning towards option 1 for the ports, but then we saw the ship would be pretty identical to last year and thought maybe we‚Äôd like option 2 to explore a new style of cruise ship. Option 2 is getting a little more expensive though, especially when looking into all inclusive day passes or other beach options at Aruba and Cura√ßao.

Cruise,"Wanted to share small moment of reflection. 

I‚Äôm currently at home going over some cruise blogger videos and thinking about some last minute shopping that needs to happen before our family cruise on 3/24. 

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have travelled a bit, not too much on cruises, mostly flights, trains, etc. This cruise will be my 6th cruise overall, and my husband, and son‚Äôs first. 

My parents escaped a dictatorship and they came to the USA in search of freedom and a better life. I am born and raised in Miami. Capital of cruise ships, right? Funny enough as a child my family couldn‚Äôt afford vacations. We were poor working class. We did go to Disney and theme parks once. Growing up my mother dreamed of traveling the world and getting to know other places, she often befriended tourists and sailors to get to know about their homelands as she couldn‚Äôt really escape her country. Mom passed that down to me, she fostered a love of getting to know the world beyond comfort zones. 

Anywho. Getting ready for the cruise. I thought back to when I was a kid in the 90s, the beach my family usually went to in Miami was South Pointe Park beach. It has always been in my opinion the most gorgeous beach in Miami. That‚Äôs the beach that when the cruise ships sail out of the port towards the open water you see a pier and the beach to the left of the ship. As a kid, often times we‚Äôd see ships leaving out to sea. I remember running to the pier or close to the pier and waving at all the passengers looking out from the cruise ships on the decks. Most of the times they‚Äôd wave back. I remember this fondly. It was always one of my favorite things to do at that beach. As a kid I thought, some day I want to be one of those people waving back at the little girl on the beach.  

I‚Äôm happy to report that every time I have cruise out of Miami I make it a thing, almost ritual like, to head out to the deck, make sure I see south pointe beach and wave at all the people there. I have cruised out of Europe and strangely enough, I didn‚Äôt do it when I sailed out of there. 

Anyway, just wanted to share. My son is too small to understand. I‚Äôll try to get him to wave though. Definitely making my husband wave.",Random Story -kind of-,,Insurance-Limp,,0,2023-03-04 20:02:45

I‚Äôve been looking at pricing on the website &amp; realizing for the veranda rooms it was only $300 more for a double occupancy than being there by myself (didn‚Äôt want to choose a solo cabin - they all had obstructed views &amp; I do plan on spending a fair bit of time in the cabin being an autistic adult who needs generous recharge time &amp; sometimes doesn‚Äôt want to be perceived by others lol) 

I might invite a friend or maybe my mother. Its so far in advance hard to say lol. Maybe a significant other! I wouldn‚Äôt mind going alone at all but it would just be really nice to have someone to chat with at dinners and such, go on an excursion together. 

My cruise goals; spa package + a few treatments, reading books, afternoon tea, enjoying the specialty restaurants, napping on a beach, meditation &amp; unplugging. ultra limited phone useage!

I have been super privileged to eat at Daniel in NYC so I was so excited to see Le Voyage By Daniel Boulud featured on the ship. Fine dining is definitely one of my favorite hobbies when I can fit it into a trip. 

After doing research on the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù packages and thinking about my own relationship with alcohol after having been sober for 6 months, I think alcohol wise Id have 1-2 pi√±a colada at the pool deck maybe 2-3 times on the sailing and a singular glass of wine for dinner, it didn‚Äôt seem like a good deal to choose the all inclusive deal because I don‚Äôt want wi-fi &amp; cannot see myself drinking tons of alcohol each day to make it worth it.

3. Porters. These are the people you hand your luggage to to bring on the boat? And they cost $5 per piece of luggage? Again when do you hand over the cash? When you hand them the luggage? 


4. Are there any more randos on this trip that I will have to hand cash to? Can someone please elaborate where I will meet them, what is their expected tip and at which point I hand them the cash?

Cruise,"Hello!

I'm looking to book a round trip Alaska cruise from Vancouver this September. 

It will be my Dad and I (he's 60, I'm 30). It would be the first cruise ever for the both of us. I've narrowed my choices down to two ships based on a couple mandatory things for us (roundtrip out of Vancouver, and we really want to see the inside passage). Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas, and Celebrity Eclipse.

Neither of us are drinkers or partiers, and I'm not really a watersports/swimming enthusiast. Both of us do want to have good food available, and be able to get some good views of the passage and glaciers. 

Between the two ships, I'm strongly leaning towards Celebrity since it seems more laid back (energy wise). I'm giving the dress code a bit of a side eye, but it's not a deal breaker. 

We are trying to keep things a little cheaper where possible and avoid spending money unnecessarily. I was thinking that we could skip on drinks packages (neither of us drink much alcohol, so probably just cheaper to buy the 1 or 2 beverages on their own?). I don't think we would need to worry about onboard wifi either, Telus seems to think we'd still get coverage (any other Canadians have experience with this? I don't fully believe them, hahaha)

Am I missing anything huge here? I've had a bit of information overload trying to do the research for this trip, and I'm paranoid that I've glossed over something major.

Also, any tips on Canadian sites or agencies to look at booking with?

1. Book 2 x connected rooms, one adult probably still have to sleep on the sofa bed, which I heard is rock hard.
2. Book a suite with 2 bedroom.  one of the bedroom has 2 x pullman bed so two older kids could sleep on the pullman beds.  

The suite is of course more expensive, I will do it if it's the only option.  Every time I try to check price of connected rooms it tells me there are no connected room available.

Cruise,"Many years ago I went on a ship which I believe was named Doric....or something like that.  It only had about 1,000 passengers....maybe even less.  It sailed from NYC to Bermuda.  Back then the ships would dock right in downtown Hamilton.  They were so much smaller then.  On the day of sailing friends arranged a sail away party for us.  They were allowed on the ship with us as we boarded.  We went to the pool deck.  They had little covered alcoves lining the pool.  Awaiting us was a full set up of food and drinks.  The party lasted about an hour.  And then there were announcements that all those NOT sailing had to leave the ship.  Just the thought of that happening today is incredible.  I also remember metal cabin keys.  No balconies .... just a porthole to look out in your cabin.  Dinner every night required people to dress up.

Cruise,"I have been on about 13 cruises. I have booked some on large online travel sites (expedia, [cruise.com](https://cruise.com), [cruises.com](https://cruises.com) etc) and also directly with the lines. In all of those cruises, I have reached out to a travel agent at least 4 times, each a different agent/agency, because I am constantly told by the waking world, that ""it should never be more expensive to book with a TA, they don't charge you, they can get discounts that you cant"" etc. etc. blah blah. 

Meanwhile, each time I have reached out to a TA about a particular cruise I am eyeballing, I receive a quote that is FAR above what I am able to find with a cursory search online whether it be with a travel site, or directly with the line. 

This week I checked a category of room, on a specific sailing, with 2 people, factoring in the only discount that cruise line offers via their online booking (past sailor 5% off) and nothing else. Price after port fees, without insurance, with past sailor discount applied $3386. I contacted a TA , since they can work with the cruise line to apply other discounts that are combinable with promotions and additional discounts, to have them get a price for the same room, same sailing, same everything and they came back claiming to have added additional discounts to the fare, with a number closer to 3800, without insurance, after taxes and fees. 

This has been my consistent experience with TA's. I also have noticed a trend of being ghosted after politely and respectfully letting them know that a better price is offered directly from the cruise line with less discounts ""applied"". No price breakdown, no explanation, sometimes even an indignant reply and shooing me away. 

Id love to talk to one of these TA's that live up to the lore of truly getting the best price, chasing down price reduction refunds, getting additional perks, etc.",Travel agents and pricing.,,Free_Rub1709,,0,2023-03-02 13:44:56

Most cruises I found that have a decent amount of ports are 14 nights and stop at only 4-5 ports. Are there not cruises leaving from Florida and ending in Mexico (or vice versa) that hit up all the islands along the way?

1: Is there any other fees or expenses we have to pay before getting on the ship or even off the ship? We don't plan on buying anything extra on board and afraid there will be more fees after ive already paid $2300 for the cruise

2: Anything we need to bring to get on the ship? Drivers license, birth certificate, passport, etc...?

3: is covid tests still required or needed to board before embarkation?

4: anything we should pack being on a cruise ship going to cozumel? My wife and i have never been out of the country (let alone our home state)

5: any other questions i should be asking that i haven't,  or tips to share with a newbie?

Cruise,"My parents are looking at a transatlantic cruise on Symphony of the Seas in October of this year from Barcelona to Fort Lauderdale. The ship looks spectacular, but they're concerned about a ship so large. They've been on mid size ships before with Holland America, Princess and Celebrity, but nothing this big. Since this cruise has 8 days straight without any ports is it going to feel absolutely packed? We've not been on RCI either or a ship this big so can't really advise them. Having done some research I imagine that this cruise, being 14 nights total will likely have more people like them on board (retirees) than kids and that being on a big ship is a good thing when you have so many at sea days.

Cruise,"I haven't traveled solo before but it's to a port I really want to go to. Flights home could be as cheap as $350 (at least this year in that month they are that cheap even though other months are more expensive, I can't see flights that late into next year though).

Inside cabin would be $1800, an ocean balcony would be $2500. I know everyone here is always balcony-or-bust but are there people who would recommend inside here? I really only want to spend time in my cabin sleeping, I'd be happy to stay up late outside on the deck.

Trying to convince someone to go with me so it can be $1400/person for a balcony but I'm thinking it may be more fun to try it solo, in which case the inside room makes the most sense financially. This is less about the view and more about the exciting solo travel on a budget.

I'm very tempted to book. Also looking into roulette strategies so I can pay off the cruise while I'm on the cruise, so really it'd be a wash (hoping the cruiseline sees this and offers me a discount expecting me to gamble a lot then I don't üíÖ)

I'd likely book airbnbs for a few nights since the cruise ends on a weekend and Wednesday/Thursday travel seems cheapest, and this adds to the appeal- getting to stay in the country for a few extra days and explore. I guess I'm worried about lugging a giant suitcase around while hanging out in a foreign country alone for a few days, I wish I could just backpack it.

The main reason why I think I'm crazy is that I've never been on a cruise before. But I really want to. And it seems like the perfect ship to the perfect destination, and the perfect time for me to travel. I might try to book a quick cheap weekend one to get a feel for cruises between now and then but I want to get the room before prices go up.

My beloved Carnival Sunshine will be leaving Charleston, SC at the end of 2024 which is soul-crushing. I LOVE that ship because it has an amazing thermal suite with free access if you book a serenity room. 

The thermal suite has indoor ceramic heated loungers looking out over the ocean and 3 saunas. Everytime I book this ship, I hang out on a ceramic lounger, away from the noise. Being a Carnival ship, not many people take advantage of the serenity spa so I can always get a heated lounger and hang out with my son. It's a nice, cheap vacation as I drive to the port from Atlanta (my home). 

Can anyone recommend another ship/port that offers a similar experience that is close to Atlanta? I tried checking out Tampa Bay and Mobile, but it doesn't look like those Carnival ships offer the same amenities.

Cruise,"My wife and I are in our early 30s and looking for a Northern European itinerary to celebrate our 10th anniversary. It will be my 3rd cruise (but it's been a while: Princess in 2006, NCL in in 2011), and my wife's first. 

The things that are important to us are: 

* ITINERARY. We would love larger historical port cities to enjoy (Copenhagen and Stockholm are must-haves, and Helsinki/Oslo/Amsterdam/Berlin all would be ideal as well). 
* FOOD QUALITY. If we're eating dinner on the ship we want it to be fantastic and to reflect the local specialties. 
* A sense of pampering/luxury. 
* No/minimal kids. 

Not particularly important to us: 

* SOCIAL ASPECT. We mostly will want to keep to ourselves. 
* BUSTLING NIGHTLIFE. Our ideal evening is drinks alone in a nice quiet space, maybe in a hot tub, maybe on a deck. We might go to a show or two if it was offered - but this is not something we need.   


The specific trips we are looking at are: 

Viking's [Viking Homelands](https://www.vikingcruises.com/oceans/cruise-destinations/baltic/viking-homelands/index.html)  
From what I can tell this would really tick all our boxes and then some - but at 15 nights it's a little longer than ideal for us - which is probably 14 days including travel on either end. 

Oceania's [Paris to Stockholm](https://www.oceaniacruises.com/baltic-cruises/paris-to-stockholm-NAU240713/?sr=%2Fcruise-finder%23marketing_region%3Dbalticandscandinavia%26time_frame%3D2024-3%7C2024-4%7C2024-5%7C2024-6%7C2024-7%7C2024-8%7C2024-9%7C2024-10%7C2024%7C2025-4%7C2025-5%26sort%3Dfeatured%3Adesc%26page%3D1%26pageSize%3D10)

We love the look of this one and are strongly leaning in this direction. Our only hesitation is that their target market is quite a bit older than we are - so when I read ""best food"" does that mean it's an octogenarian's idea of ""best food"" - or will we like it too? Will dinner be too early? Will cocktail bars close too early? etc. 

Azamara's [Northern Cities](https://www.azamara.com/voyage/pr12u366/12-night-northern-cities-voyage)

This is a pretty nice looking trip as well. I just haven't seen or heard as much about Azamara and am not sure how to think about them relative to others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there other lines/itineraries we should be considering? I've heard good things about Seabourn and Virgin Voyages but was unimpressed by their itineraries in this region. Should we go with our first instinct and book Oceania or are we too young?

She was told this is a huge deal, and they would be charged $200 a person to remedy it. Said agent stated ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing this job for 20 years, I know I asked you for your middle names‚Äù but‚Äî if she had asked why would my sister have not given them? She obviously knows the middle names of her immediate family. Also‚Äî NONE of the rest of us have our middle names on our documents for NCL (Which makes it glaringly obvious that she didn‚Äôt ask/specify because how are there 19 of the rest of us who also don‚Äôt have them listed) *side note:* we are using their flight package and shuttle service, which I am seeing can also be a headache

Question being, is this as huge of a deal and she‚Äôs making it, or are they just looking for money? If it‚Äôs only because of our flight package‚Äî TSA doesn‚Äôt care about middle names when flying domestically.

Cruise,"We just got off our first Virgin cruise yesterday, and I wanted to give my review for anyone else who‚Äôs on the fence like I was. We did a 6 night cruise to Costa Maya, Roatan, and Bimini. For this review I‚Äôll focus on the food. I‚Äôll post another about the cruise itself later.

First off let me start with a disclaimer and warning. We stayed in Miami the night of the trip and used points to book a room so we decided to splurge for dinner. We went to a restaurant that had live king crab and cooked it fresh, we also got a Kobe filet to share. This was the most expensive meal of my life but by far the best. The downside of this was going from this level of food to cruise food was a major downgrade. Nothing Virgin offered or really any major cruise offered could have come close to that meal. So my recommendation is do not go to an amazingÔøº restaurant before you start your cruise you will let down by everything on board. With that said I will start my breaking down the dining from best to worst. Forgive me if I don‚Äôt get the name of all the places right. 

The galley: it‚Äôs not a buffet thank God. They have some quick bites you can get a plate of quickly but everything else is ordered off of a menu and brought to you buy a server. The deserts and pastries were amazing, the tacos and ramen were also incredible as well as the fries from the burger place. Breakfast there was really good as well. Overall the food here was really good, I would have loved an Indian option, but it was good. The sushi was okay, not great. 

The pizza place: the pizza was really good and made to order so it always came out piping hot and fresh. I wish they had more topping options.

Extra Virgin: this is the Italian place and it was delicious, I highly recommend going. 

Wake: this is the steakhouse and it was okay, steak wasn‚Äôt bad, about the same and chops on royal but you can get a far better steak on land. 

Korean BBQ: this place was decent food wasn‚Äôt bad but the atmosphere was fun and I recommend going for that reason. 

Pink agave: this was this Mexican place, it wasn‚Äôt bad but wasn‚Äôt great, you could skip it and be fine. 

Razzle dazzle: wasn‚Äôt very good. Fried chicken was good but that was bout it. 

Test kitchen: horrible, the menu changes every night but I didn‚Äôt meet one person that actually liked it. Skip. Wonderland on royal blows this out of the water and shows how this concept should be done right. 

Room service: it was okay, but very limited options food wise.  

Overall the food on Virgin was good and we liked the concept of breaking up the crowd to several different food venues across the ship, it really makes for a better cruise experience. One thing we did not like as a couple was the small table sizes and being seated right on top of other people. I know it‚Äôs a ship but we did not like feeling crammed into to small tables right beside other people like sardines each night. Royal did a much better job of this. With that said we did like most of the food on Virgin, but I would recommend just sticking to the regular dining most nights and spend more time enjoying your trip than spending 1.5 hours in a mediocre speciality dining venue when you could have gotten something just as tasty in the galley. Just book the best places and skip the rest and enjoy your trip.",Review of my recent Virgin cruise Food version,,allvoltrey,,0,2023-02-26 22:56:49

My impression is that this industry is so predatory and outdated. The whole system of booking, gives major boomer vibes. The way the websites are set up are not transparent on its prices.

Cruise,"So my family and I recently cruised with Royal Caribbean out of Galveston, TX on the *Allure of the Seas* on a 8 day cruise with ports in Honduras and Mexico. 

We had an absolute blast. We would really like to plan another cruise, but with our only experience being with RC, I was curious as to how RC stacks up to other cruise lines. I figured the best way to do this is to give my initial thoughts on different things and hopefully people can give me some opinions and experiences against my own for comparison.

The boarding process at the cruise terminal was really my only gripe about the entire experience. We sailed out of Galveston, and it was a bit nightmarish of a process as first time cruisers. Maybe this will get easier as we become more experienced, but the terminal was crowded, with no real organization. We had no idea how to check in (we found out later we could do this via the app pre-boarding) and were bounced around lines before finally being helped at a randomly placed desk in the middle of the room.

Once onboard, our safety check-in was a breeze and we were almost immediately able to check into our room. 

The room, considering my expectations, was decently spacious. We had an ocean view stateroom on the third deck. It was quiet, and there was never a night where we had issues with noise. Staff were exceptional and went above and beyond to take care of us during our stay. If we would go out, we would almost always come back to folded clothes, clean towels (and towel animals!) and room. 

We mostly dined at the Windjammer, with the exception of a lunch or two at Wipe Out and Sorrentos. I found the food to be of exceptional quality, and while breakfast and lunch were fairly similar menus day-to-day, it was all delicious. Dinner themes would change, but again, all delicious. We did do main dining one night, and it blew us away. All the free food options we had on the ship were fantastic and I felt this was one of the highlights of the cruise.

The other highlight of the cruise for us was the entertainment. We didn‚Äôt do the Casino, however we did get to see almost every show or act they had onboard sans a few of the late night comedy shows. The Amber Theater was mind blowing and the production was all top of the line. Mamma Mia, while not on par with Broadway, was definitely a high level, high quality production. My wife loved the comedy shows and even I found myself laughing not being the biggest fan of standup. The Aquatheater was a huge surprise. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect, but it was on par with most shows you could see in Vegas. The high-tech stage was cool and again, production was top-notch. Studio B had an ice rink, and while we didn‚Äôt get to ice skate, we did see the ice show which again, did not disappoint.

The only area I felt was lacking a bit was in the kid department. Now, admittedly our daughter is shy and she did really like the whirlpool, but she didn‚Äôt really get much from the Adventure Ocean program. She‚Äôs 9, so she‚Äôs at a weird age where they‚Äôre not quite independent yet, and she was one of the younger kids being in the 9-11 age group. They had a really cool looking science lab my daughter was excited about, but the science activities are only done IF there is enough interest from the group and so she never had the opportunity to use it. The Allure didn‚Äôt have any of the slides or some of the other features I‚Äôve seen on other RC ships, so I‚Äôd be curious as to how they stack up to even some of the other ships in the RC fleet. 

Anyways, anyone with experience with other ships in the RC fleet, or other cruise lines entirely (Norwegian, Carnival, MSC, Disney, etc), how does RC and the Allure stack up in terms of cruise experiences versus cost? TIA!",2nd Cruise Advice,,Talkamania,,0,2023-02-25 22:04:00

Cruise,"Hi all! Thank you so much for helping me decide my Alaska cruise provider! I'm booked and ready to go on the Sapphire Princess April 29th. I'm so excited!

I'm a big over planner and early retired a year into covid so I've had the time and inclination to watch the YouTube videos, read the articles, and track the ship's itinerary between now and then. My intention is to plan it and forget it until it's time to do my 45, 30, and 15-day tasks. And then rejig everything when the onboard details are posted or I get my first Patter and just go with it.

And now I have questions Google can't or won't answer. Sapphire is doing a repositioning cruise April 6-12 and then has nothing scheduled until April 29. According to an old cruise critic (I think) post, she was scheduled for drydock in Portland April 12-May 1, but obviously that has changed. She also seems to have not been actively sailing until September '22 for various reasons.

The questions...
... if she is in drydock, what would they possibly want to do since she's only been active again for 9ish months? Is this normal because she needs to run a different fuel system in Alaska?
... if she's not debarking passengers on April 29, does that mean I can access my stateroom upon boarding instead of waiting? Can I assume nobody but my cabin attendant has been in the stateroom for weeks and therefore not sanitize every surface and air out the room when I arrive? I probably will anyway as I'm a low-level germaphobe so taking a cruise at all wasn't even on my radar until I New Years Resolved myself into pushing my limits in 2023. So yeah, never cruised, never traveled alone, and now this. Limits? What limits? Lol
... she's doing what seems to be an odd, or non-typical route north with ocean sailing for two days up to hubbard glacier that no other itineraries seem to do and the spa isn't booking anything for those 2 days. Is she blowing out the cobwebs? Or testing the different fuel system she needs for Alaska waters? Or other? It almost seems as though she is doing the typical inside passage route in reverse.

Thanks all!! Yes, I know I'm overthinking. 

TL;DR
Sapphire Princess appears to have no cruises scheduled for 18 days prior to my sailing and is spending her first two days at sea traveling north to Hubbard Glacier.

***

My logic - 

If we upgraded to free at sea plus ($343 each), we would get 

premium plus beverages (only useful for me)

$200 extra excursion credit

unlimited wifi for both of us (I absolutely need to have unlimited so I can call my kids as much as I want/they want, she is less concerned about having it, but it would be nice) ($110pp not in the package)

2 extra specialty dining (this would be nice, though my sister is a vegetarian so that limits things, plus we will be in the Haven so we already can eat there

***

So for the free at sea plus it would be $686, but if we subtract the $200 excursion credit, and the $110 I'd be paying for unlimited internet, we would basically be paying $376 for

premium plus drinks for me
unlimited wifi for her (which would be nice, but not necessary)

Cruise,"Hello everyone! Apologies if this is something that gets asked a lot. My wife and are taking our first cruise (I have been on before but it was over 10 years with my parents as a teenager) this summer in June, a 5-night cruise from Charleston to the Bahamas. Based on some posts I‚Äôve seen here it looks like Half Moon Cay is a good place just to sit around on the beach and relax. But for the first stop in Nassau, I am wondering if it‚Äôs worth finding some things to do. 

We had looked at some excursions through carnival, but they all seem kind of‚Ä¶ eh. Everything seems crowded, rushed, and not really worth doing. For example like ‚Äòswimming with the sea turtles‚Äô but the reviews make it seem like you ride over, look at them, and then you‚Äôre done. 

We had looked at renting the private cabanas over in pearl island. It‚Äôs all booked through carnival but I did find availability on a site called Viator. The reviews seem good and it looks legit, but has anyone ever used them before? 

And as a broader question, my wife is really worried if we book anything outside of carnival we might not make it back to the ship in time. Anyone had issues with this using 3rd parties? 

I guess really what I want to know is 1. Are shore excursions worth it 2. If so, is it okay to use a 3rd party or should we stick with carnival?

Cruise,"Husband and I went on a Celebrity cruise last year and it was wonderful. We sailed on the Apex and went with a Sky Suite in the Retreat. We are in our late 20s, no kids and it was our first experience cruising. We loved the ship, the restaurants, the Retreat sundeck and the service was excellent.

 We're not big partiers and kind of enjoyed the quietness of the experience. For context we were docked near a Carnival cruise one day at port that was blasting music all day and I was glad that I was not on that ship. I instead much preferred the shows and performances every evening and doing excursions during the day. 

Anyway, this year we would also like to go on a cruise and we were considering NCL (the Haven). Looking at the reviews of the ships, I think I prefer Celebrity, but I would like to consider trying something different.

After comparing all options, I found a really good deal on RCL Australia and booked it straight away, paid the amount specified in full. 

Shortly after looking at the confirmation page, I realized that I put a wrong month for my sons bday and called the support line straight away to fix it. While chatting with the support specialist, among all she asked whether I‚Äôd like to pay an outstanding balance of slightly more than a hundred dollars. She also said that if I don‚Äôt pay my booking will be automatically canceled and I‚Äôd receive a refund according to their refund policy which at a time would already be less than full amount. So I challenged that for a bit trying to understand where the amount came from but she had no clue saying that in her system the booking was created at that amount and she can not wave it or give on board credit, so it was either pay or loose more money and the booking itself. 

I paid as it wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal but wtf? I still can‚Äôt get them to answer where the outstanding balance came from, and what bothers me the most is that my booking would‚Äôve been cancelled without me even knowing it if I wouldn‚Äôt have called. Their email support been next to useless.

We plan to be off the boat as soon as possible and and not returned until an hour ish before departure.

We're Canadian so we're looking at 7-night itineraries with Vancouver departure/return. Parents are late 70s/early 80s so this is a bucket list item for them. None of us have ever been on a cruise before. 

Right now, we're looking at Royal Caribbean's 7-night multi-glacier experience itinerary on the Brilliance of the Seas. It includes Sitka, Tracy Arm Fjord, Juneau, Hubbard Glacier, and Ketchikan. One of my parents is very active, but the other has mobility issues and is not keen on going on many shore excursions. We thought this itinerary might be good since it seems there will be plenty of time on the ship, and we have no idea how wheelchair accessible places like Sitka, Juneau or Ketchikan are. We are planning on booking an accessible balcony room for our parents so that they can enjoy the view even if one of them declines to go onshore. 

I've read through a bunch of posts in this subreddit that Glacier Bay is a must-see, but I've checked another cruise line and it seems that there's limited availability during the time we'd like to go. I've also been told that Royal Caribbean is more family-friendly than some other cruise lines. 

I'm just hoping to get some advice for planning a great multi-generational family cruise to Alaska, especially when one of the older family members has mobility issues.

**Who:** Me (20sF),  DH (30s), DS (14mo), DD (2.5yr, turned 3yr during the trip), my parents/kids Gma &amp; Gpa (50s).


**What:** 9 day cruise with Norwegian (NCL), + 1 day in Panam√° before and after, so 11 days total.


**When:** Feb 2023


**Where:** Colon Panam√°  / Cartagena, Columbia / Cura√ßao / Aruba / Bonaire / Limon, Costa Rica / Panam√° Canal 


**Food/Meals:** We ate most of our meals in the Garden Cafe / free buffet area. It was easiest with the kids.  We also ate in OSheehans (pub food) a few times because it was less busy.

Gma and Gpa graciously took DD and DS one night so we could eat at Cagneys Steakhouse. It was on par with other big city steakhouses. A wonderful meal. 

DD(F, 2-3yr) was often bored at meals and would get into mischief (dumping piles of salt, playing with the window shades and sugar packets, couldn‚Äôt sit still, etc). We used the iPad at a few meals and that helped. She was honestly pretty well behaved, all things considered. 

DS(M, 14mo) was a rascal at meals. Food could never come fast enough, or if it came too early he was done before us and then bored. He could not be entertained via iPad. He was‚Ä¶ a 1yr old lol. He behaved as one would expect, which unfortunately wasn‚Äôt super enjoyable lol. 


**Sleep/Naps:** We had a small ocean view room, 8th level, aft/back of ship.  


Our bed was 2 twins pushed together, very comfortable.  DD (F, 2-3yr) was on a bunk bed which folded down from the wall. She thought that was soooo cool.  DS (M, 14mos) was below her on a floor bed.


The floor bed arrangement was new for us (we use a standard crib at home). Luckily he was so tired every day, he would fall asleep snuggling one of us, and we‚Äôd transfer him to the floor bed. The first night we had a few ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused‚Äù wake ups, but the rest of the trip was basically flawless. 


Curtains close and sorta lapse over the other, so it got nice and dark! We also brought a portable sound machine, which was REALLY nice for all of us. We never were bothered by people walking the halls near O‚ÄôSheehans (the 24/7 pub). 


Naps happened mostly on the go in the stroller,  or on my lap during a few excursions which involved bus/train/boat.  During the 2 At Sea days, DH stayed in the room with DS during nap time, while I took DD to the pool.


**Getting around / What to bring and buy:**

*These are only my opinions.*


‚ÄîMaybe skip: We brought the baby carrier and never used it except through the airport‚Ä¶ 


‚ÄîDef bring:  We also brought a small, collapsible side by side double stroller (on Amazon - Delta Childrens LX or something.. $100ish).  This was mostly fantastic‚Ä¶ Lots of pockets, easy fold, navigates well for excursions, etc‚Ä¶ 

but 3 complaints:  

1- even being a slim side by side, it was too wide for the skinny cruise ship hall ways if another person were in the hall, or a vacuum or something‚Ä¶ 

2- I wish it had a larger umbrella‚Ä¶ 

3- I wish it leaned back more.    


If you only have 1 little, I saw someone with a GREAT Safety1st brand stroller, and they tend to be a budget friendly brand so I looked it up: *Safety 1st Step Lite Compact Stroller. Great umbrella and great recline. $99*


‚ÄîDef bring:  Brita water filtering water bottle:  I left mine at home in favor of my larger, more durable Stanley flip straw bottle‚Ä¶ but so wish I‚Äôd brought it. The water where we were is safe to drink, but it did taste a little off‚Ä¶ as is always the case when we leave home lol. 


‚ÄîSkip it: Leave the power strip at home. On the Norwegian Jewel, our oceanview room had 3 regular outlets, and 4 USB outlets. Skip the power strip. This was plenty for iPads and iPhones. 


‚ÄîSkip it:  Lanyards. My stepmom said we‚Äôd need lanyards for our keycards which you need for drinks, some meals, and room access. I always stuck mine in my pocket, fannypack, or my husbands wallet. 


‚ÄîBring:  5s and 1s for tips for your excursion/tour guides, and baggage handling folks, as well as on shore snacks, souvenirs, etc. 


‚ÄîBring:  Phone or iPad with DOWNLOADED content. Wifi wasn‚Äôt great on the ship for us, and pricey. 


‚ÄîBring:  Suckers/lollipops on the flight. It will help with their ears during landing. We couldn‚Äôt find them at the airport, so do buy ahead of time. 



**Misc notes:**

‚ÄîBabies in the pool. Rules say ‚Äúno diapers/swim diapers in the pool. No babies in the pool. ‚Äú Let me tell you‚Ä¶ there were hella babies in the pool in diapers and swim diapers. So. Do you. 


‚ÄîOur ship (Norwegian Jewel) had an area behind the pool bar/ping pong tables for tots age 6mo-3yr with toys that were sanitized and rotated daily. It was a freakin lifesaver. Our kids loved playing in there. Parents stay. It‚Äôs not a drop off area.  There was no window though, so that was a small bummer. 


‚ÄîStaff loooooved our baby/young toddler.  They were so kind. They didn‚Äôt interact with our older toddler as much, which sorta broke my heart bc you could tell she was sad like ‚ÄúHey what about me?‚Äù when they‚Äôd play Peek A Boo with the baby. It‚Äôs fine, just a thing we noticed. 


‚ÄîWe always made a point to clean up the floor after meals out of respect for the next guest. The staff would always always stop us and say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on vacation, we do this.‚Äù  They always offered to help carry our buffet food back to a table for us, or get us a highchair, etc. They were very very accommodating. 


‚ÄîWe had a coupon on our door for $29 bag of laundry midway through the cruise. 10/10 experience. It was worth every penny. We had our airport outfits (winter clothing) washed, fresh undies for DD (who occasionally drips on her way to the potty), and fresh outfits for DS who is a very messy eater. 


**Would we do it again?:**

‚ÄîI **WOULD/WILL** cruise with Norwegian again. It was a lovely experience. We already purchased deposits for our next cruise with them!! I think we will do Alaska, but we will see.


‚ÄîI **would NOT** recommend cruising/vacationing at length with a 14mo old lol. DD really enjoyed herself at age 2.5-3yr. DS at 14mo was just mad he couldn‚Äôt run where ever he wanted at all times. He just wanted to play and run.

Cruise,"I found out today that Princess no longer offers a soda package.  The information is still on their website but if you go to the cruise personalizer the only non-alchoholic package is the Stateroom Canned Soda Package.  With this package they deliver a 6 pack of soda to your stateroom.  You can mix and match sodas but still it is pretty lame that you can't purchase a package just get a soda where you are at on the ship.  You are still allowed to carry on a 12 pack of soda per person so unless you are going to drink a serious amount of soda during your cruise I have no idea why you would pay for this package.  On my cruise there is only this odd 6 pack of soda package, a bottled water package and then 2 alcohol packages that start at $75 a day.

We make sure to stay in the same cabin for both ""legs"" of our back to back cruise (not just for this trick but that way we can unpack and not stress outside of having to disembark momentarily for customs)

The day before the first cruise ends, we go and buy duty free alcohol on the ship. This is the only day cruisers can take it back to the room, as it technically the last day of the current cruise. Because we are staying on, we now have a reasonably inexpensive bottle of liquor or 2  for early mornings or late nights where we don't want to have to run to a bar.

The price is very low and we love that. We have to consider budget before anything and MSC is checking all of the boxes for a 7 days cruise that Royal is not. We are not super picky on ports. This cruise is more for the kids and to relax on the ship, as long as the ports have beaches we are fine with that. Meraviglia has a ton of kid friendly activities that are really drawing me in and we could leave out of New York. We live in Pennsylvania and a drivable port is a huge plus for the budget.

They are actually flying in and out of Stockholm from the US because they have friends in Sweden they are visiting for a few days ahead of the cruise.

The cruise is scheduled to arrive back in Athens at the end of the trip at 6am on the last day. They need to fly to Stockholm sometime that day (from Athens) to catch their flight back to the US the following day. I'm working on booking the Stockholm to Athens round trip flights now. I've never been on a cruise and neither has my daughter, so how much time should we allow the morning the cruise disembarks (allegedly around 6am) to get to the airport without being frantic and worrying about missing flights?

Cruise,"My two cents on this cruise for anyone looking to cruise NCL or the Breakaway in the near future.

This is my 3rd cruise on NCL, solo female, early 40's

Positives:

* Embarkation had a long line, but it went quickly and I walked right on the ship afterwards. Probably 1 hour total.
* Main dining room food was really good, more variety than previous cruise. Plenty of staff on floor and very friendly.
* Le Bistro - great food, friendly staff. Went twice.
* Main shows: Six and Burn the Floor. Top talent. I'm not a fan of musicals, but it was good for what it was.
* Shore Excursions - booked 4 with NCL because of the $50 credit. Three were well organized, and all of them had professional and friendly guides.
* Overall, all staff I dealt with were super friendly and happy to help if needed.
* Water slides were fun and not busy.
* The waterfront area (Deck 8) is nice both day and night, with not too many people and fairly quiet, comfortable seating for reading or just relaxing.
* O'Sheehan's was good. Food was great and although there was a wait every time, it wasn't as long as they anticipated. Most I had to wait was 15 minutes.
* All food venues had buzzers you could get for waiting for a seat to open. Thought this was great. I could grab a drink in the meantime and be seated soon after.
* Shakers bar staff were great and quicker than most other bars.
* I loved Harvest Caye (private island), mostly because of the pool. I didn't eat or drink anything and just went back on the ship for an hour for lunch. Seemed like lot's of people were drinking though and the food looked good.
* I enjoyed the excursions at the other cruise ports (Costa Maya, Cozumel and Roatan) but didn't like the Costa Maya port (way too crowded and hard to navigate) and would probably avoid on a future cruise.

Negatives:

* Disembarkation was a bit hectic and long
* Can't comment on the food in the buffet, I only ate there once and it was a salad. The crowds were huge all the time and I wanted to avoid it.
* La Cucina (specialty dining) had poor service and food. I think one person was still in training. They were friendly, but seemed overwhelmed and were not attentive (as in would need to be called over for everything and wait times were long). Food was okay but nothing special. What I disliked the most was that a lot of food was wasted. Food portions were very big and they wouldn't allow take away. I saw a few tables leave with over half the meals uneaten.
* Bar service was lacking, mostly because there were very few bar staff at all the bars. They also seemed less than friendly/happy, but I don't blame them.
* I normally only get my room cleaned every second day and would normally only get the service done once a day, so the reduced service didn't bother me. However, they wouldn't have it done until 4pm, so most days I didn't bother.
* Pool area and deck was super busy, but I usually avoid this part of the ship anyway.
* Solo meeting was pretty much non-existent. It was held in Spice H20, so there was no dedicated space or bar. Most people didn't show up after the first day, and therefore limited dinners together and getting to know other solos.
* The excursions booked at Harvest Caye were very disorganized at the Marina. But once on the boat, staff were great.
* Activities on the ship weren't that interesting, and the few that were of interested were crowded. The Atrium (where a lot were held) was packed all the time.

Overall it was a good cruise. I preferred the previous ones (on Epic). The downfalls of this one were the crowds for everything (ship was completely booked) and lack of staff to deal with everyone. I likely won't cruise on NCL again anytime in the near future and will likely try out another cruise line. Also will likely try a smaller ship.",NCL Breakaway Feb 5 Trip Review,,confusedin2020,,0,2023-02-19 17:51:13

I've read a lot of people saying to do Disney if it's your first time (and is very nice, albeit overpriced), and will be great for the younger kids but not sure if there will be enough to do for the older ones.. and not sure if Disney warrants the premium (half our group loves Disney though, and visit 1-2x a year).   But, we keep reading/hearing how great Disney cruises are. 

We've also heard Royal Caribbean is great for families, but are concerned with how large the ship is and whether there will be enough for the younger crowd.   But you get so much more for your money, space-wise at least!  Lots of people say to combine and get best of both worlds by doing RC cruise, then a few days at the Disney parks so that's a consideration. 

TL:DR Guess my question is, Disney Wish or RC Allure of the Sea for first-timer family cruise?

Cruise,"Hello!  I thought I'd come to some experts here on reddit before shelling out money for a travel agent who might find some of my questions stupid.  I've never been on a cruise before but have always wanted to.  Now my friends and I are going to have schedules that line up to have a holiday at the same time.  I'm just....not sure where to book or what to do since I don't have any experience.

Our busiest friend has the days off of August 4th 2023 through August 13th 2023 and we can all plan around that.  Also all of us would like somewhere in the Carribean/Mexico/Bahamas area of the world when it comes to destinations.  4/5 days is the perfect length for us.

We're a little bit frugal so we can't go on any of the higher end cruise lines but we don't need a super budget cruise either.  Preferably we can just wait until one of the cruise lines is having a big sale and book then.  We don't mind an interior room but an ocean view would be nice since three of us have never cruised before and one of us has only done Disney with family.

As far as experiences go, some of us really want some fun things to do aboard the ship like entertainment and maybe some classes to take, a good pool etc.  Some of us really want some fun excursions to do when we're at port.  So a mix of those two is good.  We're all in our mid twenties to early thirties and want to let loose but we're also not big partiers.  (Karaoke is a must though)

So yeah any tips you might have for which cruise lines you think would be the best to look at or tips for getting a good deal on a cruise would be appreciated.",Cruise Advice - This Would Be My First Cruise,,aceavengers,,0,2023-02-18 15:44:31

Cruise,"Hi,

I'm heading off on my first cruise and trying to work out the various packages.  My wife and I are not big alcohol drinkers or consumers of cold soft drinks.

**Alcoholic drink **

Can any one tell me the cost of basic beer and spirits (liquor) on a Celebrity cruise ship? For example, Smirnoff Vodka, Heineken or similar.

I am  not a big drinker but may have a drink a night and possibly one 'blowout' if I meet some interesting people.   I'm also considering buying local wine to bring aboard - I understand that there is corkage fees.


**Non-alcoholic drinks**  
What is the  cost of espresso or specialty tea from an onboard Cafe?

Also, what is the quality of tea and coffee with meals?  Is it possible to make tea on board or is it all purchased from cafes?

**Water**

I take it that I can get free water on board - is this from the bathroom in the accommodation or do I have to buy water on bottles or are their cold water dispensers?  I'm uncertain how this works.

Surprisingly, I'm not a tight-ass but if I but a package I'll probably drink a lot more and regret it.","drinks, including hot drinks, on celebrity infinity",,willy_quixote,,0,2023-02-18 09:04:25

I‚Äôm looking to surprise my mom with an Alaskan Cruise booked for 2024. My mom is turning 70 this year and recently our family has been through a lot. My dad left my mom after nearly 40 years of marriage recently and we are still in shock. My mom is amazing and I want to give her a great gift to look forward too. She loves nature, hiking, and bird watching and has never been to Alaska so I thought this would be perfect. A few other family members will also be joining us as part of the surprise.

I‚Äôve done a lot of research already and am looking at an early August 2024 trip on the HAL Eurodam. So here are the questions I have so far:

1. If we‚Äôre sailing through Glacier Bay, is Mendenhall Glacier worth it? I know it‚Äôs a big attraction in Juneau, but I‚Äôm looking at booking an excursion to see a sled dog camp, since we love dogs too. I‚Äôm thinking about combining that with the tram ride later in the day. 

2. Are there any must-haves to make sure we pack for the climate that I don‚Äôt want to forget? I know we should be prepared for cold rain and should have bug spray.

3. To surprise my mom with this trip on her birthday, I want to wrap up some things she can use on the trip like new binoculars, a reusable water bottle, maybe some books about Alaska since she loves to read.

2.  St. Thomas- 8-6 pm (4 ships on dock) We booked for an excursion to go directly to St. John‚Äôs to basically hang out at trunk bay beach. Then if we have time probably hit up Magen bay. 


3. Tortol- 7-5 pm(2ships in dock) . We really want to see the baths at gorda but they are all sold out and to top it off they won‚Äôt allow my toddler . So we figured to just take speedys ferry to virgin gorda and just hang out at spring bay next to the baths.  The Problem is the return trip schedule for speedys is 1130 and 330pm to Tortola .

Carnival‚Äôs website wasn‚Äôt super clear on this (at least not to me), so we need to get passports before the cruise? Also, is it better to book excursions and on-board activities in advance? How early? Do spots fill up so fast that if we wait too long we won‚Äôt have anything to do?

I paid for vacation protection, but I did not pre-pay gratuities. Am I able to adjust the gratuities as we go throughout the cruise? Also, I find the bubbles and cheers packages to be extremely overpriced. Is it worth just buying drinks, water, etc. as needed/wanted?

The deets: we have two children, 3 and 5, and our favorite line is by far Celebrity (pre-kids haha). We‚Äôve also done a Disney cruise and one on Holland and liked them. We enjoy good drinks and food, and taking it slow. We do like entertainment and excursions, but due to the age of the kids, we‚Äôre not there for crazy late night bar hopping or casinos.

We will be stationed in Israel, and would like to take advantage of the cruise point in Haifa. That being said, here are the options - we will be getting a balcony cabin in either scenario.

5 Night Greek Isle cruise on Rhapsody of the Seas for ~$3600.
Or 
7 Night Greek cruise on MSC Musica for ~$3400.
The MSC price includes more (drinks and other upgrades). 

To us, since both ships are different than what we are used to (Rhapsody is much older and smaller than other RCL ships, MSC is more geared to European audience from what I gather), we will need to adjust our expectations no matter what.

Cruise,"I had the pleasure of going on both vessels fairly recently (Mardi Gras in January 2022 and Wonder I have just returned from today). These are just my opinions but I figured I'd share in case there are others who are comparing the two. Others feel free to chime in as well if you have any thoughts! I'm interested to hear. :)

For some context my husband and I are 32 and 33 respectively, I would say that the most important things for us when cruising are the food, entertainment, and excursions. We also both enjoy fitness and comedy, and admittedly we aren't really big partiers and we don't care much for Broadway-style shows or theater. So that will probably inform a lot of our opinions, just to give some forewarning.

&amp;#x200B;

**Food:** Okay, let's start with the most important thing to me when vacationing. I have to go Carnival MG for this one, by a longshot. I was going into RC with high expectations too, as my parents-in-law really hyped up RC like it had much better food but I have to say I enjoy almost every area of MG's dining over Wonder of the Seas. 

* **MDR:** We agreed this one area was equally hit and miss, but I still think MG had far more things I loved and remembered than Wonder. For Wonder, I think their best offering by far was the crab cake offered on day 1. We had the opportunity to try the ""new menus"" that some people seem to dread, but not having any previous experience with RC I felt the menus were varied and interesting. The food was just sub par, it felt low quality and bland. Appetizers and desserts usually had a better shot of being good with the entrees usually being pretty forgettable unfortunately. That said, there are some dishes I just REMEMBER and crave on MG like the strawberry bisque, salmon cake, and of course the chocolate melting cake. Even their tuna and salmon salad on sea days or breakfasts were more creative and flavorful than what I feel Wonder had to offer. 
* **Specialty Dining:** 
   * On MG we went to **Farenheit 555 Steakhouse** and **Bonsai Teppanyaki**. I REALLY enjoyed my meal at Farenheit, I had a wonderful tuna tartar for my appetizer and the chocolate sphere for dessert. They also had a lovely watermelon martini that I went back to the bar for later in my trip. For my entree, I'm actually not that big a steak fan so I went with the sea bass and I remember it being good but not like blow my socks off amazing, but overall the meal was wonderful and service was spectacular. Bonsai was also pretty good, I remember particularly liking the small plates they served as appetizers, and the salmon and garlic fried rice were good (and also way too much food for me personally). I did think the service itself was kind of cheesy/forced with the singing and party tricks, but I feel like that's a common American teppanyaki thing and the rest of our party seemed to be having a good time so I figure we might be the minority there.
   * For Wonder we did the 3 night specialty dining package and elected to go for **Wonderland, the Mason Jar, and Izumi sushi**. I'll start with what I was surprised to enjoy the most, which was Mason Jar. Their crab beignets and watermelon salad were delicious and the fried oreos were also really good, if not filling. One of those things I'd never had the opportunity to try before since I don't live near any fairs! I got a blackberry moonshine cocktail and I think they may have shorted me on the alcohol, neither of us said anything but they ended up not charging me for the drink and it didn't taste strong at all so I just assume that's what happened. As for Izumi, I thought it was worthwhile for sure. It lacked a little bit of flavor but overall I enjoyed everything I got. I thought 2 large plates was going to be too much food for me so I asked if I could get 2 small plates + 1 large instead and got the gyoza, cripsy rice with spicy tuna, and sashimi. The sashimi was fresh and tasted good (most important part) and while I thought the gyoza and spicy tuna could have been more punchy, I finished both plates. I also thought my husband's karaage was good, although it could have used a little more salt or time in a marinade but it was juicy and tasty. What ended up being my least favorite, Wonderland, breaks my heart because I was really excited for this one! I love creative menus and will try anything once, so I was excited for our culinary adventure, and while some things were good...many were just plain bad. Like inedible bad. Too many things were made out of gelatin and fondant and just had absolutely no redeeming flavor to make up for the unappealing texture. I also felt that the service felt the most forced and uncomfortable here, as they used very flowery language and tried to ""perform"" a bit but it just didn't really land for me. Again, that's not really my style so maybe some people find it enjoyable, but I thought it was kind of cringey unfortunately. I also was really disappointed in the cocktails here. They make it seem like the drinks are going to have some showmanship but the ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" cocktail just has a little piece of red or blue gelatin in the bottom and the White Rabbit Rita did not have anything special going on other than it was blue (blue curacao)? I think it was supposed to have salt foam but I didn't get any.
* **Complimentary Dining:** MG wins by a landslide in this department. Guy's burgers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Johnny Rockets (and JR costs $, which is a crime against humanity as far as I'm concerned), Pizzeria del Capitano &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorrento's, MG has really great paninis, it has the dim sum/skewers/french fry snack stop...I gained weight on MG because of how much delicious food was accessible at all times. And the ICE CREAM. Why do they have attendants at Sprinkes (RC)? Is that something that's happening on MG now too, because I do not need my ice cream intake supervised. And they only have vanilla and chocolate, where is the strawberry I ask?! And only being available in 1 spot means the number of times I walk by and think ""why not?"" is significantly less. I can't speak lower of how bad I thought the quality of the complimentary food options at RC were. I think the best thing was literally the hot dog stand on Boardwalk, which isn't saying much because I only felt the need to go there once. I CRAVED the pizza on MG, it was so fresh and delicious and they had my favorite pizza topping, chili oil\~ Guy's burgers is fire even when comparing to some of my favorite land options for burgers. It's NO CONTEST.
* **Bar:** I guess I'll add this here as well, I have a bone to pick with RC about their drink prices. They were $16.50 including the added gratuity, which to me felt really pricey. I am usually a 2-3 drinks a day on vacation type of girl, and my husband doesn't really drink at all, he might have 2-3 over the entire cruise. So the drink package are out, they just don't make sense for that amount of drinking. That said, I feel like drinks on Carnival are like $2-4 less and I feel like that makes me much more likely to buy them. Also, I thought the drinks on RC were typically weak. I asked how much it would be for a double and was told it would be $30...which...I am confused about and maybe there was a language barrier because usually it would be like $5. I think on Carnival it is $4. Also just the creativity of the drinks, I feel, was better at Carnival. Between the Alchemy bar and the Fortune Teller bar I feel like I got some very creative drinks with way more showmanship as well. I also like that they do pitchers in the comedy club as when we are with family it can be fun to just get a pitcher for everyone to share.

**Shows/Entertainment:**

I have mixed opinions on this one. When it comes to Broadway-style shows, I must admit, RC blows Carnival out of the water. We saw Intense and it was pretty awesome actually, the gymnasts were incredibly talented and me and my husband both agreed the music direction was pretty cool. I feel like the producer of Intense must have been a fan of Interstellar, which I can totally relate to. &lt;3 That said, as I mentioned before, the Broadway shows aren't make or break for me. I wouldn't be sad if I didn't see any at all on my whole cruise, so while the show was incredible it isn't a major selling point for me. What is typically more important to me is the comedy shows, and I feel like MG beats Wonder hand over fist here. For one, they had far more comedians. I think it was 5 vs the 2 we had on Wonder, and I would say on average they were way funnier. I also thought the variety shows were way more enjoyable and comedic on MG. The Love &amp; Marriage style show was way more entertaining and I like all the game shows like Family Feud as well, they usually get a few chuckles out of me. I also like that they usually have a magic show on Carnival, although I will admit the one on MG was pretty crap when we went. It was one of those illusionist types rather than like physical magic like cards, making things disappear, etc. Not for me personally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Staff/Service:**

Not a huge selling point for me since I'd like to think I'm not a complainer whatsoever, but there were a few things worth mentioning. I think a good cruise director can set the tone for a fun cruise and often makes or breaks a lot of the shows depending on how gregarious/funny/interesting they are and I do tend to like Carnival's cruise directors better. I actually thought the captain on Wonder was pretty funny though, I kind of wish he had been more vocal he usually had some good quips during his updates each day. As far as the rest of the service goes, I have mixed feelings for both. I feel that when Carnival makes their waitstaff sing and dance it can be a little bit cringe, but I feel that service on Wonder was kind of forced and scripted as well. Everyone was perfectly polite on both cruises but I feel like Carnival feels a bit more human and less robotic. Also I really missed towel animals on RC! I know they do them since my family I was traveling with got some, but our stateroom attendant didn't make any for us and I didn't care to make a stink about it since it isn't a huge deal but they are cute. &lt;3 In both cases we were well taken care of and both ships are kept very clean, but I feel like Carnival has a warmer/friendlier feel to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Smaller things:**

* **Wifi** \- We felt Carnival's wifi was better and more reliable. Both are expensive. I hope cruises soon adopt Virgin's model of just including internet someday since most people would prefer to stay connected or in many cases need to for whatever reason.
* **Atmosphere** \- Again, we preferred Mardi Gras by a margin. Wonder has some really cool areas, I liked the Solarium and Central Park looked really cool even though I never really had a reason to go there. But I think overall some of their decor budget is wasted, I don't really care for the giant tophat in the promenade. I also like that the MG has far more deck space. I feel like when I'm on a cruise I like to stay close to the water, it's relaxing and I don't typically spring for a balcony since you can typically enjoy the sea from on deck. That said, Wonder feels VERY enclosed. There are a few spots you can go to get a good view, but it feels way more like a big floating mall than a cruise ship.
* **App/website** \- Carnival's is way easier to use and less buggy. I also really hated how many things you needed to reserve to have a chance to do on Wonder of the Seas. I am a planner, but my family isn't and so trying to get us all scheduled for things was a nightmare. In the end we did have some success waiting in the non-reserved line for things but it's no guarantee, you could wait in line 40 minutes+ and may not have a spot. I also like that on Carnival's shore excursions you can see reviews. Reviews have saved me before from picking a booking I probably wouldn't have ended up enjoying, so I like being able to see what people enjoyed and what they didn't.

Anyways, I've written a manifesto and I want to remind everyone these are just my opinions! My husband and I jokingly said we will probably be Carnival diamond members before we try another RC cruise but I'm interested to see how others feel! I feel like if we try another line in the future we may try Virgin, since it's adults only and food-oriented I bet it would be up our ally.

Cruise," Hi!

**We are a mid-30s couple looking to book our first cruise to Alaska. We are first-time cruisers and it‚Äôs our first time to Alaska!**

We have narrowed it down to the below cruises and would like some help picking one. We are quite adventurous and will take part in a bunch of shore activities.

The cruises are not exactly comparable (Seabourn vs Princess e.g.) but we are planning to get the basic (Ocean View Suite) on Seabourn and the 2nd to highest cabin on others (e.g., Mini Suite on Princess or Signature Suite on Holland America)

We would spend a few days in Anchorage visiting Denali and Katmai (either before or after the cruise) and a do a daytrip to Glacier Bay NP as well. So, we don‚Äôt mind missing out on Glacier Bay on the itinerary.

Some concerns we have:

1. Would be significantly younger than the clientele of these cruises? Is so, which would be the closest to our age group?

2. How formal is Seabourn? Do we need suits/tuxes and evening gowns?

3. We are not big drinkers, so we don‚Äôt particularly care for the drinks‚Äô packages. We do like to enjoy good food.

4. On-board entertainment is welcome but not a deal breaker. We are happy reading a book.

5. Is one of these itineraries significantly better than the others? E.g., Seabourn has kayaking and zodiac options with the chance to visit the Inian Islands. That sounds like something we would like.

6. We want to prioritize wildlife viewing.

7. Our budget does not stretch to Uncruise / Lindblad.

Is it legitimate to hang out in your cabin or somewhere out of the way of the main traffic flows if you don't want to deal with the ""rat race"" of passengers all cramming to get off the ship? Or is this not allowed, and when it's time to leave you better be out of the room and have joined the queues of disembarking passengers?

I'm going on my first ever cruise later this year and I have a bit of a history of not being great on ships or boats. When I booked it I'd been told that the ship doesn't really feel like it's moving at all and I'll be fine, but since then I've spoke to a few people who experience seasickness who have told me the opposite. 

For some context I get sick on car journeys. I'm 30 years old and I still get that thing where I feel my stomach jump if I go over a hill. It takes me a while to adjust to my surroundings if I go on a train or anything, in the sense that I feel like I'm moving faster than I am and like I'm about to fall over all the time. When I get off elevators I have to hold on to the wall for a minute. On smaller boats I mostly vomit on and off for a few hours and/or completely lose my coordination for a few days and can't go in to confined spaces because they trigger a loss of balance. 

The biggest boat I have been on up until now was the Stena Superfast VIII and I felt nauseous to the point where I had to just sit with my head down and my eyes closed so I didn't throw up. It came in waves so I was able to get up and do stuff in ~20 minute intervals before feeling completely crippled with nausea again.

Then kept quoting prices for the cruise that I wanted that were higher than what I saw online. And I am a Diamond member. Now I got a credit with them that I am unsure how to use or retrieve.

The only reason why I cruise MSC is because they have international presence and their repositioning cruises take me where I need to go, and would otherwise need to fly to for about the same price.

Cruise,"My parents, my wife, and I will be going on an Alaskan cruise in July 2024\*.  My parents are treating us, and it's our first cruise.  I've been tasked with researching which cruise line to go with between Norwegian or Princess.  I'm leaning Princess since we're all 45+ in age, and we would prefer to avoid hordes of kids.  In researching which cruises and ships to go with, am I obsessing too much over avoiding older ships?  Is a ship built 20 years ago, but refurbished a couple years ago, just as good as a ship built a couple years ago?  Am I crazy for focusing on the newly built Discovery Princess over the 20-year old Sapphire Princess or 10-year old Royal Princess, for example?

Next question: In your opinion, which type of 7-day Alaskan cruise is better?  One-way or a roundtrip?   For reference, the roundtrip from Seattle is on the new Discovery Princess, while one of the one-way options would be the older Royal Princess.

Should we even stick to the choice of NCL v Princess, or should I try to talk my parents in Holland America Line?  HAL appears to skew to an even older demographic than Princess, so even less kids onboard is a plus.   I certainly like what I see of the Koningsdam, sailing out of Vancouver.

Cruise,"This was my experience on a recent Margaritaville at Sea cruise from Feb 5 to Feb 8, 2023. Please note this was my experience and other experiences could have been different. 

I do cruise often and enjoy them. I have been on cheaper cruises and higher end cruises so I had my mind set that this was going to be like nothing I have experienced. 

We took an Uber to the port, was dropped off and proceeded to the ‚Äúluggage check‚Äù counter. Upon entering the terminal, there is a big sign, no food or drinks allowed inside, this included a bottle of water I had to chug before entering. Once you enter, x-ray scanner, then hand your bag off to the attendant. Once you head upstairs, you check-in, which seems like a very long process, which I don‚Äôt think needed to be, but hey, it‚Äôs vacation so what‚Äôs a little line. 

After you check-in, here comes the head tilt. First, the customary photo on green screen, we passed, and a guy trying showing off the wine list asking us to buy a bottle before we get on board. From there we went to the excursion desk, ask about the specifics of the excursion and the attendant had no information for us. What time do we meet? A ticket under your door by 930p. How long does it last? A ticket under your door by 930p. Not exactly helpful or inviting. Since we purchased a drink package, we to that table and was told to go to the 8th floor to get the wristband. I asked where on the 8th floor, he said yes, 8th floor, but I said where and he said 8th floor. Then we went to the dining table. They wanted us to sign up for the premium dining, which I declined. He said enjoy the buffet. I said well what about dinner, he said buffet is open from x time to x time. Getting frustrated, I departed. As I rounded the table I see 1st dining and 2nd dining. I got back around and asked about 1st dining and 2nd. They said, sure what time would I like‚Ä¶..I said 2nd. I forgot to ask but they also didn‚Äôt tell me where the dining room was, which I had to ask later. 

Once I‚Äôm the ship, there really was no employees available to ask about directions, but found a map and headed towards the lunch buffet. It took us a few, but finally found it. The buffet food was edible, not ok, not great, not amazing, edible. The buffet line was separated into four different sections, which was confusing. 

The music, huge Buffett fan, was fantastic, the drinks were pricey and they kept pushing the souvenir cup which came pricey refills as well. The ship definitely shows her age: rust spots, oxidation, spaces with no real purpose, and the occasional whiff of sewer smell. Our room was ready early which was good, so we went there. 

We were on the 7th floor aft, towards the very back. The room was decorated nicely and was larger than I thought. There was an odor in the air which we couldn‚Äôt place but noticed stains on our bed sheets. We quickly called for a change and they were very responsive and apologetic. I was shocked there wasn‚Äôt a paper on daily activities but looked on the tv and tried to remember what we needed to do. 

We figured out were dinner was, which was interesting. The menu had choices, good, and the food was ok. The biggest shock was at the end of the night when a four top had only two guests and the waiter took a napkin, dusted off the crumbs, and set the other two places, not changing the table cloth or anything else. Also we were shocked to see that the premium dining area shared the same dining room, minus a small partition. 

The last major critique, besides entertainers forgetting words to songs, was that smell I mentioned in our room. After a while that smell was worse and worse that‚Äôs because when you flush the toilet, the sewer opened up and flowed onto the floor. The bath mat / towel smelled putrid. Plus we had to wash our feet every time we left the bathroom. 

To say I will not be returning is an understatement, just not my thing. I did enjoy escaping the dull of winter in Freeport but the ride there and back was not worth it in my opinion.

Cruise,"First time cruise with RC, and will probably be the last. OH has sailed prior to Covid and believes the company has gone way downhill. 
We had 2/3 ports cancelled due to bad weather and understand that this is a possibility but the way it was handled was really poor - in the form of a small on board credit. We paid $4k for our room and you give us $150 for missing two stops and then changing the other? Knowing people will end up spending more on board due to being on for 2 extra sea days. 
 Our one salvaged port was reduced greatly and the date change meaning we got 5 hours all up, and docked so late all tours and anything worth doing was completely sold out. 

The food was below average - the dining was really hit and miss in terms of organisation and food quality. Steaks over cooked or undercooked, rest of food just okay. 

Expensive - we like to splurge on holidays but the cost of everything was exorbitant compared to other cruises. The cheapest game of bingo was $40, drinks way above average of anywhere else. It just feels so money-focused it puts me off. The ‚Äúfree‚Äù activities were always booked out but the paid versions were available. Why not free and limit per room to ensure everyone gets an opportunity. 

On top of that, Covid was rampant and ended up getting it myself. It‚Äôs clear that their policy for having people test themselves prior to boarding is being abused - would perhaps work better if they made people test in front of staff. 

One thing to give credit for was how hard working the staff are, these people do such a tough job and are always pleasant. Interested to hear others opinions.",RC - downhill?,,lp211,,0,2023-02-11 01:27:46

Cruise,"Background: 5th/6th cruise. I usually sail Carnival with kids and family, first time on NCL, first time flying to a cruise port, sailed in an interior room with 2 other adult women.

Cruise reservation cost - approximately $300-400 per person

How I saved$$$

Flew Spirit at approximately $80 RT. I purchased one way tickets from DFW to FLL. Arrived one day before sailing. No checked bags or carryons. 

Booked an interior room for lowest rate. The interior room was excellent for sleeping in pure darkness. I didn't care for the room set up. It was two twin beds and one rollaway bed. The bedding on the rollaway was very comfy but it was hard to move through the room when the bed was down.

Removed added extras included in NCL promos. Many NCL packages will include the beverage package, specialty dining, etc. They add the packages but also charge gratuities. For 3 people for 3 day cruise the added gratuities for the drink package was approx $197. Only 2/3 of us were drinking and we are not heavy drinkers. We called ahead to remove the drinks and gratuties. We paid for drinks as we wanted them. 

The itinerary included two stops. One was replaced and one was canceled due to weather. We went to Nassau and spent $5/pp for a ferry boat to Atlantis, followed by a taxi to Cabbage Beach, and $5/pp in a shared taxi to return downtown Nassau near cruise port. I am definitely making this stop to Atlantis and Paradise Island again. We spent time at the casino and walked the shops. The beach was fairly clean but beautiful.  I think we overpaid on the ride to Cabbage Beach due to last-minute changes. We gave the driver $20 for 3 of us. Many great places to take photos and hang out.

On the last day, we had a lot of free time. Flights home departed around 5pm. We took a lyft to the FLL airport and got a day rental. We drive just a few miles to FLL Beach and Boardwalk for lunch. There are lots of great people watching and more cute shops. 

Biggest takeaways -


1.I'll definitely keep watching short itineraries out of Miami--especially to try different cruise lines.
2.I can't wait to get back to Atlantis (Casino lol) 
3. Another seamless travel experience on Spirit

Cruise,"Frankly, NCL's shore excursions for our Nordic cruise in August are way more expensive than they should be. For example, $200 per person for a 90 minute city walking tour. I've travelled a lot (though rarely by boat) and I know these city walking tours are often offered for free or for an optional donation. 

Or a particular tour I found from a 3rd party (identical itinerary) for $150/person while NCL is charging $450.

I know I can book some 3rd party excursions in advance, and I plan to book some. My question is, is it reasonable to expect to find some tour options offered in the port without booking them in advance?

I know it varies by port, but I just can't find a lot of information about these specific ports online. I've found reviews, but not a lot of specifics on booking 3rd party tours. I've searched this sub too, but most of the advice pertains to the Caribbean where I think there is enough demand to allow operators to book tours day-of. I'm worried the ""quieter"" ports we're going to will be more challenging in that regard.

For reference these are our ports of call:

1. Isafjordur, Iceland
2. Akureyri, Iceland
3. Ittoqqortoormiit, Greenland (so far I'm not even sure how we're supposed to dock at this tiny village, and I can't see any obvious tourism infrastructure)

Cruise,"My husband and I have been on 7 cruises so far.  All but one cruise has been on Royal.  We truly love Royal, never a bad experience.   Our first cruise was on Carnival, which we didn't like.  We like to get dressed up here and there, but for the most part we are a laid back, casual couple.  Royal has always suited us perfectly.

Next year we are planning on taking a cruise to include a stop in Aruba.  We prefer our departure port be in NJ/NY, but Florida is good too.  I've looked at Celebrity and Princess cruises, but to be honest they seem a little ""booshie"", ""snooty"" (maybe I'm wrong).  Since we've never been on either, we would love some reviews on Celebrity and Princess or any other cruise line that you think would be another option apart from Royal.

Hello. We are leaving on the above cruise coming up at the end of April. It starts in Barcelona and then goes to Cannes, France, Genoa, Italy, La Spezia, Italy, Civitavecchia, Italy and then Palma de Mallorca, Spain before returning to Barcelona

We took the Fantastica package because we had to as the cruise was selling out. It only added about $60 pp. We are trying to keep our costs down as we are going to another destination after the cruise.  We did add the excursion to Rome and the Vatican as we definitely wanted to see that but haven't added anything else yet.

Questions:  
What should we pack? 

Should we upgrade our stateroom \[with window view\] to balcony? Our best friends are joining us on this cruise and elected for window rooms - the exclaim that we likely will spend very little time in the room regardless. But I imagine it would be nice in the evenings to tuck away and enjoy the view on our balcony. 

We have ""free at the sea"" package. Of course we will be drinking and using our meal credits etc - What do you recommend we look for? 

We already paid for the cruise \[$3100?\] and prepaid gratuity \[$280\]. We are planning excursions every step of the way as well! We also need to book flights - can we get discounted flights through NCL?

Just wondering what on board activities are available on Princess? I've just booked a Majestic Princess cruise to New Zealand for next January. My husband and I sailed with Princess almost 10 years ago but to be honest didn't participate in any of the activities really, we're more the relaxing and reading by the pool type.

However, we've just come off an RCI cruise with our 6 year old daughter who had a blast at dance classes, trivia, arts and crafts etc. She wasn't much into kids club (I think it felt more like daycare and therefore not fun) but enjoyed going to all the other activities with me.

I know Princess is a little more upscale and relaxed, and because I don't recall what activities were available, I'm worried there'll be less for her to do?

Also do they show movies in the theatres? I remember them doing this out on deck but wonder if they do this indoors as well. She loved this on RCI and has already asked me if she can ""go to the movies"" on Princess.

Cruise,"First time cruiser and we are trying to plan out our excursions and port days. Since I've never gone, I'm looking for advice on making the best use of time. i.e. making our 'beach day' at the best beach and 'snorkeling day' at the bet snorkeling area.



## **Ocho Rios**

Due to this being the most negative place in terms of being bugged by locals, we are booking an excursion with the ship for **dolphin cove + Dunn falls**. That way we can avoid scammers and have the relaxation of knowing that the boat will wait for us on our first day. especially at this port.


## **Nassau**

Making this a ""beach day"" due to it not being as good as the next two ports. We want a day to relax. And there seem to be some public beaches here to do this.

## **Cozumel**

Snorkeling and/or Mr Sanchos beach club

## **Georgetown**

Walking around the port. Maybe swimming with stinrays, but more exploring on our own since this is the ""safest"" port","First timer, need advice on our plan for our port days (Nassau - Ocho Rios - Georgetown - Cozumel)",,ObjectiveDev,,0,2023-02-06 02:39:08
Cruise,Hope all are well this Sunday. I could really use some input from more experienced cruisers. Originally was supposed to book on a Carnival cruise (group of fiance‚Äôs buddys cruising) mid summer which he‚Äôd been informed about kind of last minute. By the time we were able to get the info all the cheaper cabins were booked so a no go . We are now looking into MSC namely meraviglia but my issue is that i‚Äôve read reviews that have me thinking that you are basically hoping to have a good experience as the reviews are either very good or very bad especially re:the food. People have also complained about the crew‚Äôs attitudes. Also my main concern are the stories of people waiting 5 hours or more for embarkation in hot weather which is a big problem for me with MS as i cannot stand extended periods especially in extreme heat. I‚Äôd noticed the Aurea SP?? package which claimed preferential embarkation it seemed over priced for what it offers and this was confirmed by watching vids on Youtube explaining the benefits of each.

Cruise,"Hi all, deciding which ship to book with for Alaska out of Vancouver. The Volendam cruise for June is about $1,600 and leaves mid week whereas the Koningsdam one is around $1,800 and leaves on a Saturday. 

Not too significant of a difference in pricing but is the extra $ worth it? I think the Koningsdam ship is newer and probably has a bit more on it.  Per the website, the K one has the pizza thing and V doesn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm from nyc so it doesn‚Äôt matter really for me

Cruise,"For the short and sweet that just want an overall star rating I would give it 3/5 stars because it just felt subpar and anything good was outweighed by the bad. I haven't cruised since before COVID so IDK if all cruise lines are like this now. My expereinces are below.

To start I'll say boarding the ship was a fairly smooth process. Took probably an hourish and we were in. 

The first day was rough. We had booked everything through the phone and were told that 4 adults could ""easily"" fit into one of their cabins. Having done so with Carnival in the past I took them at their word and booked a single cabin for 4 adults. We walked into the room to find 2 twin beds and a pullout. Not enough room for 4 adults at all. We went to guest services to see if we were given the wrong room and were told that the room options were either 2 twin beds with a pull out or a king size bed with a pullout. We asked how this could be described as fitting four adults at all when we were told it could ""easily"" fit 4. We asked if another cabin was available and were told that it was a full ship (remember this for later) and we would have to make do. Understanding we went back to the room to troubleshoot and used multiple pillows and a spare mattress to fundamentally convert the single pullout couch into a double bed. Later on, the 2 adults we were sharing a room with went to purchase some drinks and ordered 2 shots of Absolut and 2 strawberry daiquiris. This was $62 USD. After that absurd pricing they decided to purchase the drink package and were told that all members in the cabin would need to purchase the drink package. We tried explaining that my SO and I are sober and would not be drinking in which we were told we need to purchase the $300USD non-alcoholic beverage package. At this point we asked again if there were any available cabins to move into and were told again it was a full cruise and no cabins were available so we sucked it up and accepted the purchase. A frustrating start to the cruise, but nonetheless we were excited. A few hours later we overheard some other people on the cruise state that they had there room changed. This was surprising since that must have meant there was an available room for them to switch too. The next day, in our hallway, we saw multiple rooms with there SeaPass cards still on the door, meaning they hadn't showed up. So there were (most likely) rooms available for us to purchase but were told there was not and at this point it was too late since we had purchased the beverage package. This was a trend the entire week, getting on elevators with people saying that they are much happier with there new room, or that there keycard to the new room isn't working so they need to get it fixed. 

We went to dinner the first night and the server and his assistant server were very professional and hard working. I can assure you they tried there absolute best, however from night one it was clear they were overworked. We saw my server taking care of multiple large tables that all came in at the same time every night, which meant no matter how hard they worked they could not achieve proper service. Over the week, they forgot drinks, charged drinks to our table we did not have, forgot mains, delivered the wrong mains, forgot coffees, took a long time to bring drinks and did not check on the table during courses. However, as said previously it was clear they were working hard and trying their best, they were just simply understaffed and overworked. So when the manager came around to ask how everything was we didn't say anything about the service quality because it was clear the manager would just yell at them to do better and not fix the issue of understaffing.

Next, the buffet food was subpar. A few choices like the mac and cheese were good but one day it was good and the next day it was bland. There was little consistency and it often felt like I was eating yesterdays leftovers instead of fresh food. In addition, the buffets were closed and certain points of the day, from 1030am - 12pm, from 3pm-5pm, and from 8pm until the next morning the buffets were closed. If you were hungry at these times the only option was pizza. This was surprising as previous cruises I've attended had midnight buffets or 12 hour straight buffets. The closing of food was frustrating.

Next, the cruise was a money pit. $2.00USD for a tiny box of popcorn, $4.00USD for cotton candy, $9.00 USD for a small smoothie, $20.00USD for the escape room, no soda unless you had the beverage package, only drip coffee unless you had the drink package, any fitness class was an additional cost and I'm sure much more little fees that when paying for a cruise I would expect are free. To me, these fees should be included in the purchase price of the ticket but instead RCCL made the price of the ticket low to get us onboard and then basically said if you want anything onboard pay a fee. 

The onboard casino was intimidating. Many of the players there were kind and having a good time, but every dealer I came across was rude, intense, intimidating, and grilled me like I was from a rival gang or something. I played a few games of craps in the past but don't gamble often at all and so I never truly learned. I saw some guys having fun there so when the table was more empty I went over to join in and learn how to play. The ENTIRE time the casino staff grilled me, staring at me HARD watching my every move. So I went to play blackjack, a game I'm much more familiar with and enjoy playing and the exact same feeling was there as well. I tried different dealers/staff and every single one (with the exception of one lady) made me feel grossly uncomfortable. 

Entertainment was subpar aswell. There are 3 theatres, a jazz bar, a nightclub and a comedy club. The comedy was hilarious the first night, so we went to see the second night and it was the same comedians giving similar jokes. In a 30 minute set, 20 minutes were jokes I had heard the night before so I figured that entertainment was done but thoroughly enjoyed. The jazz bar, DJ, and musicians were absolutely amazing. However, on floor 5 when a band was playing I couldn't hear a word it was so loud. In the theatres, we watched HIRO which was cool, and the gameshow love and marriage which was hilarious. Every other show was either fully reserved or took place during our dinner at 8:00 pm. Although this was not a big deal because there weren't many other shows, the only other shows were hairspray, 1977 (or some number like that), flight, and I believe one other show. For a ship with 3 theatres I was expecting a bit more in entertainment to be frank. 

I figured with such a big ship I could find loungers for sea days to hang out on. Nope.

Design flaws like having the only smoking sections be in the casino, or in an enclosed space on the opposite side of the kids splashpad. A 5 minute walk across the ship and no water to be found anytime the buffets were closed other than on the 5th floor (the main floor) in the middle of the ship at the pizza place 

Getting on and off the ship was super easy and fast. The staff outside of the casino were very friendly and kind and hardworking. 

Honestly though, personally I will never cruise with RCCL ever again, and just hope that other cruise lines are not trying to cut corners at every opportunity post-covid like RCCL.",A Review of Symphony of the Seas (RCCL),,Nextgengameing,,0,2023-02-05 23:10:12

I know Hawaiian cruises are more expensive by nature due to it being a US flagged ship, so the pricing isn‚Äôt surprising. We are on the east coast so this would also mean much more expensive flights. 

Just looking for some input from anyone who has done both. Is the Hawaiian cruise worth all the expense?  I‚Äôm just concerned about going and feeling like it was a lot more expensive for much of the same feel. 

The cruise is 7 day, I checked an inside room and it would be about 5k without flights (I can cover those with points). For a 7 day Caribbean with the same budget you could essentially go all out.

We imagine we'll spend much of our time off the ship but like the idea of not having to unpack/repack ferry around that would be needed with a land only experience.

We value: 

* great service (with an easy going vibe), quality settings without being fussy
* great food and bev program 
* ability to enjoy water sports off the ship
* fast and easy on/off ship
* smaller ports
* comfortable stateroom for when we want to recharge (movies, room service, etc).
* occasional ambiance on ship - music, a bit of romance (love the sleeping under the stars option on SeaDream)

So far SeaDream Yacht Club is the leader for us but I'm not finding current (or many at all) current reviews. Windstar is a closer second - lots of reviews. We've also been looking into Windstar (a bit bigger ship). 

Would love to hear feedback from:

* folks who have been on SeaDream Yacht Club recently (last 5 years) especially doing Med routes.
* anyone who's been on SeaDream AND Windstar - comparatively  - SeaDream is more expensive - worth it? esp since the staterooms don't have verandas?

\- A pool on board with a pool bar

\- Good food. And I don't want to stress about whether or not we'll be able to get in the ""good"" restaurants because we didn't reserve in time or didn't know what to do

\- Explore new, interesting, beautiful areas of the world under the supervision of people who know what they're doing (as I said, we have never left the country and are intimidated by traveling abroad)

\- Entertainment (music, comedy, magic, etc.)

\- Not to be nickel and dimed by unexpected expenses. I would strongly prefer to pay more up front and keep the extra expenses few and far between.

\- Wifi would be nice to have but not a must

What we don't care about:

\- Casinos

\- Whether or not there are kid activities

Cruise,"Headed on a cruise this spring. And I‚Äôm really struggling with pain for the beverage package. If they didn‚Äôt charge us much for the day that you were in Port, and not on their island where it still counts, I would be perfectly fine with it. Since it has a three night cruise, you‚Äôre really only on the cruise half of the day for embarkation. Then the next day is a port stop and you‚Äôre in port most of the day the third day is their island where the drink package carries over so that‚Äôs fine and the final day you‚Äôll just get up and get off the ship.

All that being said, I am really considering using one of my two bottles of wine to bring rum or vodka. And then just purchasing some drinks at the individual cost. 

I‚Äôve been researching, and there are people who use water bottles and reseal them with caps from Amazon. People who replace the corks and foil seal people who use rum runners - the plastic bags.

Cruise,"So my best friend and I are former Disney Parks cast members who have never been on a Disney cruise - for the past two years we've made an annual WDW trip in August/September but we're thinking of switching it up and doing a cruise this year. We were thinking a 4 or 5 day Bahamas/Bermuda cruise sometime in that time frame, and we were both eager to try the Disney Wish since we hear it's a spectacular ship.

I started looking and price comparing, and noticed we could do a 5-7 night Royal Caribbean itinerary for quite literally almost half the price, and we wouldn't have to fly to cruise (RCCL goes out of New York, where we live, whereas we'd have to fly down to FL to cruise Disney). I've cruised RCCL before on Anthem and Liberty and enjoyed both, but they were large cruises with my extended family as a teen, so I haven't cruised as an adult. The RCCL itineraries we were looking at are on Anthem.

For Disney fans, do you think the large premium for a shorter Disney cruise is worth it? Like I said, I've been on the Anthem before and really enjoyed it, but I've never cruised on Disney (my friend has never cruised at all). I thought about choosing RCCL and using the money we'd save to go on a trip to Universal for Halloween Horror Nights later in the fall. But I've done that itinerary before, so it might be worth it to splurge for Disney.

We took a cruise from Singapore last week (Spectrum of the Seas), and we love trivia and game shows but kind of gave up on them after realizing how widespread cheating was. Every single game, if it was possible, lots of groups cheated, and very blatantly, with hosts doing nothing. I've never seen anything like this in the cruises departing from America.

Example 1: Host hands out a sheet with logic puzzles and 15 minutes to solve them. 75% of the groups immediately pull out their phones and start googling them. Not even furtively, just openly. Host says nothing. Ditto for the game where you identify cities from a photo.

Example 2: We're doing a quiz show where you identify something on a screen. As we go through the answers, the host comes around and asks who got a certain difficult one. Two of us give the right answer, everyone else is saying they had no answer or give wrong answers. He goes from table to table. Only two of us. Then at the end of the game? *THREE GROUPS CLAIM TO HAVE PERFECT SCORES*. And it's not either of us. None of those three knew that answer when he came to talk to them.

And of course there were the usual issues. 

* Host: ""What is the largest island?"" 
* Us: ""Are you counting continents like Australia as islands? If not, we know it's Greenland."" 
* Host: ""Sure, continents count.""
* We write down Australia.
*Host: The answer is Greenland!
* Us: But... you said continents like Australia count...

My partner and I are based in the US and would like to book a Caribbean cruise for late-February. It‚Äôs all very last-minute but we‚Äôre sick of the cold, gloomy weather and need a vitamin D boost.

We‚Äôve only been on one cruise before - to Alaska with Celebrity. After much research, we‚Äôd like to stick with Celebrity for now. We don‚Äôt have kids and would prefer something quieter, and the dates line up.

We‚Äôre Caribbean virgins. We like to spend time on beautiful beaches, go for hikes, and snorkel (if the reef is decent).

10 Day Eastern Caribbean on Celebrity Constellation in ocean view room. 

7 Day Bahamas, Mexico, and Grand Cayman on Celebrity Beyond in veranda room. 

Edge looks gorgeous but I worry the interior room will feel like a cupboard. I wouldn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd spend much time in there, but is it usually easy to get loungers on the pool deck? 

Constellation looks much older and not as nice as the others, but it‚Äôs far cheaper and the itinerary sounds ok. Thoughts?

I loved that we were able to visit so many places without having to pack up and deal with a new room/environment each day and worry about losing my things, everything is planned out in advance and I always knew what to expect, and being able to exploreand do stuff on the ship or find a quiet place to relax on my own schedule was wonderful. It was the best trip Ive ever been on and the first one where I didn't have any anxiety whatsoever. My mom agreed to do another for my 21st which is on May 15, 2024. It would be me, my mom, my dad, and my boyfriend. We are all on the autistic spectrum and very much introverted, and don't really like casinos or parties. we have a moderate budget, so no huge rooms or really upscale lines, but we can splurge on a couple nights of non-included dining and shore excursions. I don't really care for drinking or alcohol at all, so on my birthday I may just get like a small cocktail or something. I was looking at Virgin and Royal Carribean, but I am open to others. But here are my main questions:

1. Which lines have required alcohol packages and which have soda/juice/etc packages?
2.  What do different lines typically do for birthdays?
3. We would get 2 staterooms. My parents are split but very close friends, can they convert the bed into 2 twins? 
4. Which ships have the best places to sit by the ocean or just to relax away from crowds? 
5. Virgin's cruises in 2024 start and end right on my birthday, RC has one on Icon that's right on my birthday. Are big ships terrible when it comes to crowds/lines/ other social anxiety producing things? Or better since you can disappear into the crowd and not be noticed?",Best cruise for a 21st birthday with an autistic family?,,LowMemory578,,0,2023-02-02 17:49:36

My family of 4 are leaving on our first cruise in March, spring break, out of the Port of Miami on NCL for a 7 day cruise in the Caribbean.

Most of the posts online says this is not worth it, but everything I‚Äôve seen is 3 years old, in the middle of Covid, or the ship is not at capacity/small port, etcetera. So is it still not worth it, post Covid world, on what appears to be a fairly full ship, out of Miami?

Give or take, same price.  3 adults though.    


It has been maybe 20 years since I stayed in a standard balcony room and that was just with spouse.  Seabourn standard is at least the equivalent of a mini suite with a sofa on other lines but man.  That is not a lot of space.  My adult (by that time) son would have to be on the sofa bed.

We spend a LOT of time in our cabin and on our balcony.  Though if Seabourn is as chill/quiet as it sounds maybe we'd be more likely to read or such in other areas of the ship?  Not sure.

Quick question, hopefully able to get some answers. We're going on a Carnival cruise to the Caribbean in a few weeks, same port of departure and return.

We're in the process of trying to get a passport but we don't believe it will be here on time. We have a certified birth certificate, current state drivers license and certified marriage certificate all physically in our possession.

Example is...

Drivers license: **Jane Smith** (Smith being married surname)

Cruise,"Hello! I am somewhat of a beginner to cruises here (have only gone on 4 or so) so I was wondering if anybody might be able to suggest what a good first cruise would be for my wife, who has never been on one? 

It's just me and my wife. We are looking at any departure port from Florida since it's the closest to us and what I'm used to. We CAN look at other places to depart if the ship there would be REALLY worth it. Preferably we would like to drive there, and we are in South Carolina, so about a similar drive to Florida would be okay. We are planning a cruise of about a week but could do more. We will probably end up with a Caribbean cruise because that's just what's in Florida but don't really mind where we go. We have a fairly flexible budget, but obviously don't want to spend more than we need to, but if it's worth it we can spend a lil more. (trying not to spend over 5,000 on just booking alone) And we want it for summer, (can do up to september) since that's just when we like to spend our ocean-y vacations.

So right now I'm looking at Wonder of the Seas. Royal Caribbean is what I'm used to and am currently believing would be the ""best"" introduction to cruises, but like I said I'm inexperienced so I could be wrong. We are interested in other cruise lines from what we've seen (we really wanna try Virgin Voyages for example) but since I have no experience with them and my wife has never cruised, I am unsure and like I said, I want her to have a good experience on a first time cruise first to see if she would want to try other cruises in the future. Wonder of the Seas seems to have many things to do that she could enjoy, especially the shows. Though really, we're fine with having simple options like a pool available to lounge in when the mood strikes, or just having a place to watch a movie, things like that. 

The thing is the last cruise I went on was Harmony of the Seas about three years ago. I had a good experience overall, but I remember my time being specifically soured by crowds. I went in September but the pools were always chock full of kids and families so I never bothered to get in them even if I wanted to. At nights all the hot tubs were filled up with teenagers too. The lines just to get a snack by the pool were absurd. Excursions ended up just being a pain from the stress of the line of security. (I will probably opt out of excursions this time or limit them to only one) Also, people in crowds and the crowded pools tended to be openly and vocally rude, I guess about how I looked or cuz I had a pride tattoo or something, who knows lol. I feel like this kind of experience would be extremely bad for my wife. As she gets nervous in crowds and is especially insecure of being stared at. (she is trans) If people were this rude to me, a cis woman, I would worry quite a bit of how such an experience would affect her. She can handle crowds to some extent, but it's possible it could end up being too much.

So while a smaller ship would probably be ideal, and we are planning a late August booking, (right around the time when kids would start school, at least in Florida) I'm also afraid there wouldn't be as much to do. I'm wondering which is worth sacrificing more, less overcrowding or more things to do? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much, cruisers!",Suggestions on first cruise for semi crowd-fearing wife?,,LilyLaKoi,,0,2023-01-31 22:07:05
Cruise,"Hi all!

My husband and I are looking to book a cruise this December on the Celebrity Apex out of Ft Lauderdale. We're looking at prices right now, and there's not a ton of difference between the Concierge Class All Included fare and the AquaClass room.

First, I was wondering if the All Included fare is worthwhile. I did notice that the drink package that's included only covers drinks up to $10, which seems kind of low? On NCL, the basic drink package goes up to $15 (although it doesn't include coffee or bottled water, which I notice Celebrity does). Does this cover most drinks?

Second, is the Concierge Class worth it over the basic Verandah? How about the AquaClass over the Concierge Class? Is the actual concierge service decent? We do like a nice thermal suite, but there are only 2 at sea days, and we'll probably spend a decent amount of time off of the ship.

Cruise,"TLDR: Me and my fiance are going to pretend to get engaged for the first time on our cruise. How would you maximize the changes of us getting comped something? 

Me and my fiance are going to be going on a NCL cruise this summer. We've heard stories before about being given free stuff by cruise directors when something big happens on board. Like if you let the staff know it's your birthday, anniversary, honeymoon, etc. They might send you a bottle of champagne or comp a meal or something to that effect. Nothing crazy, but something big enough to either lock in repeat-cruisers (we've only used NCL once about 4 years back) or get to put on a public show of generosity. Or maybe because they're actually nice, but what are the odds of that, right?

We're already engaged, but we figure we may as well do a fake proposal on board and see if we get something. Current plan is to pick a public place when we're within earshot of the cruise director, or failing that, just the first night at dinner. We'll already have practiced our fake reactions.

We've narrowed it down based on price, dates, and itinerary to either the MSC Sinfonia or Virgin's brand new Resilient Lady (it will be her maiden voyage), and would love any advice from experienced cruisers. 

I've seen tons of negative MSC reviews, but most are pre-pandemic and for cruises in the Bahamas. I've seen tons of positive Virgin reviews, but obviously for different ships and different itineraries. It's a $1300 price difference for a balcony and free drinks (Virgin has a $600 tab offer, and that should realistically cover us). Both itineraries are almost the same, with only one full sailing day, so we don't anticipate needing a lot of entertainment or activities on the ship, and we'll really only be eating breakfast (maybe) and dinner on the ship, except for the one sailing day. 

We love the idea of adults-only, but we're wondering if it's risky to be on a maiden voyage (like when new restaurants open, I don't like to be the first guests because they usually have totally normal growing pains/kinks to work out). Is that a justified concern, or is Virgin pretty good right from the start?

Cruise,"My fiance and I are looking into cruises to take for our November honeymoon, and we are currently interested in two different cruises (these are currently the only two cruises that work with our timeframe that go to areas we are interested in):  
1) 14-Day ""Passage to America"" (Holland America Land) Rome -&gt; Fort Lauderdale, FL, which has a total of 8 days at sea, 5 of them all in a row (last leg of the trip to get to America)

2) 14-Day Mediterranean &amp; Israel (Princess) Rome -&gt; which only has a total of 3 days at sea.

This is my first time cruise (my fiances second), and I am super afraid of getting sea sick, so the second option seems better, but I'm afraid I will feel so exhausted with option 2. I know you don't have to get off the boat at every port, but it feels like a waste not to, especially since that cruise is stopping at so many historical, likely once-in-a-lifetime areas.

I loved all the build your own stations. However the MDR, not so much.  I'm sorry to say I'm beyond disappointed by the MDR food on Celebrity Summit. People talk trash about Carnival, but MDR on the Mardi Gras was a lot better. Plus carnival has several extra free dining options that are really good. Back to Celebrity, Most offerings were fish or chicken and the occasional flavorless roast pork, and the classic MDR thin steak. Part of the problem wasn't even the options, it was that everything was so very plain and bland tasting. The French onion soup is still great, but apart from that MDR was a big let down. They also got rid of the beef wellington. Even lobster night was sad, they brought out these tiny little lobster tails, and had the audacity to ask for $18.95 for extra orders. They did taste good, I'll give them that. As far as Tuscan Grille goes, their pasta and appetizer options are mostly good, some hit and miss, but if you order the 10oz ribeye, You're going to get the same thin sad steak you would get in the MDR just in ribeye form. Keep in mind it's $64.90 with tip per person to dine at Tuscan. What is the $55 going towards if not decent main entrees. I can get a steak 10 times better than that at outback for $25. I booked with Celebrity because everyone talked about how great their food was. I guess that was before Jan 1st?

Cruise,"Wife and I are going on a cruise Sunday. We're experimenting with not buying the booze package this time. Not that we go crazy with the booze package, but my brain tends to think, ""well, it wasn't cheap and the bar is right there, might as well..."" So, many mornings tend to be less fun than I'd like.

Yada yada, skipping the booze package. The plan is to buy drinks and just act like an adult. Also, the plan was to bring the 2 bottles per stateroom that we've long heard about but never tried (why bother when you have the booze package, right?)

So, I was looking to see if that was limited to 750ml (it is), but as it turns out, the FAQ says 2 bottles per guest, and I've found some online discussions have noticed this.

[https://www.celebritycruises.com/faqs/before-you-board](https://www.celebritycruises.com/faqs/before-you-board)

Some of the speculation is that Celebrity is pushing the ""all inclusive"" pretty hard, so letting more bottles on board may actually reduce the alcohol the cruise needs to pay for if people bring bottles they like from home, and non-booze package people may pay the corkage fee (we'll probably do that at dinner).

One concern brought up is that the people working the boat might not be aware of that policy.

Cruise,"Cruise Line: Norwegian

Ship: Breakaway

Port of Origin: New Orleans, LA

Itinerary: Western Caribbean, 7 days (Day 1 at-sea, Costa Maya, Harvest Caye, Roatan, Cozumel, Day 2 at-sea, New Orleans)

Pros:  Free-At-Sea package is a must.  All-inclusive drink package is incredible.  Two specialty dining meals in the package is phenomenal (paid for the additional two meal upgrade).  Staff was stellar and the balcony cabin in the package put the cherry on top.  Highly recommend the French restaurant Le Bistro.  

Cons:  Other cruisers.  For the meals we did not dine at the specialty restaurants we at the the Garden Cafe buffet which was great food quality-wise.  I told my girlfriend who I was with that I've seen better buffet etiquette at a Golden Corral or Old Country Buffet.  No one follows a general flow and people will cut in front of you, stand out in the middle of the walkway, and are generally pretty rude.  All around the ship no one seems to have any awareness of where they are standing and will block passageways without a care.  It got better as people spread out during the week but the first couple of days were pretty frustrating.  To top it all off, my girlfriend came out with Covid at the end of the cruise which is a bummer.  My guess is that there were people who knew they had it or at least knew they were sick when the came aboard.  My opinion, sure, but there were people in line before boarding that were clearly not feeling well.  Is what it is, I guess.

Excursions:  We did excursions at each port.  We went to the Kohunlich Mayan ruins in Costa Maya to start.  We're really into history and it was a great site.  The one downside is that it's a 2 hr bus ride from the port to the site so keep that in mind.  Overall very good.  Harvest Caye was a beach day.  Norwegian has it all to themselves and it was a nice chill day on a very beautiful beach.  Roatan was our favorite.  Highly recommend the Island Sightseeing and Beach tour.  Our tour guide was top shelf and she spared no detail on all things Roatan.  The excursion ended with about two hours at a very nice beach on the south side of the island.  Now that brings us to Cozumel.  Ugh.  First off, the weather was crappy.  Rained on us all day.  We booked the Tulum Mayan Ruins and was very much looking forward to it.  The ferry ride from Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen was rough.  My girlfriend got very seasick and she's been sailing for 30+ years on sailboats.  When we got to the mainland it was pouring and the walk from the pier to the busses are about 15 minutes.  When we finally got on the bus it was about an hour drive to the site.  During the bus ride the tour guides were trying to sell us on buying tacos and various jewelry.  Pretty low brow in my opinion.  When we finally got to the site it was a gauntlet of people trying to sell their wares before even getting to the ruins.  I've spent a lot of time in Mexico and am used to it so I wasn't surprised.  What was disappointing was that we only got about 45 minutes in the archaeological zone and was rushed back to the bus.  Upon returning back to Playa Del Carmen we were basically dropped off at a mall for about two hours before returning back to the ferry.  The ferry ride back to the ship was even more rough than the ride out.  I served in the Navy for 20 years and it was bordering on unsafe with the way the ferry was getting thrown around.  Crappy day all around.  Do not recommend that excursion even if the weather was nice.  I would recommend staying on Cozumel and avoid the ferry altogether.

Cruise,"First of all, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading on various opinions about the NCL upgrade advantage program and I think I understand the risks involved. But I‚Äôm still not sure what the best option is for me so I‚Äôm looking for a little (more) advice. 

I‚Äôll be going on my second cruise in March, out of NYC to the Bahamas for 8 nights, traveling with my mom. (She‚Äôs early 70‚Äôs, I‚Äôm early 40‚Äôs F.) For both of us, our first cruise was almost 10 years ago, also to the Bahamas on NCL, 4 days out of Miami. I booked this mostly as a way to get out of New England in the winter that was pretty reasonably priced compared to a week at a resort in Mexico, which was my (solo) escape last year. I was going to go by myself in a studio cabin, but the balcony rooms were very reasonably priced (our base price was $929 pp) so I invited my mom along and we booked just a few days ago. The itinerary wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice, since I‚Äôve already been to the Bahamas and Cape Canaveral doesn‚Äôt really interest me, but it‚Äôs certainly better than snow and freezing rain! 

My ideal vacation involves luxuriating by the ocean/pool, snorkeling, really anything involving water. Super loud parties are not our thing, and I tried to get us a cabin that wouldn‚Äôt be too near anything especially noisy. I settled on a family balcony room because a) it was roughly mid-ship and I‚Äôm worried about rough weather even though we‚Äôre not especially prone to seasickness b) I researched and found that deck 13 has all cabins both above and below and was a pretty desirable spot for a balcony. The other time I cruised we had an ocean view/porthole room so I‚Äôm excited about having our own balcony this time!

I got the email with the offer to upgrade to a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù room yesterday, and I‚Äôm considering making a bid for a spa balcony room (minimum $100 pp). I know the weekly passes for the thermal spa are $300 ish pp, so getting one for $100 would obviously be a great discount. (I have no idea the likelihood of getting it for the minimum though.) Since we‚Äôre sailing out on NYC in March and having multiple at sea days, I think we‚Äôd probably get a lot of use out of the spa passes. My mom may go into withdrawal over not having a bathtub for a week, so she would definitely love it, and I think we‚Äôd both appreciate it being adults only on top of all the spa features. 

Now I‚Äôve read the stories of people who bid on an upgrade and get it, only to find that the prices drop closer to sailing and they regret not just calling to see about getting an adjustment to the lower price. So I‚Äôve considered watching the prices, but all of the spa balconies were ‚Äúsold out‚Äù when I made the reservation, so I don‚Äôt have the option of starting a new booking to look at the current price of them. And I have no idea if the current prices are likely to drop further before sailing (&lt;50 days out), making it worthwhile to call and ask about an upgrade directly. I‚Äôm someone who really appreciates getting the best value for the money, and the spa is probably the best possible perk for us, but I‚Äôm a little wary of regretting the decision. I also know that the spa balconies are all on deck 14 fairly far forward, and I definitely don‚Äôt want to end up with something in an undesirable location. 

So I guess my questions are: Is it possible we could get a spa balcony for a minimum (or just over) bid? No way to tell how many of them are still available since they‚Äôre listed as sold out. Anybody have a bad experience with the spa balcony cabins? Too noisy/far away from things/etc? Are there ever any specials on the spa passes that would make it worth waiting? If I do want to call NCL directly, what would be the best way to inquire about getting a spa balcony for a good (~$100) price? Or is this a great offer that I‚Äôd be crazy not to jump at right now?

Thank you, and I‚Äôd also appreciate any other tips/tricks that are less well known than the ‚Äúfish swim to the front of the boat‚Äù and ‚Äúmake reservations early‚Äù variety!",Convince me (not) to bid on upgrade NCL Breakaway,,SmartPlenty4549,,0,2023-01-30 20:36:52

Pros:

1) Depart from Los Angeles, which is convenient for me, so I don't need to fly to the cruise port.

Cons:

1) More expensive than the **Celebrity Summit** itinerary 

2) Older than **Celebrity Summit,** as the staterooms and other public and private areas are not recently renovated.

Pros:

1) Cheaper cruise fare than the **Celebrity Solstice** itinerary

The kids are younger and, when looking at the ports (Spain, France, 3 in Italy), I'm curious if I'll even want to book excursions or if we should just head out and explore for the day. They've never been to Europe, so everything will be new to them and a day of walking, shopping, eating the like will likely be more fruitful than booking an expensive excursion.

A couple questions - for those that have taken the family on these trips before, what option did you choose? Are there cities that would benefit more from a guided tour than others, ie Rome due to the size?

And lastly, is it recommended I book the trains into the cities myself (Florence, Rome) or do it via the cruise options?

Ports are Mallorca, Marseilles, Florence, Rome and Naples.

Cruise,"My husband and I just disembarked our first NCL cruise on the Breakaway today from New Orleans. The cruise was okay, but we probably won't be cruising with NCL again. 

The ship had a sewage smell going on in alot of places. Some of the public restrooms smelled bad like pee and the pool deck sometimes smelled like vomit. 

The food in the MDR was so bland that we only ate there for two of our seven nights and chose the buffet instead. We tried Moderno and wasn't impressed. The salad bar was good, but meat and sides weren't great. I consider myself a junk food connoisseur so for me to not like the quality of food is saying something lol.

The drink package was good. The bars were constantly very busy, but the servers and bartenders were doing great keeping up. Unfortunately, NCL is really overworking their staff especially the bartenders. You could tell at times they were drowning. The ship was packed at full capacity. 

We thought the shows were great! The adult comedy shows and magic shows were our faves. We also really enjoyed the Waterfront. We had booked an interior cabin so having a nice outdoor space to retreat to was a perk. 
We also booked the thermal spa for the week and it was our saving grace to get away from the hustle and bustle of the crowded areas.

The one thing I'm puzzled about is our room steward. He never cleaned our room for the entire 7 night cruise. We had to put dishes and dirty towels outside of our room at the door. He saw us doing it and never offered to come and clean the room. He would just pick them up after we walked away. We had to take clean towels and toilet paper from the spa to get by. Our trash was overflowing when we left. I  saw him constantly cleaning the suites across from us and was sort of annoyed that therein rooms stayed spotless and we couldn't even get our toilet cleaned. I didn't mention anything because I don't want to get any staff in trouble, but it just seemed kind of shitty. I usually leave a great tip for the room steward at the end of the cruise, but just couldn't do it this time.

Cruise,"* Ship: Ruby Princess
* Ports: Cozumel, Belize City, and Roatan
* Round trip from Galveston, TX; 7 days total

I traveled with my boyfriend and our two best friends, who are a married couple. My boyfriend and I are late 20s and our friends are early 30s. The occasion was for the wife's 30th birthday, which fell in December but is very near Christmas, so she chose to celebrate it with a trip in January and my boyfriend and I asked if we could tag along. She picked this cruise because it was apparently $10 cheaper than the other cruise leaving port at the same time and she read that Princess had the best food. 

It's important that I emphasize this point: I am a pretty type-B person. I went into this with *literally zero expectations* and *planned/researched almost nothing ahead of time* and I still had a great time. I also learned a lot and have a lot of thoughts and opinions about what I'd do differently were I to cruise again. I hope my decompression thoughts help another first time cruiser. 

* Arrival was extremely easy and went smoothly. We drove down from Austin the morning of, pretty early, and had lunch in Galveston before we found our parking lot and boarded. We'd completed our onboarding documentation ahead of time on the app and I would encourage others to do the same - we didn't have to wait in any lines and basically got to walk onto the boat from the time we got dropped off by the parking shuttle to the time we were on the boat. The muster process was virtual and very easy.
* The ship vibes gave me ""an older boat that was once extremely nice, has been well maintained, but is definitely not modern anymore."" Everything was clean, everything worked perfectly, and it was all Nice(tm), but just kind of old. Think wood paneled walls, goofy hotel carpeting patterns, just kind of...chintzy. 
* This segues into the next heavily vibes-impacting factor: this particular cruise ship's demographic. To be blunt: this cruise was old as hell. My friends and I were easily some of the youngest people on the entire boat, besides literal children. If you're a frequent cruiser you might be thinking ""duh, you dumb bitch, schools are in session, and Princess is an older cruise line"" but this didn't even cross my mind before we traveled, so I wanted to spell this out very clearly for anyone who might be reading this who is like me. If you want to cruise in January in the offseason and are a young person, are party- or nightlife-minded, or just want something fresher and more modern, keep this in mind.
* The entertainment and the vibes followed the demographic of the ship: just generally geared towards older people. Again, if you're a seasoned cruiser, you're still probably thinking ""duh, you dumb bitch"" but I tried to go into this with little to no expectations so it was all brand new to me. Most people ate early and the dining rooms seemed packed at 5 PM. The nightlife was pretty tame but still enjoyable: trivia, bingo, movies, etc. There wasn't a lot of stuff like silent discos - think more ""live pianist in a lounge while people play cards."" The birthday girl in our party was really into all the programming and we tagged along to most of it, but we also spent a lot of time on the decks reading, drinking, and chilling and played a lot of Trivial Pursuit and Scattergories, which was fine with me. We unexpectedly really enjoyed the game shows put on by the cruise director staff but as word got out about how fun they were, the harder it got to get seats in the lounges they took place in and we had to stand for both of the last two. Our friends that we were traveling with weren't interested in the nightclub or the casino (or really staying up late at all), but my boyfriend and I were able to make friends with some other young people and we tried out the club a few times. The club was, as you might expect from the cruise ship's demographic, not crowded, but I thought the DJ was funny and played fun music. I didn't think the comedian was very funny but the crowd seemed to like him. We didn't attend any of the singing or dancing style shows. I thought the movie options each day were pretty good and I appreciated that they showed the NFL games the first Sunday we were at sea. 
* The food and dining experience was really good! We made reservations each night for the same time and I do recommend this. If you do this and want to change your reservation or show up earlier, we learned that it's better to talk to them in advance instead of change it in the app - the first time we changed it in the app, they seemed completely unprepared for us and asked us to just come early and ask in person. The next nights we did just go early and were always walked right to our same table with minimal, if any, wait. We really enjoyed having the same waitress each night, too - she was very kind and pleasant, and we were able to get to know her by seeing her each night. The food itself was similar to the same vibes as the whole ship - nothing extremely modern or experimental, but always correct and tasty. They served lots of classic, old-fashioned stuff: think duck a l'orange, beef Wellington, etc. I *loved* the fun freedom of getting to get a slice of pizza or a soft serve on the deck. We never ate in any of the other restaurants because we never felt a need to - the food in the main dining rooms was just fine for us. I also liked the free room service and enjoyed being able to order like, a Coke to my room when I had a headache, or a drink to a random lounge. 
* The ports were the area that I wish I had researched the most. I followed my boyfriend's guidance about the excursions and the ports because he had been on a Caribbean Princess cruise about 10 years before as a senior in high school with family and friends. (He is also relatively type B and we were both looking for a relaxing vacation and were open to being flexible.) This meant that we didn't have a plan for the port days, and it unsurprisingly turned out that 10 years ago and being a drunk high schooler at the time made his recollections foggy. He made it seem like it was a) easier to book excursions last minute if we wanted to and b) easy to go to a beach or relaxation spot if we didn't like the excursions. This was really not the case, and I would encourage anyone who is easygoing like me and didn't want to book excursions ahead of time to have at least some plan on each port day, or be willing to be flexible. The beaches on each port were only really accessible by taxi trip, not an easy walk. We mostly wandered around each port, ate and drank, and then got back on the boat. In Cozumel this was fine and we did find a cheap private snorkel tour that was great fun (the guide didn't speak any English and the boat was ratty but the snorkeling was great), but in Belize City I ended up getting pretty disappointed that we didn't book an excursion. Belize City is not very developed, Belize itself is an impoverished nation, and once we left the very small port there was not much to do at all. This might have ruined the day had I not been able to shake it off and be flexible, but we regrouped, had a chill lunch and a Belikin, and then got back on the boat. The next day was Roatan and I really wanted to have a beach day so we did plan and execute that, and I'm glad of it. We found a very kind taxi driver to take us to the West Bay of the island and he picked us up again for $120 USD round trip for four people. Roatan was beautiful and the beach was scenic. We roughed it on our towels in the sand just fine (no major sunburns!) but if you wanted a beach chair with an umbrella it would have been about $15-$20 USD for the whole day. 
* Minor other tips, tricks, and thoughts - I had no idea about the lack of outlets in the staterooms and that was annoying. I wish we'd booked a room with a window if only for better Circadian rhythm syncing - the lack of natural light really fucked with my ability to wake up each morning and I'm sure my boyfriend felt like he was waking the dead each day. There were two formal dining nights and I really enjoyed getting dressed up. There was more room to unpack than I expected and I was glad I took the time to do that. There were a few little touches that were old fashioned that I actually really liked (they give damp towels and water out when you get back on the boat from the ports, extremely clutch on a hot day). My only minor complaints with dining were that sometimes it seemed like they occasionally lost us using the Medallion system (we ordered drinks a couple of times that were marked delivered but never found us) and that it seemed kind of hard to just get water to drink on this ship. I'm a millennial - I like to drink water! I brought a large reusable cup for the trip but it was kind of a pain to have to go up to the food court to fill up the cup each time I wanted more water to drink than one single glass at a time from the bar. I should have been bolder about asking the bartenders to give me larger glasses to drink or filling up my cup for me. The afternoon tea on Friday was extremely fun and the scones were delicious. My boyfriend and I did not get the Internet or the drinks package and I don't regret not getting it - I'm the bigger drinking of the two of us and even I think I only *averaged* maybe four alcoholic drinks a day, one specialty coffee, and a handful of sodas. 

This is all I could think of as a true first-timer who didn't prepare very much. In summary, great vacation, would cruise again, but would probably do more research next time about excursions and would maybe book a newer/more modern ship or go at a time of year with more young people.",A type B true cruise rookie's very thorough review and recap of her first ever cruise,,saradactyl25,,0,2023-01-30 00:17:22

I've even been told ""You're supposed to walk on the right""

Which, seems strange to me given the majority walk on the left.

I mean, obviously as a cruise that left Australia, we do most things on the left, drive on the left, pass on the left, feed the ducks on the left, etc. So it stands to reason that you would walk on the left.

I feel if we sailed out of the USA, more people would walk on the right, so that's where the flow would be.

But I'm curious how others feel.

I narrowed it down with the types of boats I‚Äôm really after - which are either the new Celebration or the Horizon. With my research, they look pretty comparable and think I‚Äôll be happy with both. 

6 day on the Carnival Horizon - 
Miami &gt; Ocho Rios, Jamaica &gt; Grand Cayman &gt; Cozumel Mexico &gt; Miami (days 2 &amp; 6 are at sea) 

7 day on the Carnival Celebration -
Miami &gt; Amber Cove, Dominican Republic &gt; San Juan, Puerto Rico, &gt; St Maarten, British Islands &gt; Miami (days 2, 6, &amp; 7 are at sea) 

There‚Äôs also the same itinerary for the 7 day for another cruise but just goes to St Thomas US islands, rather than St Maarten but think I ruled it out because St Maarten is more appealing to me, but if you have an option on those two islands lmk.  

There‚Äôs about a $400 difference between the two. The two different boats don‚Äôt seem to be a huge factor, but if the ports on the 7 night are really that much worth it to spend the extra money I will.

This group was not mentioned anywhere in the booking process until I received my final email confirmations and now I have no idea what to do.

Cruise,"Good day all. My GF and I are booked on our first cruise together (Her first ever cruise and my 5th but its been years since my last) in February. I had some concerns about my flights and wanted advice on connections and anything we can do to make the trip there a success. This is the first time I have had to worry about connections on holidays as we usually fly a more direct route and its to a hotel type resort not a set time cruise.

We booked a week in the Caribbean with Norwegian on the Prima and purchased the included flights deal as it worked out cheaper then booking our own flights. 

My concern is the the flights prior to the cruise we are slated to land in Orlando on the morning of the cruise at 6 am so there is a little room for error but not for missing connections which is my issue.

The Flights they booked start the afternoon of the day before where we will fly from our small city to Calgary international where we only have 1hr 40 min to catch our connection to LAX then we get 1hr 30 min to catch our flight to Orlando.

This seems to be pushing it for time on the flights so I wanted to see if anyone had advice for going thru these airports.

Cruise,"We are planning to go on a family cruise in 2024 to celebrate some of our family members important milestone. Last night I was given the dates and they want to do Royal Symphony of the Seas.

I‚Äôve only sailed NCL (multiple times) and like how the pricing is much more straightforward. From what I am seeing on this particular sailing, it‚Äôs around $2k per adult and that doesn‚Äôt include a drink package or anything. 

Do you purchase that on the ship?

This pricing is for a balcony room and it feels like a lot but we are also sailing in the height of the summer.

I was looking at pics of the interior rooms and they look much more spacious than NCL interior rooms. We normally sail balcony but for the price Royal charges I am thinking it makes much more sense to do interior since nothing is even added to the base price yet.

Please let me know of any other differences between the 2 lines I should know about. 

This is a Bahamas sailing which we‚Äôve done several times on NCL already.  

I think my family likes the idea of Royal‚Äôs private island for the kids.

Our options are:

- direct flight at 7PM the night before, gets to Fort Lauderdale at 11PM, hotel (Jet Blue)

- direct flight that arrives at 10AM day of cruise, so 4 hours to spare (no checked bags), first flight of the day on that route (southwest)

-connecting flights, and I am not about to get stuck in some random city 

This is in late February in Nashville. Statistically, weather has a 1% chance of being a problem. My thinking is, if weather is an issue, how likely is it that the JetBlue flight ‚Äúthe day before‚Äù would make it while the Southwest flight the next morning wouldn‚Äôt?

I am big on hiking, so whichever one I don't choose I will find some trails or something to go and explore, so that may be a consideration as well, if one of these ports are much better for hiking then kayaking.

I know in this case, drinks/tips/wifi wouldn't be included like it usually is for Aquaclass, but does anyone know from experience if we would still get access to the thermal suite included? Or any special spa stuff when getting Aquaclass as an offer?
2. The drink packages are crazy, for the basic one it's like over $1000 for 2 people on a week cruise. I also gamble a lot and I know Celebrity gives drinks out to people playing in the casino. But I drink a lot too and would love the drink package. Has anyone ever gotten buddy-buddy with the casino host and been offered these types of perks while on the cruise? It was alleged to me they have a budget per cruise for things like this. If I do get friendly with the host, would it be inappropriate to bluntly ask?
3. Anyone who has ranked up through Blue Chip Club, it sounds like you automatically get a free cruise offer when reaching Onyx.

I'd never heard of this policy on any line so I was surprised and asked her to clarify. She did.

Cruise,"My parents are celebrating their 40th anniversary this year and want to go on their first cruise this year. The (adult) kids want to join. After some preliminary filtering (mom wants 6-8 days, embark and disembark at American poets, New England and Canada itinerary), it appears we‚Äôve narrowed it down to either:
-Princess (Emerald) 7-day Canada and New England, round trip out of New York
-Royal Caribbean (Serenade) 7-Day Canada cruise, round trip out of Boston

There are a couple of RC 9-day cruises that are kind of in the running, but it‚Äôs harder for everyone to get out of work. 

Demographics of the travelers:
-Parents (early 60s)
-Son 1 and spouse (early 30s)
-Son 2 and spouse (late 20s)
-Son 3 and spouse (mid 20s)
Small chance my sister comes with her 5 y/o, but unlikely. 

Son 1 has done Alaska (HAL) and Mediterranean (NCL). Son 2 has done Mexico (Carnival). Everyone likely will buy a balcony room.

Generally, we like to eat and hang out, but we‚Äôre not really partiers (though we are Italian). Would only have a drink or two a day. Mostly looking for relaxation, good food, interesting shows (the nerdy shit on HAL, for example), and a smooth ride. Everyone is healthy, able to walk long distances, up for everything from ghost tours to go carts to zip lining to hiking to visiting breweries. 

Both RC and Princess seem like great options to me. Cruisecritic (I know, I know) seems to rate these similarly, and it‚Äôs hard to differentiate.

I rarely post on reddit especially when I reference the higher end ""Ship-Within-A-Ship"" experience I have.  Yet I write on social media all the time about how to get as much value from your cruising experience. Also, how to enhance your cruising experience with realistic expectations.

The second cruise showed a significant negative change in all of those areas.  The last cruise was even worse.  The cruise line cutbacks are significant which is surprising because the costs have gone up.  

My challenge is if the cost goes up and the quality goes down, how can I or anyone else justify the product.  Why does a reduction in quality in products and services have to happen.  I am disappointed and want to know if I am the only one with this experience.

Cruise,"
I'm considering going on a cruise, but I'm a first timer.

Just looking for information/advice please:

- I'm a 29 Male here, is there cruises for younger people, or are they generally mixed age ranges?

- Does the Cruise line matter facility wise, package wise, entertainment wise etc?

- A horror story, that puts me off of cruises, is if illness breaks out, they quarantine/isolate the ship. But why spend all that money to sit in your room? Is there protections on getting refunds for this outcome?

- I've been reading that WiFi is separate, no problem, I think it would be nice to have no WiFi so I can truly relax without the worry of my phone pinging, but I could easily download books/Netflix stuff beforehand if I wanted to.

- How strict is the dress code? I'm not into super fancy meals with black tie stuff, never have been really.

- With the excursions offered in the port or on the cruise ship, what if I decided I didn't want to go on one? Are the ports usually near active areas or close enough by public transport?

- I see that some company's offer an All Inclusive drinks package, is this worth it?

- If visas are necessary at each port, can I get them, there and then? Or do I have to have had sorted it beforehand?

- Any recommendations on where to go and how long for as a first timer?

Cruise,"I am very interested in Virgin, which seems to tick a lot of my boxes--great food, pretty much all-inclusive minus booze, chill vibes, no kids.  Plus, the appeal of cruising for me is the ship experience rather than the itinerary (which most people view as VV's weak point).  But there are still a couple of things I am not sure about, mostly about the basic day-to-day experience.

1. I really enjoyed spending hours in the pool reading my Kindle every day.  It seems like the VV pools are much smaller--could I still comfortably read in them?  Are there other places to read in the water?  Do I need to get a suite to get a bathtub?
2. What did an average day look like in terms of activities?  I liked the variety on RCI--live music, trivia, shows (even if somewhat corny), etc.  My sense is that VV has more pop-up entertainment and small-scale performances.  Did that work for you?  What did a standard day at sea involve?
3. How raunchy was the experience?  I am probably more prudish than average, and I don't know whether the cunnilingus-named ice cream shop, the sex-themed show, and the sex toy box thing in the room reflect the general vibe/tenor on board.

Cruise,"Went on a cruise with Royal Caribbean last month. While at the buffet one morning pouring my coffee, the nozzle of the dispenser unexpectedly slipped and squirted scalding coffee all over my hand, causing severe burns. Upon returning later, it became apparent that the locking mechanism of the dispenser was not locked, which would have prevented it from twisting in the first place.

Talked to several of the staff there, and they all acknowledged that it was their mistake. However, returned to inspect other coffee dispensers later on, and came to realize that about 1/3 of them had their nozzles in the unlocked position. After bringing this up to one of the floor managers, they were shocked that such little care was going in to locking the mechanisms so that their customers could safely pour their own coffee.

Days ago I got a phone call from Royal Caribbean, saying that after reviewing my case, there was no instance of employee negligence, and that the company acted responsibly on the matter, since the medical facility on board treated my burn. However, as a gesture of goodwill, they offered me a credit of $153 dollars to be used toward any Royal Caribbean cruise within the next 1 year. They made it clear with me that they were not obligated to do this nice gesture, and that if I would agree, to please sign the release form.

I asked them about the nature of this form. ""Does it restrict my legal capabilities in any way?"", I asked. ""No, if you choose to sue Royal Caribbean, that is entirely up to you"". I found this to be an odd thing to say, so I checked into the release that they sent me, and sure enough, it was buried somewhere in the legal verbiage that ""by accepting this, you release and forever discharge ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD., its affiliates liable or who might be claimed to be liable"".

So this is the behaviour of the world's biggest cruise ship line. Suffice to say, if you suffer personal injury or harm on board a Royal Caribbean cruise, you are pretty much on your own.

Cruise,"We booked with Viking and in 10 minutes on this subreddit I'm learning we already screwed up (flights through the cruise line).

But my question is about getting hit with a cancellation fee.

We booked 4 people on our cruise. 3 of us are related. The 4th is one of our co-workers. A week before the full payment due the co-worker cancelled. (They didn't even tell us... they only told the cruise and not even in writing so it wasn't official) Sooo that sucked.

Then we replace the passenger ourselves and are sent an invoice for a cancellation fee. And now we're really pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

* We're being charged a cancellation fee because someone else cancelled?
* The representative we spoke to understood how it wasn't fair but wouldn't do jack to reverse or reduce the charge. Same with their supervisor. You could tell that the supervisor never reversed a charge in their life and was proud of it.
* But there's some things we still don't understand. Like what do they do if a person books alone and cancels? Wouldn't they go after the fee from that person? If so why aren't they doing that in this scenario?
* The 3 of us purchased travel insurance. The 4th who bailed said they didn't want the insurance because they were sure they wouldn't cancel. What is super frustrating is that the cancellation fee is 2x what the travel insurance was. It would have been better for us to buy the travel insurance on their behalf! We would have saved a ton of money! The supervisor wouldn't agree to reduce the fee to the price of the travel insurance either, which would have been reasonable.
* They could not justify the $700 fee. We understand if flights and whatever else had been purchased under that persons name, but none of that has happened yet. We haven't even got to the deadline for guest documentation nor full payment. So there's nothing on their end they would even do at this point other than change a name on the booking.

So I guess my questions are:

1. Is this normal?
2. We agreed to the cancellation fee for ourselves, but we never agreed to pay a cancellation fee for someone else. Is this allowed or are they taking advantage of the situation and sticking us with the bill instead of someone they know won't pay?
3. If someone books alone and has not paid in full (down payment only) what would the cruise do? And why aren't they doing the same thing here?
4. What options do we have to fix this crap?

This is really souring the whole trip before it even starts. It's very tempting to cut our losses and book somewhere else properly.",I'm a newb and need help to see if this is normal (whack cancellation fee),,jadin-,,0,2023-01-20 22:57:07

3. How worried should we be of transmissible diseases?  Covid has pretty well settled here at home, but we don't have any idea what to expect on a boat. Are all areas of the ship open to the public, or are some common areas closed off? 
4. Any advice as to which destinations and cruiselines that would be idea for bringing a baby? I think our favourites back in the day were Celebrity and Princess, while we weren't fans of Holland America (could have changed, though in the time we've been away).

Cruise,"Hi y‚Äôall! Long time lurker, first time poster!

So I‚Äôm not much of a gambler. I used to work in a riverboat casino and after spending too much time holding the hands of people who really needed to be going to GA meetings, I lost any pretense that I could ever make a profit from the slots or tables. Having said that, I do occasionally enjoy spending time in casinos in a transactional kind of way. For example, I went to a casino hotel in a big tourist spot recently because it was the least expensive hotel. I had an attached offer for dinner for 2 and a nice other couple of things if I gambled an amount that was less than the dinner, plus I got a couple of free drinks for my time while playing. I‚Äôm not a gambler, but I am a discount hunter so I was willing to spend that amount in the casino to get something else that I wanted at a steep discount. (Think $50 of play to get a $100 dinner, if numbers make it make sense. It really was a low ‚Äústeaks‚Äù situation (haha, I kill me).

I‚Äôm currently in the very very early planning stages for what will likely be a Caribbean vacation. I‚Äôm not the type to gamble, but again I am transactional. If I‚Äôm not being too personal, how much did you gamble before you started receiving comp offers for free/heavily discounted cruises? I know if the casino thinks they‚Äôll keep making money on me they‚Äôll pay for me to be on board, and from the tales I see in here it‚Äôs kind of like a gift that keeps on giving once you spend the right amount. 

I don‚Äôt want to count on being a winner, but I know it happens. I‚Äôm fully expecting to spend $XXX in the casino with a goal of receiving $XXX in future cruises in return. I just want to know if the X is a realistic number for my particular budget, and if it works out to actually be a savings if you play your cards right by losing.

Cruise,"I have never been on a cruise but have been planning on taking one with my significant other this April. Neither of us have ever gone on a cruise and since we are both young budget does play a huge part in our choice. After countless hours of browsing we narrowed down our options to two  


**Choice 1: 2500$ Norwegian Cruise Package with a room with no window**  


**Choice 2: 1300$ MSC Cruise Package with a balcony**  


At first it seemed like a no brainer 1200$ less and you get much more... but after reading reviews on this thread, Expedia, and Travelocity I am more confused then when I started. How can a cruise line be so good but at the same time so bad? How can people say the food is on par with Royal Caribbean, while others say that they wish they hadn't eaten for a week instead. Is it just people finding things to look to complain for or is there actually just such a big inconsistency in MSC Service?  


Are there any recent cruisers with MSC that can shed some light on my decision please. Preferably if you took the **Meraviglia** out of New York. Do I just risk it and get the cheaper cruise, or pay 1.2K extra for the guarantee that our food won't be bad? Thank you so much for your time!  


**TLDR:** MSC is 1200$ cheaper than its competitor and on paper offers more. Is it really bad, or should I say screw it and just book it for 1300$ and make the most out of it?",First Time Cruiser Tempted By MSC Cruise. Is It Really That Bad?,,WhiteWiesslogia,,0,2023-01-20 04:25:06
Cruise,"I'm going on a 7 day cruise next month on Norwegian Escape. The package I got comes with 150 minutes of wifi. I'm a little worried because while it sounds like a lot, I imagine those minutes go by fast when you are using it. I also worry if the wifi is really slow, then I'll be using a lot of minutes just to get pages to load and things to send.

I don't need my phone for a lot, I'm on vacation so obviously I'd like to keep usage to a minimum. Honestly the main thing I want to make sure I have it  for is to keep my snapchat streaks. That's as simple as a quick picture and send every day, assuming the wifi is good enough to send snaps. So that shouldn't take much time. And I'd like to be able to check in with my friends everyday and just send a couple messages to some people, and quickly check the email daily just to make sure nothing important. 

So does anyone have experience with wifi on Norwegian? Did you find 150 minutes enough? Do apps like snapchat work fine with it? How does it work? Do you just sign in to the wifi and can use any app and just have to disconnect when you are done? 

Also, do ports usually have some free wifi that you can connect to?

Cruise,"My parents (70s) and my partner and I (38) just got off a 10 day Oceania cruise. It was my first cruise ever and their second, so I‚Äôm not sure how it compares to other lines and in which ways. 

Things we liked:

-	casual dress code, as in no ties required anywhere
-	almost all amenities available to all cabin levels. I think only the spa deck with the fancy hot tub was restricted to concierge and up passengers
-	freedom to dine anywhere at at times and bring food wherever
-	very few kids
-	daily string quartet performances in the main lounge
-	total lack of nickel-and-diming on board‚Äîalcohol, spa treatments, and excursions were the only things not included in the base price
-	comfortable, modern rooms with nice verandas

Thus my parents weren‚Äôt a fan of:

-	Size. Our ship held 1250 passengers, which is obviously small, but service felt impersonal (although very, very polished)
-	Other passengers‚Äîit was all snooty boomers who didn‚Äôt seem interested in socializing outside of their group and seemed to treat the staff like trash
-	The kind of general obsequiousness of the staff. My parents (socialist college professor and former nun/retired social worker) hate being treated like ‚Äúrich people‚Äù and like to chit chat with their servers etc. The staff all acted very much like ‚Äúthe help.‚Äù

TLDR: everything was very nice and very high quality, but also a bit much. 

Oh and about the food since that‚Äôs Oceania‚Äôs thing: it was good. It was all very high quality with different menus every day in the two main dining rooms. They handled allergies extremely well. Unlimited fillet mignon and lobster tail were available in every restaurant and 24 hours a day through room service. All of the specialty restaurants were excellent. As a former food person, however, my only complaints were that everything seemed tailored to 80 year olds from Kansas who think cumin is exotic and a fillet mignon is better than a ribeye. There weren‚Äôt really many interesting choices and not a single thing was spicy. (They were able to do a decently spicy Thai curry when I requested it though.) Overall I‚Äôd say 10/10 for quality, variety, and presentation, and 3/10 for originality, which is probably exactly what their customer base is looking for.

I also was looking online and saw additional restaurants (Eatly) that are not classified as speciality or included. Can anyone speak to these other options highlighted ? I was also curious how much extra the food at the oyster bar is? 

I also was wondering if tips are included when you pay? I have seen some posts on here about getting hit with a big bill but I think I already paid tips when booking. 

For bars, I purchased the premium package (up to $15 per drink) and I was wondering does that work everywhere onboard aside from the chocolate shop? I wanted to verify it would work at the places onboard including speciality dining. 

My next step of questions is on the excursions available. We will be stopping in Nassau, Ocean Cay, costa Maya, and Cozumel. For Nassau we will be swimming with dolphins and for Ocean Cay we will be doing the set ski tour. We will be going to Blue Lagoon for the dolphins. Is this better than balmoral island? Also which ruins out of the ones valuable at costa maya or Cozumel is better? 

Lastly‚Ä¶ for theme nights‚Ä¶. Seems like two formal nights and possibly a night party is all I need to prepare for based on research. Can anyone speak to this?

Cruise,"We booked a last-minute cruise on Princess that sets sail the last week of February. It's a closed-loop itinerary from Fort Lauderdale with stops at Princess Cays, St. Maarten, and St. Thomas. My husband and I both have passports, but my husband's passport expires 5 months after the cruise, not 6. We (of course) checked the travel documents requirements before booking the last-minute sailing since we knew his passport was under 6 months from expiry, and Princess's guidelines say that a passport isn't required for closed-loop Caribbean itineraries unless they stop in Martinique or Gaudeloupe. I confirmed this with a customer service rep, and we do have a birth certificate and driver's license as backup. Neither the Bahamas nor St. Maarten even has a 6 month requirement, so even if we were to get stranded, he could fly home on his current passport.

There's plenty of variations of this, where someone talks about their experience on a resort line and someone criticizes them for not going on a $6k 100 passenger ultra luxury line. 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and it makes perfect sense that some people strongly prefer the ultra premium lines. It's totally cool to express that!

However, there's a difference between expressing your preference and disparaging someone because they can't afford an ultra premium line.

My family and I just completed our first cruise on Disney and to say we caught the cruising bug would be an understatement. 

We love Disney and thought the experience was great but also recognize that there is a premium that comes with Disney's brand and experiences (It was awesome seeing so many characters on the ship). 

Just because of the price we are open to exploring other cruise lines as alternatives to Disney but one major concern we have is the fact that we have young children (currently 1 and 4). On Disney the kids clubs were AMAZING. At dinner on the first night our 1 year old fell asleep (at like 6:30) and we were able to take him to the Small World Nursery on board while we enjoyed the entertainment and nightlife. 

We expect Disney to be great for families (even those with small children) but I have no clue what to expect on other lines.

Cruise,"I‚Äôve never seen a cruise ship so poorly organized. I‚Äôm on the NCL Encore right now for my honeymoon, and with peace and love this ship is a hot mess. God bless the employees doing their best.

The first day, the muster drill was complete chaos. Nothing was clearly labeled for where people should go. They went around to everyone‚Äôs tables telling them to go to the drill since it was starting in 15 minutes, and we had to ask a crew member where it even was because there was no signage. When we went to that deck, the area was so crowded that we were packed like sardines, trying desperately to find whichever person had the sign for where we needed to end up. We were on deck 6, and our station was D2, but literally there were only signs that said D. We had no idea what was going on, and it was a dangerous situation. Then when we FINALLY got to the correct section, we were reprimanded by the leader guy for having been there too early before they were ready and that‚Äôs why it was chaotic. Even though they specifically told us to get up and go. You‚Äôd think the ship would just have actual signs and directions for muster stations, but that would be too easy. Then we were yelled at for being on our phones (while waiting for it to start) by the leader with big middle manager energy, and he was so combative and unprofessional. He made sure we knew his name was Alexis.

There was some other tomfoolery on board since my husband had special dietary needs and there was confusion about when/where to pre-order his meals. But what was ridiculous was that at the first port at Great Stirrup Cay, they had only three tender boats taking everyone back, leading to a massive line to get back on the ship. How were they surprised that thousands of people were trying to come back at the designated time? Maybe it‚Äôs because there was another Norwegian ship at that particular port with us, but it was still truly ridiculous. The employees were super nice and making sure to hand out refreshments for those in line so no one would get dehydrated, but it was more of a bandaid on the situation.

(As a bonus, this ship is always rocking and rolling. Idk if it‚Äôs just that there‚Äôs constantly a huge amount of wind, but I‚Äôve never felt a large ship with so much movement!)

This is truly the ratchetest cruise I‚Äôve ever been on, and I‚Äôve been on the day cruise to Freeport twice. I will definitely not be traveling with NCL ever again. I used to work at the Port of Miami checking in the NCL guests, and I guess this place had to come back to haunt me one last time.

Cruise,"Hello r/Cruise, I just got off MSC Seascape and a lot of you have had questions, concerns, and gripes, with MSC so I decided to write this trip review!

For some background, this was my 6th cruise (1 Celebrity, 1 Princess, 2 Royal, 2 MSC), and my previous experience with MSC in 2016 was poor, however, I decided to give them a shot because brand new ship with a free balcony upgrade and $200 onboard credit is hard to say no to.

The Food:

I kept a daily journal of the food on board but I won't post that because it's too long. 

* The breakfast buffet was pretty solid, the made-to-order omelet and the cinnamon pecan rolls were a must for me every morning. 
* The lunch buffet was where the food fell a bit flat, every day it was the same food with minor changes and most of it was pretty bland, however, one day I did find Ropa Vieja which was very good, and another day they had Butter Chicken alongside other Indian dishes which looked very appetizing and I regret not trying. The pizza is always a safe bet. Burgers were okayish except for the bread which was always overtoasted/dry.
* For lunch on our day at sea, we opted in to eat at Kaito Sushi, a specialty restaurant that does conveyor belt sushi. Normally the way the restaurant works is that plates come in different colors corresponding to different prices. Luckily for us though, on the day of our reservation, the restaurant was having a special which was all-you-can-eat in 45 minutes for $33 per person including dessert. It was pretty good. Our tab would have definitely been over $60 per person with all that we ate.
* We had dinner every night in the dining room. The food was very good. Yes, the bread was cold (if you get that reference), but that doesn't detract from the experience. Standouts from the dining room include Slow Roasted Prime Rib, Jerk Pork Salad, Lamb Curry, Key Lime Pie (better than any I've had in Florida), Coconut Ice Cream, Lobster Bisque, Steak Tartare, Bouillabaisse Proven√ßal, Cabernet-Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Shank, Crab Cakes, Coconut Tapioca Pudding, Limoncello Cake, and Tiramisu. For me, the best dish in the dining room was the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle, I am still thinking about it.

The Bad (and the Good):

* I remember seeing someone on reddit complaining about the size of the water cups and I must agree, they are very small and it's inconvenient when the water stations at the buffet are so few, very spread out, and are usually crowded.
* The water is very good, if you've had desalinated water, you can tell it's desalinated water, but the desal taste is barely noticeable. In addition, the water did wonders to my hair and skin, I dread going back to Florida's crusty, crunchy, hard water.
* The temperature of the jacuzzis is very low? The water felt near or slightly above body temperature, which really sucked on the day we were at sea because the wind was very strong and cold, we just wanted to warm up a bit :(
* The jacuzzis on deck 8 are my favorite, they're so neat for when you're arriving or leaving a port.
* Getting around cruise ships is usually a tricky task, Seascape makes things more complicated, it has a lot of dead ends, most are because public areas end and Yacht Club/crew area begins, but others are some weird design choices. Something I didn't realize until my second day at sea was that there isn't a single deck (excluding the ones that are only staterooms) where you can go from bow to aft without having to backtrack or go up/down to a different deck. tl;dr: no running/jogging track.
* Le Cabaret Rouge is the best venue onboard, the performances there are better than at the Chora Theater.
* The shows at the Chora Theater are weak, the shows tend to be very similar but the performers are dressed differently: 2-4 people singing, 1 really flexible lady, some ballet and choreo.
* The ship is gorgeous.
* The cruise director and the assistant cruise director were wonderful.
* Our cabin had a bathtub, I considered that a win until we actually showered. There is no curtain, only a small glass divider that doesn't move, unless you are very careful when showering, all the floor (and possibly the toilet too) will get wet/soaked.
* Another thing I remember seeing on reddit was people complaining about the smart elevators. Personally, it didn't bother me much, it just needs some tweaking because the time estimates over 30-second waits are wayyyyy off.

The Okay (i.e. other stuff):

* Ocean Cay was wonderful, it is a beautiful place and we can't wait to go back. The food is the same as the onboard lunch buffet but more limited.
* Kayak, paddleboard, snorkeling, and jet ski rentals at Ocean Cay sell out too fast though, not because of demand, but rather supply.
* The itinerary was really good (Ocean Cay, Nassau, San Juan, Puerto Plata), the only thing I would have changed was to skip Nassau and add a stop in the Virgin Islands or Sint Maarten.
* My only gripe with the itinerary was how much time we got in the ports. We got about 6 hours in Ocean Cay but 2 hours were lost on an impromptu storm. We left Ocean Cay at 4:30pm despite the next port being super close? We arrived to Nassau at 7am and left at 1:30pm? We arrived to San Juan at 10am??? and left at 4:30pm??? 10am to 5:30pm in Puerto Plata was perfect though.

Is it the same as other cruises where when you  get off the ship at each of the ports in the Canary Islands, tour operators will be standing by to take you on the various tours that you may have not booked on Viator or with the cruise previously?

There are a few things I'd like to do,  but I'm having a hard time finding exactly what I want.  I have cruised many other parts of the world and just about every port has a lineup of taxis and tour companies waiting to take you on whatever trip you want.

After 12 weeks, we reached out to Park West and was told it was ‚Äúin framing.‚Äù At the four month mark we had not heard anything back and the birthday had passed so we asked for a refund. The customer service agent told us that no refunds were possible. Park West was unable to explain why the artwork had not shipped and could not give a timeline for shipping. I asked for the issue to be escalated to someone else because I wanted to work things out amicably before resorting to a credit card dispute. The customer service agent refused. 

We filed a credit card dispute since at point over four months had passed and we had not receieved the artwork. 

It‚Äôs now been six months. Our dispute was found in our favor and we received our money back. But I‚Äôm still blown away ‚Äî six months and they never sent the artwork. 

I know under the FTC I didn‚Äôt need to do this, but they are such a mess that I did email them tonight to reiterate that they should not ship the artwork at this point because the dispute was found in our favor.

Cruise,"Our first ever cruise was on Celebrity in Alaska in 2016. Second was last year via Disney to Bahamas and Cozumel. I didn‚Äôt think I would like cruises, but both experiences exceeded expectations. 

For our third, we tried the Norwegian Joy close to the recent Christmas holidays. We were disappointed with long, long wait times for boarding and disembarking, especially when initially boarding (almost 3 hours!) and tendering to and from Cabo San Lucas. Nothing seemed to be going according to schedule throughout the trip. (There were some technical problems with the anchor which threw us off schedule, but we didn‚Äôt hold that against them.) We were confused by needing a ticket/reservation for everything, which wasn‚Äôt very clear to us as new NCL travelers that had only booked two weeks prior, and we missed our chance to do some of the things we hoped to do on board. 

One gripe - booked a 3 hour excursion to snorkel in Cabo. We spent an hour waiting to be loaded onto the tender, but only got to spend about 20 minutes of our 3 hours in the water, and closer to 2-2.5 hours with the group leading the tour. When I complained about this later, guest services said the time spent on the tender boat headed to the port counted as part of the excursion time, which we found goofy. At Cabo, we got in line to return to the Joy by tender an hour before our deadline, and the line stretched what seemed like a third of a mile back and barely moved. We waited an hour and a half for a tender, and everyone around us was pissed and confused. And hungry. Princess Cruises had an identical trip that clearly had a process that was working wherever we went, and they boarded their last tender according to schedule in a reasonable line that moved quickly at Cabo. 

I figured that might be our last time trying NCL, but I did overhear a few guests mention that it wasn‚Äôt normal for things to be so off. Not sure I would book again, but I thought I would get this sub‚Äôs take before completely counting them out in the future. 

I did like NCL‚Äôs food! I also liked our balcony. We moved our futon cushions to the balcony for a private sunbathing spot, which was great because it was pretty crowded elsewhere. Cushions fit perfectly and basking in the sun is my favorite memory from the trip.",First time trying NCL - maybe our last,,rocksinafield,,0,2023-01-14 21:27:31

And when I look at the ports and excursions (I'm looking at the Caribbean) no ports really jump out at me (except for maybe ruins in Mexico). I don't scuba or anything and shopping isn't really an interest of mine. I've never been to the Caribbean, though, so maybe just general sightseeing would be good.  (I would like to be on a beach for a day, though, to walk on the sand.)  

If all of this is the case, wouldn't an all-inclusive resort be a better option? I'm not interested in slides or bumper cars or anything, but  I'm not really worried about being bored if I don't get off the ship. What I'm now wondering is, if all I want is to essentially stay in one place -  on a ship - how is that different from an all-inclusive resort? (Is an all-inclusive better/cheaper?)

Questions that I've had...how many hours can I reasonably expect to spend in each port if say 9am is arrival and 5pm is sail?  Is it okay to keep the reservations I made for tours through Viator, or is it better to use the NCL-recommended tours? How much of a factor is cabin size really?

Cruise,"Hello,

Our family of 4 (our kids are 13m but celebrating his birthday and 9f) is struggling to choose our next cruise.  Last June, we took the Norwegian Joy to Bermuda and absolutely loved it.  We loved the restaurants, the activities.  The ship was spotless and we were never bored or hungry.  Bermuda was beautiful, easy to navigate and safe.  

We were looking at the Carnival Venezia for this June.  It will be brand new (I believe we are looking at their second US Sailing).  My husband and I cruised Carnival 15 years ago for our honeymoon but don't remember a lot from the experience.  We did enjoy it, however.  My concern is we are struggling to get a lower room and I do get sea sick.  (If anyone has any insight on the movement of the 9th floor of a Vista class ship, I'd love to know).

The Carnival Cruise is significantly cheaper and the boat will be nearly brand new coming out of refurbishment.  Even the restaurants and menus aren't fully announced so it may be a neat experience to try something new.  They're also doing Amber Cove, Grand Turk, and Half Moon Cay.  We haven;t been to any of these places.

Cruise,"So I just spent the afternoon on hold with Princess and I am beyond frustrated. We have sailed with them before and had a very nice time. We booked another cruise, but somehow in the booking process, Princess signed up my husband but not me, even though fares for both were paid. It took a phone call to resolve the issue and get us both on the reservation. Finally, everything is resolved except our reservation for the dining room. Somehow making a reservation where we eat together is causing a technical glitch that has been escalated to tech support and we are instructed to call again in five days to see whether the problem has been fixed. 

This whole process has taken hours of my day and I was placed on hold once and the call was dropped, so I had to call again and wait again to speak to a human. I am disappointed. I was very happy with the actual cruise experience last time, but it doesn't seem too much to ask to have a booking process that just works, or can be easily corrected if it fails. Making a reservation for a couple sailing together in the dining room is part of their core business and seems like it should be a no brainer.

Cruise,"So last month I decided to buy my parents a cruise trip for Christmas. I had purchased everything on carnival‚Äôs website and even prepaid gratuities to get it over with, or so I thought. Flash forward to today I had received an email specifying that prices for gratuity will increase after April. The email even had a link to pre pay for gratuities to ‚Äúsave‚Äù money. Well I was curious and selected the link and very well upon inspecting my booking it did not mention anywhere that I had prepaid anything and if I would like to add it. I went ahead and called carnival and they said they did not see anything on their end. I am 100% sure I had added this to my payment before completing the purchase. In addition to this, the agent somewhat confirmed the math. I wasn‚Äôt sure the exact amount of the gratuities were, but she stated it was roughly $87. When I had initially looked into booking this the total price was about $589 without gratuities. In the end I had selected to add them to cart which then raised it to about $676. The agent mentioned that I had never added that anywhere and that my booking price without tips were $676. I cannot emphasize enough that I am sure I added this on.

Its a couple years later, and while VV is still high on our radar, our next vacation is going to be with our 6 year old. 

Last year we did 2 weeks at DW and my daughter absolutely loved the Magic of it all.  My husband and I are ehhhh on the Disney factor, but at the same time he's a huge Marvel/Starwars fan and anything in that genre makes him giddy.

I am someone who enjoys ""luxury"", a really good spa day, upgraded restaurants, but am working with a reasonably modest budget here.  I work in the service industry, so when I travel, I do enjoy being pampered and spending money on things that I find value in.  Ie, I'll book a suite not necessarily for the space, but extra perks like not waiting in lines, access to room service, etc.  

Now, to add another wrench to all of this - we live in The Bahamas, so Bahamian itineraries don't interest me at all, so if we were to pick a Disney Bahamas itinerary it would be entirely based on the ship being the destination and focus of our vacation enjoyment.

Is a 4 night Disney cruise, in a Ocean View room, really worth 2-3x the cost of a 7-9 night trip in a Balcony or even entry level Suite on one of the RCCL ships?

Cruise,"Hey cruising community, I'm usually not one to make a sub post regarding personal needs, but I really don't know where else to turn.  

Short backstory: 

My gf and I just booked a 4 night bahama's cruise aboard the MSC Meraviglia through [cruisedirect.com](https://cruisedirect.com) ;   we got a balcony suite that claimed ""Free Drinks &amp; Wifi Package"" , I had even taken a picture of the icon under the bonus category before clicking confirm.   Upon purchasing, I received an email of confirmation that show's my bill, as well as my itinerary with the packages it includes.  On the final bill it clearly says in this email ""New Years Sale - Free Drinks &amp; Wifi + Kids Sail Free""  is included in my purchase. 

I called cruisedirect yesterday to go over my trip details, and was shocked to hear that neither my girlfriend or I have the free drinks and wifi package.   I provided her with my receipt email which she was able to clearly see on her computer, and she said she would ""call msc"".  She called me back to tell me that there is nothing her or MSC can do, and claimed that at the bottom of the promo it says ""ask about the New Years Sale before Booking"" which really means nothing to me, especially considering that there were no promo code fields or anything of that matter to *physically input the promo*.  Also, it clearly says in my email that it's included!!! 

The final conclusion she came to, is that she would need to cancel my existing booking, which will take 30 to 90 business days to get my money back, and the initial total of $800 American will change to $1000 American grand total.   I told her that I am not accepting that, and only because I clearly have on my receipt the free drinks and wifi promo package that was included.  It feels like false advertising to me, and I am more upset that I am not being entitled to something that was clearly on my final receipt.   

I am now waiting for a phone call from the supervisor in which *Queen* the associate I was speaking to said she would have him call me.   It's been almost an hour, so I decided to call the number myself and speak to a manager directly, only to be greeted by *Queen* on the phone again.  So now I am worried as to if this website is even legit to begin with.  I find it very sketchy that 2 times in a row I was connected to *Queen*.  In which last night she was assisting me outside of her office is what it sounded like on the phone.  

With our flights and hotel already booked, I can't just accept a cancellation for an answer which was where my frustration by the end of the call was stemming from.  I also do not want to sit 1-3 months waiting for $1100 CAD to come back to my credit card.   I am not sure what my next steps of action are to take if the manager comes back with the same answer.  Do I call MSC? Do I take cruisedirect to court regarding this matter?  To me it feels like being no better than going to your local best buy and buying something only to open up the box to something completely different when your receipt clearly says otherwise.  It just feels like such a scam to me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone dealt with cruisedirect before? and if so how reputable of a company are they?

Wi-Fi coverage throughout the ship was very inconsistent.  There were four cabins in my party on Decks 10 and 6.  Some reported good Wi-Fi coverage, where I was (10162, forward by elevators) coverage was almost non-existent.  

The Wi-Fi struggled and even dropped connections when crowds were present.  Most notable: the promenade on deck 5, Amber Theater, and Aqua Theater.  The pool deck, the solarium, Central Park and surprisingly the Windjammer had the most reliable coverage.  Something to take into consideration if you need to make a work phone call.

Cruise,"How rare is it to get stranded in Mexico without a passport?

We are booked for a  4 day cruise from Miami to Cozumel Mexico and have never been before. It's a closed loop cruise so we were told we could just use our birth certificate and driver's license. But I've seen some posts that make me concerned that we could potentially be left stranded when we come back on board from a shore excursion because we are traveling without passports. How often does that happen? We were considering a ship sponsored shore excursion. Is it even worth risking getting off the boat in Mexico? 

P.S. it was a last minute book and there isn't time to apply for a passport",How rare is it to get stranded in Mexico without a passport (cruise),,evinalae,,0,2023-01-11 13:02:30

Cruise,"Hi all! Taking my first cruise in April on the Majestic Princess from Sydney to Aukland.

It is 5 days and the first 2.5 days are ‚Äúat sea‚Äù.

The reservation says there is 1 formal night and I have a few questions.

What night is formal night?

Is the food different than if I were to sit down at one of the included (free) dining room restaurants and ordered off the menu there?

Other than how people are dressed, how is Formal Night different than any other night in terms of dinner experience?

I am going with my parents but I feel like formal clothes are cumbersome to pack. Would they turn a man away if he wore a dress shirt with no jacket?   


Side question about food: can I go to Alfredo‚Äôs and the buffet for the same meal? Just in case my parents don‚Äôt like the food at Alfredo‚Äôs (they don‚Äôt like cheese but I love pizza), I want to make sure they get enough to eat and the buffet seems easy. 

Is food at the main dining rooms (the ones that are included but have a menu) better than the food at the buffet? 

Also, does anywhere on the ship serve macarons?

What is the most comfortable (soft cushioning) place for me to lie down all day, outside of my cabin?   
In some videos, I noticed these indoor seats with spherical looking covers, sort of like a coconut where a quarter of it was carved out. I think that might be nice and private.

Cruise,"Hello everyone. As I type this I‚Äôm sitting on the wonderful balcony hammock on Valiant Lady of Virgin Voyages, listening to the sounds of the waves, alcoholic drink in my hand, you would think I would be happy right? WRONG. Let me take you back in time to when this first started. 

Saga 1: in September 2022 I booked a virgin cruise near Christmas for December 2022. I then looked up flights and noticed they were a lot more expensive around Christmas (should have thought of that earlier but I was excited for the cruise okay). So I called virgin to rebook, as you can change your cruise up to 45 days before your sailing or cancel for a full refund from 7 days after you book (this is important later). So I can to reschedule our booking for January 2023, and it was super easy. HA WRONG. I end up calling multiple times, waiting for hours, using the call back button but never getting a call back, using their online chat service but it would just kick me off without ever speaking to someone. FINALLY I get ahold of someone, and I‚Äôm so frustrated I just want to cancel my cruise. Well it took so long for someone to call me back that it had already passed the 7 days for a refund, in fact I was on day 8, just short one day. I asked to speak to a supervisor (I know, Karen move, please don‚Äôt hate me) to ask since it took so long to get ahold of can I have a refund as it was not my fault. They said, sure benevolentbluecat, we value our customers, sorry for all the trouble you‚Äôve had, and here‚Äôs your money back. HAAAAA WRROOONNNGGGG. They said they didn‚Äôt have records of me calling, even though I had the phone calls in my phone probably at least 7 times or more, and that the chat on their website was my internets fault, even though I tried on my home network and my work one. So the supervisor ended up canceling my reservation as we were speaking, even though I never said to cancel because I did not want to lose my money. I decided to keep it because at least my husband and I would still get to go on a cruise. She then rebooked our cruise over the phone for the one in January. And that was the happy ending. 

WRONG. 

Saga 2: I call back 12/24/2022 to add the ‚Äúsplash of romance package‚Äù to our booking, and because there was a promo when we booked in September that they would add an extra 100 dollars to your booking at the time, but of course because it‚Äôs fucking virgin, I didn‚Äôt see it on the booking. I called, and someone answers the phone right away (SHOCKING) and I ask about the promo to make sure we got it. He says ‚Äúnope don‚Äôt see 100 dollars anywhere, fuck you‚Äù (didn‚Äôt actually say that but that‚Äôs how it sounded in my head but might as well) and said there is nothing that they can do. He does say we can add a free bottle of wine on board (again important) in place of the extra 100 dollars. My husband was with me when I spoke with him so I know I wasn‚Äôt going crazy, and I looked at him, and he said that was fine and to calm down Karen and that the bottle of wine was good enough (it‚Äôs why I married him, he‚Äôs the better part of me). So I say okay bottle of wine will do. And then we got our bottle of wine and had a great cruise. 

WRONG. 

Saga 3: We get on the boat. No bottle of wine. We go to sailor services, asking about it. The lady looks at me like I‚Äôm a Karen explaining my story. Y‚Äôall I promise I‚Äôm really not! If it wasn‚Äôt for my husband I probably would be, but anyway. So she says they will message the Miami office about the bottle of wine because the don‚Äôt see it on our booking. Miami responds, nope we don‚Äôt see anything. We‚Äôre on the cruise, and want to enjoy our vacation, so I almost dropped it. But then she says ‚ÄúMiami said that you contacted NUMEROUS times about this issue and this is your first cruise, so please stop requesting this‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm. Sorry. WHAT. 

Numerous times?? I contacted them once about the extra 100 dollar promo on 12/24, and once literally that day. They were making me out to be a crazy insane person contacting them multiple time about this same issue. So my husband and I send messages to sailor services and say that we would like the Miami office to listen to the recording from 12/24, and I know he promised us a free bottle of wine. They get back with us and apologize, that yes he did and here‚Äôs a free bottle of wine. You know where this is going‚Ä¶.

WRONG.
They said they listened to the tape and nothing was promised. Folks, this is where I need your help. What should my next move be? I know what was said, and thank god my husband was with me so we had 2 people that heard it. I don‚Äôt want to be called a liar. My husband thinks we should just leave it alone, but the Karen rage is building up inside of me and I don‚Äôt know if I can hold it back. They did give us a 100 dollar bottle of brut from sailor services that said ‚ÄúI hope this makes your stay a little better‚Äù but no apology or admitting what was really said. Can I request the recording? Can I ask them to listen to it again? Help!

Cruise,"My wife and I took a HAL Kongingsdam on an Alaskan Cruise from 17-24 September from Vancouver. On the cruise we decided to have some formal pictures done a man Connel, who inferred he worked for Joe Craig Black Label photography. 

We sat for the pictures and place an order which came to $1200 USD. We were given a receipt and  told that the pictures would be shipped to us within 10 weeks of the end of the cruise.

The ten weeks passed and no pictures. I contacted the only contact info on the package we had it was to [photography@HAGroup.com](mailto:photography@HAGroup.com) and never received a response.

I then contacted my credit card company and Holland America Customer service as I believed I was scammed. Both organizations opened up a case file.

I scoured the internet looking for the Joe Craig Black Label photography in hopes we could sort it out. I found the company in Australia and emailed them and asked about our photos. This is the response I received:

I just wanted to know if I actually can have fun on a cruise other than hanging around my family who certainly would want some alone time too. I mean, is it easy meeting new people, flirting with girls at the same age, partying and stuff like that, or is everyone on a trip like that usually travelling with their spouse?

Room service - is it true you can get room service included in this package - just pay gratuity?

How does it really work with toddler in bedroom and  one parent coming back late at night? Should I bring a curtain with me to pull across the room?  (seen it somewhere before).

Cruise," Hi everyone! I hope this is allowed ‚Äì I just got off a 7 night Caribbean cruise on the Norwegian Bliss, and I thought I would give you all a trip report!

This was mine (39F) and my husband‚Äôs (46M) second-ever cruise together. We were on a 7-night Canada and New England cruise in October on the NCL Breakaway, which we both really enjoyed. About us: we live in Pennsylvania, we like to eat, scuba dive, and hike. I like to drink, but my husband rarely has more than one at a time.

For this cruise, we‚Äôd booked a balcony room and gotten NCL‚Äôs Free at Sea offers, so we had 2 specialty dining meals apiece, plus the unlimited drinks package. We did bid on a few room upgrades and found out shortly before the cruise that we had gotten an upgrade to a Spa balcony cabin ‚Äì we wound up in room 15866. We liked the stateroom ‚Äì it felt decently spacious and had good storage. Because of the location of our room, the balcony was angled and slightly larger than the one we had on the Breakaway. On the Breakaway, we had a Spa mini-suite, and the main difference between the two rooms was that the mini-suite bathroom was larger, with double sinks and a bigger shower. We liked the location of our room on the Bliss ‚Äì it was right by the aft staircase, so we could easily run up one deck and be at the spa. We wound up paying $600 extra for the upgrade, which we considered worthwhile for access to the thermal suite.

We got on the ship in Miami slightly before noon on 12/31. Our cabin wasn‚Äôt ready yet, so we headed to the buffet and got to know the lay of the land on the ship. That wasn‚Äôt too tough, as the Bliss is a Breakaway-plus class vessel and thus was pretty similar to the Breakaway in its layout. We decided to stop in to book a spa appointment. They were offering an extra free 25 minutes on certain services on the departure day, so we got a couple‚Äôs massage appointment for 5 PM that day ‚Äì 75 minutes for the price of 50. By the time we had it booked, our cabin was ready (although our luggage had yet to be delivered). We had intentionally packed our bathing suits in our carry-on luggage, so we put those on and headed up to the thermal suite to relax before our massage.

We quite liked the thermal suite. Again, it was similar to the Breakaway‚Äôs, but a little bit larger. It also had a snow room (basically a big freezer) that I enjoyed using for a few minutes after turns in the sauna. We spent a lot of time on this cruise basking like lizards on the heated ceramic loungers! The thermal suite has a pool, hot tub, sauna, aromatherapy steam room, salt room, snow room, ceramic loungers, and regular cushioned loungers. It‚Äôs in the aft of deck 16, with the loungers arranged facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The massage we had was great, if verrrry pricey -- $499, plus an automatic 20% gratuity.

After the massage, we had a reservation at Le Bistro (our first specialty dining of two). I thought the beef tartare appetizer and the ile flottante dessert I had were both exceptional, but my scallop and shrimp entr√©e was only okay. My husband enjoyed his meal ‚Äì scallop starter, French onion soup, sea bass, and a chocolate dessert. The restaurant itself was romantic inside. We were seated at a window, but since it was after dark‚Ä¶. shrug.

We spent the rest of the evening wandering around the ship, grabbing drinks at various bars. We spent some time watching college football with a big group of Georgia fans, but we weren‚Äôt particularly invested in the game and so dipped in and out. I thought it was very cool that the ship had so many distinct bars with their own feel and menus. It definitely allowed us to feel like we were genuinely in different venues around the boat.

We went down to the ship‚Äôs atrium shortly before midnight, where there was a big crowd and live music. We counted down to midnight, waited for the balloons to drop from above, and were back in our stateroom by about 12:10 AM. (We‚Äôre old.) I thought this was a great way to do NYE ‚Äì we got to drink, ‚Äúgo out,‚Äù and celebrate‚Ä¶. without having to worry about driving or being on the roads. 10/10, highly recommend cruising on NYE.

Luckily the next day was a sea day, so we could sleep in. Before the cruise, we had bought passes to NCL‚Äôs Vibe Beach Club. This is a fee-only adult sun deck, and given that I‚Äôd heard that the NCL sun decks can be chaotic, I figured this was a good use of 250 bucks (‚Ä¶each). The area itself was nice and serene, with lots of padded loungers, a bar, and a hot tub. The staff were great, bringing drinks, fruit, and cold washcloths. We spent most of January 1 bouncing between Vibe and the thermal suite. We got dinner at Food Republic, a for-fee dining location that serves world cuisine. I had a sushi roll I loved and my husband really liked the street corn. We saw Jersey Boys after dinner ‚Äì I had no expectations going in but thought it was excellent. The talent on the ship overall was phenomenal.

The next day, January 2, we were in Roatan, Honduras. We‚Äôd booked a scuba excursion through NCL as the very first thing we did after booking the cruise ‚Äì diving in Roatan was a major reason we selected this itinerary. The diving was absolutely gorgeous and the excursion was mostly well-run. We had a shorter surface interval between the two tanks than I would have liked, and we were not directed back to our transportation at the end of excursion, which led to some confusion. Overall, though, I loved the diving and would absolutely do it again.

As we were getting back on the ship, I got a massive migraine, killing the rest of our day. Despite our plans to enjoy more thermal suite time after the dive and to see a comedy show that night, we spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in our blacked-out cabin.

January 3 was our day in Harvest Caye, which is Norwegian‚Äôs private island in Belize. We had breakfast at one of the ship‚Äôs small free sit-down venues (Taste and Savor). We‚Äôd tried breakfast at the buffet the day before and found the complete and utter chaos off-putting. The sit-down breakfast was much more relaxing. We got off the ship early (pre 8 AM) and spent about an hour strolling around the island. The beach and pool both seemed very nice, but despite it being a private island, the food and drinks are not included in the cruise fare, so we didn‚Äôt stay long. The highlight of the island for me was the little wildlife sanctuary NCL has. It seems so incongruous on a cruise line island, and they had scarlet macaws, toucans, and a little butterfly house. It‚Äôs a small area, but it‚Äôs cool free thing to do.

Back on the ship, we again spent the day alternating between lounging in the sun at Vibe, lounging on heated loungers in the spa, and lounging on chaises in the observation lounge. The observation lounge at the front of deck 15 is an amazing space. There was a small buffet of things like sandwiches and pastries out in the afternoons, a bar, and lots of seating. It was a great place to relax and just watch the ocean. One of my favorite spots on the ship. We had dinner at the ship‚Äôs buffet ‚Äì the quality of which I thought was surprisingly good. In particular, it had several Indian dishes (changing every night, and going well beyond the usual palak paneer and butter chicken) that made up the bulk of our dinners when we ate at the buffet. After dinner, we went to the theater to see the Beatles cover band. Neither of us are particular Beatles fans, but the show was a tight 45 minutes and they were incredibly talented. I was sad we never made it to a second show of theirs (they do three different shows a couple of times each). We again toured the various bars and spent a good bit of time walking along what NCL calls The Waterfront, a promenade on deck 8. It has the outdoor spaces for several of the bars and restaurants on deck 8 and is a great place to stroll after dinner. There‚Äôs lots of seating, and it never felt crowded. Another of my favorite spaces on the ship.

January 4 was a schedule change. The ship was supposed to sail north from Belize up the Yucatan coast to Costa Maya then to Cozumel, but for some reason that wasn‚Äôt explained, we sailed north to Cozumel first, then back south to Costa Maya. So January 4 wound up being in Cozumel instead of Costa Maya. I believe this change required us to leave Belize early (all aboard in Harvest Caye the day before was 2:30 PM) and we didn‚Äôt get off the ship in Cozumel until after 11 AM. We had booked an excursion with NCL to the Mayan ruins at Tulum, including a swim in a cenote.

Overall, we were glad we booked the excursion and felt like it was very well-organized. That said, getting from Cozumel to Tulum required a 45 minute ferry ride and an hour on a bus (this was made clear when we booked the excursion, to be fair ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt surprise us with it). And because our arrival in Cozumel was fairly late, we spent very little time actually, you know, excursioning. I would love to go back and spend half a day at the ruins in Tulum and another half a day in a cenote. The ruins were stunning.

We wound up being very glad we were on an official excursion, as a traffic jam got us back to the boat a solid hour after the stated all-aboard time. They waited for all of us, though! We were so exhausted and hungry at this point that we went directly to the buffet carrying our wet swimsuits and absolutely inhaled two huge plates of Indian food and a couple of the made-to-order crepes.

For our day in Costa Maya, we decided on the ship to book a beach club excursion. I‚Äôm not sad we did it, but I‚Äôd never do it again. The beach was nice enough, and the Caribbean sea was gorgeous, but the beach was packed with people. We were back on the ship in the afternoon and once again hung out at a combination of the observation lounge, Vibe, and the thermal suite until it was time to go see SIX. We‚Äôd already seen it on the Breakaway, but I thought it was so much fun I wanted to see it again. It was fantastic again. After the show, we went back to Food Republic so I could get that sushi roll again. Afterward, we stopped in at the District Brew House, the beer bar. There was a live piano player taking requests and encouraging singing along. Anthony was crazy talented and entertaining, and we wound up staying until midnight. It was an absolute blast and lowkey one of my favorite things we did.

The last day! It was a sea day, and you guessed it‚Ä¶ we hung out at Vibe, the observation lounge, and the thermal suite. It was seriously windy, so we didn‚Äôt wind up spending much time at Vibe, but it was an overall very lovely and relaxing way to end the cruise. We had our second free specialty meal at Q, the Bliss‚Äôs barbecue restaurant. It was much better than I expected it would be, and the quantity of food they served us was truly staggering. I had fried okra, brisket, and banana pudding, and I‚Äôd eat them all again in a heartbeat. The restaurant doubles as a live music venue, so we listened to a British band play American country music while we ate. We decided to spend our final night back at the District listening to Anthony play the piano again, and it was a perfect way to end the trip.

Overall, we had an amazing time. The food was mostly very good, the entertainment was fantastic, and the ship had a ton to do. I was glad we spent the money to access some less crowded parts of the ship ‚Äì the pool deck is not big enough, honestly, and was a total zoo on the sea days.

I am looking for suggestions for a first time traveler. I've never traveled outside of the US before and I was thinking about an Mediterranean cruise but it seems a bit overwhelming for me right now.

I am 29. No children.

I will also be traveling with someone who is on peritoneal dialysis so anything longer than 7-10 days wouldn't be ideal.

Ship size doesn't matter. 

I am not a partier or drinker, so a calmer environment would be nice BUT NOT a deal breaker. 

I am looking to be more off the ship than on hopefully.

Warmer the climate the better.

Food is not a deal breaker either, I'll eat almost anything.

Cruise,"My employer shuts down between Christmas and New Year's Day. I took advantage of that last month by taking a Christmas cruise out of Ft Lauderdale.  It's a tricky time to fly because (1) it's the holidays and (2) I'm on the west coast and might need a connection. I did luck out this time because I was able to change my flight from the 22nd (day before) to the 20th for no fee (and still getting a window seat, yay), thus missing the nasty weather that closed the airport shortly thereafter.

For Christmas 2023, I'm heading to Port Canaveral. Cruise date is the 23rd, which means flying in the day before = flying on the Friday before Christmas. Er, that sounds like a bad idea.

**Option 1:** Fly in a couple days early and chill out, which is what I did for Christmas 2022. Gotta pick a better hotel this time, maybe one that actually has USB ports or at least more functioning electrical outlets. 

**Option 2:** Book a short cruise which returns to PC on the 23rd, meaning I'll be flying in well before the holiday (but using more vacation time).

**Option 3:** Book a short cruise returning to Miami or Ft Lauderdale on the 22nd and then head up to PC for the night before boarding.

**Option 4:** Book on a non-stop on the 22nd and buy really good travel insurance.

Considering what I spent for 3 nights at the hotel plus meals, it would cost about the same or even a touch less to grab an inside cabin for a 3 or 4 night cruise. Plus, I'd be on a ship \*and\* would likely get to spend a day at one of the cruise line private islands. Option 3 has more possible cruise options but I'd need to either do a one-way car rental or hope the Brightline extension to Orlando is open by then, plus I'd need to either get back to MIA/FLL or book an open jaw flight for hopefully not too much more money.

Well, people tell you to just fly in the day before anyways. Which I do. Tell me why in suburban Florida you either have to (based on the Google review consensus) fear for your life and stay in a shack or pay $400 for one night in a hotel. Or pay $200 for one night and stay 35 minutes from the port by Uber. Every weekend it‚Äôs like this.

I'm Zlatko from Macedonia, a former cruise ship employee. Working on ships for five years was a wonderful experience, but in March 2020, the thing happened, and I was sent home with the rest of the crew. After a year and a half, in October 2021, I got an offer from the company to return to the ship, but trying to renew my medical documents, I was diagnosed with heart failure due to the virus. The condition is not naive, and unfortunately, I will never be able to pass a medical check-up and work on a cruise ship again. Because of that, I started working a seasonal job in Alaska at fish processing plants, where I didn't need to present medical documentation. Still, the job there is extreme, and my health condition is getting worse, so I decided to publish the diary I wrote on my first contract on ships.

Cruise,"We had a strange issue on a Princess cruise; it was our first cruise ever. I‚Äôm looking to see what, if anything, we should do next.

We had a wonderful cruise - we loved it. At one point towards the end, they asked for volunteers to give blood in a medical emergency. They whittled down the volunteers and my wife was selected to have labs done to verify her suitability to donate blood. Ultimately, she ended up giving blood to help another passenger. This experience was pretty unique and exciting.

Experienced cruisers with us predicted we‚Äôd get future cruise credit as thanks. We didn‚Äôt, which is fine and we didn‚Äôt expect.

However, when we checked our stateroom account, we had been billed several hundred dollars for donating blood. We explained to guest services and we were very casual about it - an obvious error. Guest services refused to to reverse it multiple times and told us we were simply confused and we must‚Äôve forgotten that we sought medical care. We insisted and explained, asked to talk to a manager, no luck. It got pretty argumentative. Particularly because we saw other passengers next to us getting drink chargers removed effortlessly and having their gratuity charges removed. Guest services said we couldn‚Äôt ask the medical center because they were closed and would be the remainder of the cruise (this was the last evening).

She told us there was nothing she could do and we‚Äôd just have to pay it, and to leave. We refused.

Finally, she said if we could prove we didn‚Äôt receive medical care she would reverse it. I said ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre charging me, you prove we received it‚Äù and she finally removed it.

I thought it‚Äôd be a funny little moment and a simple reversal; instead it was 30 minutes of arguing.

I explained this in my survey but haven‚Äôt heard back. I don‚Äôt fault the medical team for a simple human error, but I fault guest services for handling it so poorly.

Cruise,"My wife is taking a girl's trip in February and I had the thought to fly down with her to Miami and hop a weekend cruise (likely Carnival) and fly back with her on Monday. I've read a lot of posts about going on solo cruises, but I'm wondering how much I would enjoy it has a somewhat introverted person.

Essentially, I'm not the kind of person that's going to want to sit at a table with a bunch of strangers, I'm not going to hang around the bar and meet people, I'm not going to introduce myself to folks for trivia, that's just not my style. When I try to picture what my experience on the cruise would be like, it would basically be three straight days with my AirPods in if I'm not at the comedy club or a show. So I'd basically be paying for a lot of food and a handful of shows, solo trivia, maybe some time laying on the deck, maybe a massage, but that would be about it.

I'm not the kind of person to get off the boat, the cruise I took last time we did a couple of shore excursions to private beaches and I was miserable most of the time. People are loud, lots of people were smoking, I just put on noise canceling headphones and read on my Kindle.

Cruise,"An extremely honest review:

Onboarding/Off-boarding was pretty good. It was easy to get on and off the ship. Things do move a little quick so be sure to have your passport and IDs ready. We had to walk four floors of ramps and that can be a bit exhausting if you have a heavy bag with you. 

For Food/Drinks, I would recommend bringing your own snacks and sodas/juices (check cruise guidelines to be safe). When it came to dining in the main dining halls ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt too impressed. It was basic food and nothing to write home about. Though the servers were amazing, the food wasn‚Äôt and came in small portions. Everything needed some extra seasoning. But if you‚Äôre not used to three-course dining experiences, at least try it once. Just be prepared. In regards, to the windjammer‚Ä¶ I thought it was a little better than main dining because they had variety of food that you could pick from the bar. Breakfast was standard and same every morning. Each night had a different theme‚Äîfrom Indian to Jamaican. Some of the food was cold and we wish there was a variety of free drinks. They had a very sugar-loaded orange juice that I couldn‚Äôt finish. Also, it‚Äôs recommended to bring gloves because all of the non-washed hands touching the serving utensils was disgusting. Cocktails were extremely weak and watered down! Not worth the price you pay at the bars (with the high gratuity).

Specialty Dining ‚Äî Chef‚Äôs Table was EXQUISITE‚Ä¶all the food and wine had us feeling amazing. Everything was delicious and they took really good care of us ‚Äî pampering us like royalty. It‚Äôs highly recommended‚ÄîI would do this at least once per trip. Food spans from lobster salad to amazing soups to mind-blowing cocktails. The sliced scallops from Chef Eduardo and team was amazing and the filet mignon was perfect. It was also very fun to try different wine pairings with the different plates. And for Chops Grille, the customer service was excellent. The best thing on their menu was the truffle oil-infused mushroom soup and the warm chocolate cake. I would not recommend the red velvet ‚Äî did not taste like grandma‚Äôs‚Ä¶ tasted generic. Wine (Sauvignon Blanc) was good!

In terms of Customer Service, Agus (our cleaner) was amazing, polite, and always left fun towel animals on our bed. He catered to our every need, even providing pillows. Guest services and the attendants around the ship were great!!! But there were a few bad apples in the bunch to include a rude cyclist instructor who also sat in at the front desk at the spa. There was also rude workers at the cafe and ice cream stand who were very short with us. The cupcake decoration facilitator was really nice and warm.

Activities were not catered to people of color‚Ä¶ really focused on older white people and kids. I wish they had a designated lounge or club area that played solely hip-hop, r&amp;b, and soca. We enjoyed the cupcake decorating but could not do rock climbing because someone booked the entire thing. We wished they had more modern movies playing with diverse characters and themes. The flash mob and Zumba was really cheesy though some seemed to be really enjoying themselves. 

Quality of Ship - VERY OLD ship‚Ä¶ probably the oldest in their fleet and about to be sold off. Elevators were slow. Windows were obviously rusted with many maintenance marks, etc.

Cococay, Bahamas ‚Äî you could tell it was not an authentic Bahamanian island. It had NO authentic island food (e.g. conch fritters), the music was mediocre‚Ä¶ except for the pool party at the Oasis Lagoon. The exclusive beach club is worth it if you want to get away from the noise and all of the kids running around. The food was bad‚Ä¶not a surprise since it came straight off the ship. 

Overall, my experience was a 4 out of 5. I think if they remodeled the ship, upgraded the rooms and food/drink ‚Äî then this could definitely be a 5-star ship. Seeing the amazing stars and moon with my beloved was unforgettable. Captain was amazing and was hauling!

Ps. Stay safe ‚Äî only a few people wore masks and we even saw food servers sneezing into their hands and then proceeded to handle the food.

Cruise,"The FTC has started a 3 day period where they are attempting to collect complaints regarding hidden/deceptive fees. I have filed a complaint regarding the hidden fees charged by the cruise lines. The port, fees, taxes, and gratuities add a large amount to the cost of the cruise. Based on a sampling, the true prices were 19% to 106% higher than the advertised pricing.   


I'm not saying the hard-working crew doesn't serve these gratuities, they certainly do, but these fees should either be included in the cruise fare or disclosed more clearly when booking. While seasoned cruisers know and understand these, a first time cruiser will be shocked to see a $406 charge on the last day of the cruise. The only reason they're separate fees is so they can advertise deceptively low rates. 

The same goes for port fees. They're not included in the upfront rate, but account for a huge portion of the cost. Especially now that many cruise lines own the ports and get to set the port fees, they should be forced to include them in the upfront pricing. 

If you feel the same, you can leave your comments on the FTC page.

Cruise,"I booked a cruise on a certain cruiseline, a pretty new ship as well.

But reading the reviews, I started noting something strange. The 'Terrible' ratings (the first ones I want to read, because it might be an indicator I'd rather not have booked) had me wonder.

Here are some samples of complaints (written by couples in their 60s and 70s):

The TV had less channels than previous cruises.  The new televisions had only BBC MSNBC and Fox for news.  No CNN or PBS.  
Fitness center: Treadmills do not have TV's.  
Spa: Steam room has no timer.  Drinking water warm and not infused with lemon/lime.   
Alcohol:  Weak drinks.  
Food:  very small quantities for some items.  
No fruitbasket in the room like usual.   
Not everyday a chocolate in the evening.  
Due to weather the cruise was diverted from the Shetlands.  
Breakfast time ended at 10AM. That is just too early. They need to  extend their hours to 11AM especially with the amount of senior citizens  they have on board. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, might that be the reason? It looks like these elderly cruisers had their fair share of cruising, pre-covid, and have gotten used to how it 'ought to be'. Mind you, the company was known to be more catered for the elderly with a bit more to spend, but due to covid most cruises had to figure out what to do. So most of them, including this company, changed, catering more for a broader audience. 

Do these cruisers have some valid points as well? Well, yes. To be fair,  I left out the founded complaints, but the ones I stated are, in my opinion, pretty unfounded.

So, is this cruise terrible? I do not think so. There are praising reviews as well. We looked at the pictures, watched some videos and yeah, I don't think we will hate this coming trip.

I just hope there will be no moaning/complaining people, having issues with these kinds of rather petty tings.

Then, after waiting for several minutes when our luggage was ready, hundreds of people were funneled into another room with tables and narrow aisles where the luggage was stacked so you could barely get through. And once you finally go your luggage, you had to go back through the funnel and through the room you were just waiting in which has even more people in it now make the process take even longer.

We're thinking of seeing Norway via cruise ship this year, and I've got to be honest I'm bamboozled by the array of options, hidden costs, mealtime slots/dress code, drinks packages, on-spend packages, gratuities, etc, etc, etc. What about parking at port? No-one seems to even talk about that on their websites!

This is all before I made the mistake of reading about the environmental impact and ridiculous working conditions and contracts for the staff. Is it really as bad as I'm making it out, or is there a set formula for what to expect which isn't as bad as my brain is telling me?

For example, ""Pay ¬£X for the initial trip, expect to pay ¬£Y per day in hidden costs/gratuities (how are these even added...? When do you pay for them...?), expect to smash your head, elbows and knees every day in your room (I'm 6""3'), expect to rush off and rush on the boat if you want to see anything when docked and expect to have to dine with willy-waving 'I've been on 69765 cruises!' types every night."".

Sneaky the snail had always dreamed of being a part of something bigger. He lived a quiet life in the garden, but he longed for adventure. So, when he heard about a cruise ship that was setting sail, he knew he had to be a part of it.

The problem was, Sneaky knew that he was just a snail. He wasn't exactly the kind of creature that people wanted to eat. But he was determined to be a part of the cruise, no matter what.

Sneaky hatched a plan. He would sneak aboard the ship and disguise himself as a fancy French snail dish. He spent weeks practicing his French accent and perfecting his recipe. When the day of the cruise finally arrived, Sneaky was ready.

He managed to sneak aboard the ship unnoticed, and he made his way to the kitchen. There, he introduced himself to the chefs as ""Sneaky le Escargot,"" a renowned snail chef from France. The chefs were skeptical at first, but Sneaky's charm and persistence won them over.

Before long, Sneaky's snail dishes were the talk of the ship. Everyone wanted to try a taste of ""le escargot,"" and Sneaky was thrilled to be a part of something so special.

Cruise,"Hello all, just wanted to chime in on my recent experience with Princess.

This was my fourth cruise of the year, and my first ever with Princess.  I had gone with Carnival twice and Royal once prior during the year.  

My main expectation was that the food quality would be much better on Princess to the point that I would not need to even consider ""safety"" choices like I did on Carnival and Royal.  Thankfully on Carnival Guy's Burgers was always a reliable safety...on Royal there were no safety options and it mattered quite a bit.  

On Princess, as expected, the food was such that I did not need to consider a safety even once.  I was generally not hungry at all throughout my time on the ship and ate only to see what the ship had to offer.  Of particular note was the little things...that the chocolate chip cookies they served at every buffet meal had melted chocolate chips and a pitcher of milk right next to them.  Every meal was like this.  All of the other food was well seasoned.  There was a rotating selection of either medallion steaks or similarly sized lamb chops or pork tenderloin at every meal that typically had rosemary seasoning and was cooked to perfection.  

I've come to the conclusion that MDR food is about the same throughout most of the lines, at least up to the premium level.  I've been satisfied with every line save Royal, and the problem with Royal was with their app and chaos come reservation time and not really about the food.  The food between Carnival, Royal, and Princess at the MDR was the same high standard of a medium to upper class dining experience.  I don't expect Michelin star level experiences, nor do I expect a simple mom and pop diner.

This was thankfully the case because they canceled two port calls, one in Jamaica and the other in the Caymans, and so we ended up spending 8 out of 11 days at sea, with port calls during the middle of the cruise at Cartegena, Panama, and Costa Rica.  

Because of the long lengths at sea, I can also say that their movie selection is great, they had all of the top movies that came out in 2022 and some indie movies too like Nomadland (wow that was depressing).  I ended up spending a lot more time watching movies in my cabin than I expected because so much time was spent at sea.  

Generally not that important to me is the ship design, but again with so much time at sea it became noticable...IMHO the designs on mid-tier Carnival and Royal ships was much better than Princess.  The Princess main outer deck had too much plexiglass to the point that it detracted from the look, and the interior did not have the 10+ deck atriums that Carnival and Royal both employ.  Overall a minor detail.

I took advantage of the port expert they have on Princess...I found it quite informative and was looking forward to especially the Caymans only to have the best ports canceled...what a bummer.

Overall I needed a lot of R&amp;R and got exactly that during this cruise.  I felt incredibly well rested and well fed by the end of it.  The lack of ports for nearly a week both at the beginning and the end of the cruise dragged quite a bit, but other than that it was a great cruise and will likely lean more towards Princess in the future, especially if price is comparable.  I lucked out on this one, this was by far the cheapest cruise of the year for me, during Christmas and on a premium line.",Recent Christmas Cruise on Caribbean Princess,,CQME,,0,2023-01-06 03:53:28

Cruise,"&amp;#x200B;

1st time cruiser but was in the company of a few families that are frequent cruisers and NCL loyalists so keep that in mind when you read the below review.

Pros:

1. New ship with an elegant design. Muted colors and materials exuding high quality were used all over

2. Indulge food hall offering multiple cuisines was a great concept though it got a bit repetitive by day #4. Make sure to take advantage of any 'Free At Sea' promos to add premium dining options like Palomar, Onda or Cagney's or else the rest of the food is meh.

3. Entertainment  - Syd Normans band was fun; especially on their Fleetwood Mac tribute night. Noise Boys put on an enthusiastic performance and the Island Sounds group put on a short but nice performance of a few  Bob Marley  and Harry Belafonte covers

4. The Observation Lounge was a beautiful well designed space; one of our favorites to hang around in as a group or to just chill out in at the end of the day

5. The onboard staff was just incredible; very hardworking and yet always cheerful. Every member from housekeeping to the waitstaff at restaurants and the bartenders were working their butts off and yet always had a smile on their face and greeted everyone by name. 

6. Seating areas on the 'Ocean Boulevard' on deck 8 were nicely designed with comfortable loungers, wicker sofas and swing chairs spread out by (tiny) infinity pools.

7. NCL premium drink package was worth the upgrade through the 'Free At Sea' promos. All the bartenders provided excellent service which made the package all the more worthwhile.

8. Balcony cabins were modern and felt larger than equivalent ships.

9. Prima Theater was a good venue that converted to a Vegas style nightclub.

Cons

10. Some of the elevators were not operational leading to long waits

11.Other than Indulge, the free food options were just average. The Main Dining Room menu stayed the same and the buffet at Surfside cafe was pretty small. They really try to get you to spend on the premium dining options.

12. While the cast of Donna Summer was great, that production did not come together for me. Standup comedy could've been better. Shows billed as different shared the same material.

13. Trying to book dining or shows together with friends was extremely frustrating. Could not cancel show or speciality dinner reservations via the app so there was little to no availability to book shows and dinner reservations when many of the speciality had empty seats at the times we attempted to visit.

14. This ship felt crowded everywhere from the Penrose atrium to the (intimate =crowded) Syd Normans and of course all of the swimming pools.

15. The main swimming pool was tiny - surely, they could have carved out more room for the pool and surrounding deck. It got extremely crowded there.

16. The Prima Speedway was a bit underwhelming as a pure go karting experience. They kept throttling the speeds and it just wasn't as enjoyable. Many of the VR machines in Galaxy Pavilion were not working when we attempted to access them.

17. Port Of Call Issues - For our sailing, Cozumel was called on Christmas Day which was also a Sunday. Our local (non NCL) guide told us that Cozumel typically doesn‚Äôt receive ships on Sundays and most of the shops take the day off. Besides, it was Christmas Day which meant further closures. So, we felt that NCL could have planned that stop better. And to top it off, the bad weather we encountered on the island made the day worse but that was Mother Nature doing her thing. 

Also, we skipped 2 of the 4 port of calls (Grand Cayman and GSC). Yes, the weather was bad at those ports of call so tendering was not possible. However, Royal Caribbean‚Äôs Freedom Of The Seas arrived at the Coco Cay  at the same time as the Prima reached GSC and still managed to dock while the Prima was a sea day for us dye to the winds! Yes, RCL paid for dredging and building out the port. If NCL doesn't want to go that route, they should have backup plans to route their ships to an alternate port of call like say Nassau. The windy conditions at GSC were known well in advance. Skipping GSC seems to be a fairly frequent occurrence so NCL ought to have backup plans in place.",NCL Prima Review sailing of 12/23,,swiftaccord,,0,2023-01-05 21:41:37

Cruise,"Hi everyone,

I've been wanting to go on a cruise for many years after hearing stories from my parents when I was younger. My family and I are finally going on one in late February and we're super excited about it (I'm probably the most excited of the bunch). 

We're going on a 7 day cruise on Celebrity Reflection going to the Caribbean that sends us to the Bahamas, Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Mexico. In being a first time cruiser, I did a mistake of booking directly through the cruise line website and don't have a travel agent to help me.

In researching visa requirements to each country, I now find myself in need for someone's help or advice. I'm Canadian, so that's easy but my wife is Chinese so that's not as easy. Since she's a Canadian Permanent Resident (previously Landed immigrant), Bahamas, Jamaica and Mexico are fine; Grand Cayman (or Cayman Islands), I'm not so sure.

Their website is kind of all over the place so I'm not certain so hopefully someone has had my experience before and can confirm what I should do. From what I read, a Canadian (or USA) visa holder does not need a Visa if they are arriving directly from Canada or USA and leaving directly to Canada or USA. We are leaving for Fort Lauderdale but first go to Bahamas and Jamaica before docking in Grand Cayman.

If we have to get a Visa, we have to drive to Ottawa (about 2.5 hours from us) to go to a UK prefered provider and spend about 300$ CAD to get said Visa.

Has anyone had similar experience? If so, did you need to get a visa for a &lt;12 hour visit to Cayman Island?

They are offering reimbursement for the initial 7 days although it is no where close to the value that I think it should be.

Good: 
- buffet food is not bad
- price of the cruise is cheap
- brand new ship. This won‚Äôt last, as 1 month in and I could see a lot of wear and tear.

Bad:
- MSC did a fairly bad job at communicating last minute changes to their cruise terminal. It was supposed to be at terminal F, then changed to terminal D. Didn‚Äôt find out until we got to the port. This information should come through MSC.
- dining room crew seems poorly trained. Throwing utensils down, hitting people‚Äôs heads accidentally when they clean up. Blocking entire corridors in the buffet to have conversations with each other during rush hour.
- too many passengers. Elevators are inefficient. 
- onboard amenities is mediocre versus RCI, Carnival, NC. Other modern cruise ships offer more fun.
- internet package is tied to a single MAC address and can‚Äôt be changed.

The first 9days on the ship were great. Good food on in MDR (lamb chops, duck, lobster bisque, et Al). Elevators and pool were crowded but being a holiday cruise that was expected. However‚Ä¶..
We observed starting day 8 food in buffet tasted rancid. Fruits were not tasting good so we started eating in MDR. My husband had a Caesar salad on 31st in the MDR and came down with food poisoning. We are talking continuous vomiting and diarrhea. He was so weak I had to take him to medical center and they hooked him up to iv for 2hours. They tested and confirmed he got stomach infection. We missed out on going out to DR on 1st Jan and he was miserable.
On 1st Jan lunch my 18mo old had French fries (he ate fries and chicken nugget almost daily for lunch). After nap, he started vomiting 8 times and fainted. We took him to medical center and they tried to find his nerve 3 times for iv but could not. At this point they tested and confirmed he also got food poisoning and gave some pedialyte for him. We spent the last night miserable and worried for my son.
We got a bill for 3.9k for the treatment but I had trip insurance so hopefully it will be covered.

Cruise,"I'm currently aboard MSC Meraviglia, and the food is worse than my last cruise on the Seashore, which was, in turn, worse than my previous cruise on the Meraviglia.

The food -- both choice and quality -- is, to be blunt, terrible. 

For this cruise line to be successful long-term sailing from U.S. ports, it is going to have to adapt its menu more in line with American tastes. 

Foods I've seen on the buffet this week include  pasta salad with frankfurters, salmon pasta sauce that resembled lumpy Pepto-Bismol, shrimp pot pie, mussel pot pie, and many other dishes Americans just find strange at best and completely unappetizing at worst. The MDR dinner menu is, likewise, lacking in food appealing to American passengers. The food has been the talk of the ship this week, and not in a positive manner. 

I'm currently ""enjoying"" an Asian rice salad and trying to figure out whether it's the black olives, the red bell peppers, the white onion, or the sweet vinaigrette that makes it ""Asian."" I've decided it's simply the rice. Rice equals Asian, right?

On my previous MSC cruises, the consolation was that I could find one reliable meal a day at lunch in the MDR. Unfortunately, lunch had not been served in the dining room at all on this cruise. Is this a fluke or a fleet wide change? My cynical side imagines it's an attempt to push passengers toward paid options at lunch, in concert with the new $150+ unlimited specialty dining package. 

For now, this is most certainly my last MSC cruise. But I'm hoping the line can figure out the American palate and I can return someday.

Cruise,"Just got this email regarding our upcoming cruise in April.   I usually let the autopay while on the cruise but will likely prepay before 4/1 this time to save some $.  

I know the daily gratuity is a touchy subject on this forum.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion which I respect.   I am from the school of thought that the daily gratuity is for the hard working crew and should be considered as part of the cost of cruising.  Having the gratuities removed from your portfolio is not a cruise or system hack.  It affects the crew‚Äôs livelihood and also those of us who actually pay what is expected (The more cruisers opt out will lead to more increases to cover the shortfall)

Cruise,"I live in Miami and have been on ~15 cruises.. mostly RCL/Celebrity along with MSC and also tried Norwegian..

Never even considered Carnival with the image that it was the ""Walmart"" of cruises catering to rednecks/ghetto.. that was just my prejudice I've held forever- not sure why but the media reports of brawls and also look of older ships really threw me off..

FAST FORWARD- reviews of the Mardi Gras in 2021 got my interest as it looked modern and something more similar to RCL.. i ended up booking 7 nights on the brand new CELEBRATION for the New Years cruise with my family wife+ 2 small kids

WOW!! that's all I can say.. the best cruise ever.. they completely hit a home run with the design of the ship and overall package..  Food OMG A+ so many options/ included venues.. unbelievable.. everything spanking new.. so many shows/performances.. entire setup with the app makes it all perfect.. 

The real loser here is Royal Carribean because they are now way behind the curve. I was Oasis of the Seas last summer a ""amplified/renovated"" ship and it doesn't compare at all.. RCL Freedom of the Seas /Independence are the real ""Walmart of the Seas""

Carnivals new CELEBRATION/ Mardi Gras is a whole new level. I honestly felt the food including buffet/dining room was the best i had ever been seen- even superior to Celebrity Silhouette/Summit I've experienced .

Cruise,"This post is in case anyone here can benefit from my mistake.


&amp;nbsp;

**Short version**  

- Booked a cruise on the Princess website  
- At the scheduled time, Princess did not take any deposit off the credit card on file.
- Princess then cancelled the booking without any notification.  
- I had to call them and spend hours to get it re-booked.  


&amp;nbsp;

**Long Version**  

- Booked my first Caribbean cruise in late Nov. online using the Princess website.
- Booked flights separately
- Assumed that the mandatory deposits would be taken automatically off the credit card on file (just like airfare, hotels, etc.)  
- Carefully read all Princess confirmations/docs
- Contacted Princess the day after booking to ensure everything was in order.
- Was never advised I had to ""manually"" pay my deposits by calling them or using their website (which crashes a lot)
- During the busy holidays, never noticed the charges were not taken off the card.
- While reconfirming my cruise on the website 2 days ago, found out that my reservation was cancelled.
- No warning or notification was sent by email, text or call.
- Yesterday, called Princess and spoke to seven people.
- Here's how it went...  
&amp;nbsp; 

**Person 1 - Customer Service Agent**  

- I explain my situation.  
- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled but I have to call you back in 5 hours so that the right department can help you.""  
- No call back was ever received.  So after seven hours, I call them back.  

**Person 2 - Customer Service Agent**  

- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc.  Your reservation is cancelled.  Can I book you another cruise?""  
- I said yes, same cruise, same day.   
- Without explanation, they transfer me to to someone else.  

**Person 3 - Customer Service Agent**  

- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled. Can I book you another cruise?""  
- I said yes and finally expressed some frustration with the process. I said I want the same cruise booked and if not I would post about it on social media. I regret saying this because they replied:  
- ""Thank you for the threats.  Have a great day""  and hung up on me.  

**Person 4 - Customer Service Agent**  

- For fear of being hung up on again, I go back to a ""chill"" approach
- I asked to speak to a supervisor.  
- They still ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled. Can I book you another cruise?""  
- They then transfer me to a supervisor.  

**Person 5 - Supervisor**  

- They ask: ""What is your name, address, etc. Your reservation is cancelled. Can I book you another cruise?""  
- They say they can re-book me but they have to transfer me again.  
- Side note: I doubt this was a supervisor.  

**Person 6 - Customer Service Agent**  

- This person was the first person who showed empathy and projected confidence and skill.  
- Again, I had to provide all my information. (why they don't warm transfer, I don't know)
- This person quickly copied my booking and could book the same cruise for an additional $300.  
- I thanked this person for their expertise and tell them how happy I am.   
- I ask if I can get the same rate but they said I would need to speak with ""Guest Services""  
- They transfer me, but they also very kindly share their contact info with me for next time I call.  

**Person 7 - Guest Services/Customer Support**  

- When they answer, I ask if this is ""Guest Services"", but they said ""No this is Customer Support"".  
- This person was very cold but managed in about 2 min to simply re-instate my cancelled reservation and finally process my payment.  
- When I mention the original problem regarding the deposit, they simply said I should have made a deposit on their website.
- Then they ask: ""Anything else?""  
- I say thanks and have a nice day.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Conclusions:**  

- Next time, book with a travel agent.  
- I also had quite a few issues with both their website and medallion app.
- I don't have a super nice feeling about this cruise anymore.","Princess Cancelled Booking Without Warning (Newbie post, lengthy call centre summary)",,ReelDeadOne,,0,2023-01-03 17:11:09

One question I have is what percentage of passengers are Western compared to local cultures? Every culture has slightly different social behavior (as in Americans navigate a crowd very differently from Italians, that kind of thing), so I'm curious if you noticed any differences in how passengers acted. 


Butting up against that question, how different was the cruise itself from a European or Caribbean cruise? I'm perfectly happy being the only Western passenger on the ship, but it's a different story if all the announcements are in local languages and the entertainment and food specifically caters to local tastes.

I only just found out about this but Norwegian, Carnival and Royal Caribbean all offer onboard credits to shareholders.

Certainly worth looking into if you are an existing shareholder, not sure I'd advise buying shares just for the credits unless maybe you're young and plan on sailing with one line in the future.

I‚Äôve done all of the major lines before, a lot of cruising from a kid to a young adult.

But Virgin‚Ä¶is a class of its own. A world of difference that just feels good to be a part of.

Pros:
- no kids, or parents stressed about their kids, or ice cream running down the pool deck all day. It‚Äôs just blissful.

- vibe. They have areas for all people. You want chill? Hammock on your balcony. You want to get day drunk poolside? Shake your phone and champagne is inbound. Live music? Cool head down to on the rocks. House / pop music? Poolside or manor is your vibe.

- the guests. This was by FAR the best part. It‚Äôs literally like cherry picking the best people from other lines. There was almost zero ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù moments. Because it‚Äôs a premium line, most people are well off and worldly. There‚Äôs no judgement.

- the crew. They get paid like 3x the other lines, and are encouraged to be themselves. They swear, they dance, they enjoy each others company. And their tips are included, so they never are scrounging for more.

- the food. The galley is a league of its own for buffets. All the specialty‚Äôs minus test kitchen were absolutely incredible for cruise food. They don‚Äôt really batch much so it‚Äôs much more made to order food.

- the events. Scarlet night. I will leave it at that. BUT pro tip, bring something that you won‚Äôt mind getting wet.

Now to rephrase, ONE CONSIDERATION. First of all I‚Äôm all about people loving people. In whatever form that looks like. But if you are not comfortable with LGBTQ+ folks, stay away. There were men in thongs poolside twerking on each other. If this makes you uncomfortable, don‚Äôt go.

For me, there is no contest.

Pros:

- no kids, and because of that, no parents stressing over kids, the vibe is so incredibly different

- they have vibes for everyone, want to chill on your balcony and read a book? Here‚Äôs a hammock. Want to get day drunk at the pool? Have some champagne and comfiest day beds ever. House music at the pool, jazz music inside. 

- the spaces. Everything just feels ‚Äúgood‚Äù like nothing is cheap. Dinner chairs, lounge chairs, bar stools, glassware, it‚Äôs all just high quality 

- the crew. Because they are allowed to be themselves (can swear, and really just not be ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù), they are so much fun to be around. Also the pay makes them not be scrounging for tips so much.

- the fellow travellers. This is a premium line for progressive folks. People are well off and well travelled. Met some of the best people ever.

Cruise,"I've been on both and have thoughts and questions.  

Thoughts regarding food: Breakfast buffet was superior on NCL. Celebrity had more options, but the overall taste was better on NCL. Lunch was an even wash between the two. Dinner had Celebrity winning hands down. To the extent that if I take another NCL cruise I will make it a point to eat at only the specialty restaurants as the MDR was meh at best.

Shows/entertainment: I found to be equal on both ships. Both had amazing shows and an abundance of trivia/other entertainment. NCL had a much louder DJ by the pool, to its detriment, but had better nightlife.

Service: Here Celebrity wins hands down. The bar at NCL was always packed and there were never enough poolside attendants. The ""anytime"" dining also had the service pretty terrible at dinner as well. Stateroom attendants were both wonderful.

My question: Is the service on NCL that I experienced normal? The NCL cruise I was on was a 3 night fully booked while Celebrity was a 5 night at half capacity. Would I expect similar service had Celebrity been fully booked as well? I'm tempted to book NCL for a longer cruise, pay extra for specialty dining, and see if what I experienced was a one off, but if it's standard I'm going to be pretty ticked off. I like the ship options better on NCL, which is why I'm considering them again. But hubby and I are in our 40's and service is a pretty big deal for us.

Cruise,"So in Oct/Nov time I did a back to back Mexico cruise 12 days total all in Haven on NCL Bliss. I only did it as I scored a significant discount from being a rated player with Casinos at Sea. 

The room I had was a forward penthouse suite which which is in the VERY front of the ship. There in the corners up front. The other set of Haven rooms they have are in the actual Haven area. My room was on the 10th floor. Haven facilities are actually on the 17th floor if I remember correctly. 

So did I like it..yes and no. Room was huge. Separate living room, dining room area (small), full sized king bed and a TON of storage area. Bathroom was enormous. I also go to Vegas often and would equate the feel to a small mini suite if I was in Vegas. 

The room itself had a butler assigned but its not your personal butler she/he is assigned to many rooms but always available. 

So the issue I had was I rarely used the actual Haven area. I would have to walk 1/4 the way down the ship and catch the elevator up. The times I did I did check it out and had several meals there. 

The Haven area itself has its own bar and bartender that. A ton of seating like its a lounge. The pool in it there is a retractable roof and you can also go outside where they have there own deck area. There is a Vape/Smoking area up there as well. 

The dining was superb and faster then most fast food in my opinion. Whatever I ordered it was like instantly served. The part I did not like is 15 people asking me if I needed anything which happened every meal. Ended up not eating their anymore due to that. 

Never used the pool area but I could see how it was nice. Its quite. 

There own part of the observation deck is nice. Very quite. 

I get comped rooms in Vegas and NCL but I am not into being treated frilly wise. Very very easy customer to deal with. When the Haven people saw me they were suprised to see me lol. Thats how infrequently I used their facilities. I'm a low key person. I do not equate the high life being catered on in the least. 

Internet sucked and sucked badly. I would not even ponder paying NCL Bliss if I went on that boat again one cent for internet. The only time I could use my work computer to remote in was when I would hot spot my puck to the local Mexican 4g network. 

So some of the frills of being Haven is check in. They take you right up instantly about with no wait. Disembarking for excursions or what not is a elevator in Haven area that takes you right to the exit and your off first. Making any reservations for spa, food they handle it all.

So I decided to call NCL and ask why it looks like we paid so much more for the cruise, when it's being discounted a lot online.

2) is there anywhere we can get ice to take to our room (like one of the restaurants?) to chill the drinks? Do we have to bring our own wine glasses?

3) How do you settle your bill? I hear everything is in US prices but it's better to be billed in USD instead of letting them convert it to your local currency because the conversion rate sucks. How does it work though? Do I just manually settle the bill on the last day and that's when I tell them to bill me in USD? Or do they just automatically deduct my credit card? 

4) I hear that there are theme nights where we can all dress up - both in costume and formally. How do we find out about these so we know what to dress up as?",A few questions about Royal Caribrean cruise,,your-lost-elephant,,0,2022-12-28 13:14:48

Cruise,"I recently took my first cruise with NCL on the pride of America for the entire island Hawaii cruise over Thanksgiving. This is I believe my 18th cruise, have sailed on carnival and RCCL pretty evenly.

My friend that I traveled with has sailed several times with Norwegian and she did say everything that she read said that this ship was the worst in their fleet.

Long story short, we had some good times but also some very disappointing times such as our stop to Kawai getting canceled because of wind even though every other island was windy as well.

So when I received the follow up email after the cruise I filled the survey out and actually had to attach a document because my comments were so long it would not fit in the comment box. And I received an email today in response and I think this email alone would convince me to give Norwegian another try. Not only did they apologize for several things, they also took the time to acknowledge each and every item that I pointed out from a very disappointing and somewhat misleading shore excursion to the mediocre food and service in the dining room and the overall experience. 

They put a $50 credit on both mine and my friends account so on a future cruise we will get $50 off which is really nothing in the grand scheme of things but still a nice gesture. They also refunded both of us 50% for our disappointing shore excursion which was close to $250 Per person. I think their response and those actions alone would get me to consider them for a future cruise however I wasn‚Äôt really impressed with all the ‚Äúfree‚Äú at Sea when we still had to pay service charges and gratuities etc. However we were able to cancel our beverage package the first day since we hadn‚Äôt used it yet so we got money back there as well because especially in Hawaii when you‚Äôre on an island every day for most of the day unless you were doing quite a bit of drinking in the evening at dinner you‚Äôre really not getting your moneys worth (although this is coming from someone who rarely drinks so multiple beers or glasses of wine or cocktails would wreck me).",Use those feedback/survey emails!,,reb6,,0,2022-12-28 03:50:24

Cruise,"We (47m + 42f) did a week on P&amp;O Azura last week as a (relatively) cheap winter break.

We usually cruise with Royal Caribbean as we like the range of activities and entertainment. We  found that P&amp;O was a lot quieter and more formal. Possibly due to time of year, the majority of guests were senior citizens and quite reserved. The on-board activities were definitely aimed at an older crowd.

The stage shows were of a very high standard and the theatre was really good with some of the best stage sets that we've seen at sea. In addition to the production shows, there was an Adele tribute and a three-man vocal harmony group.

The ship is well designed with some very stylish interior design (a lot less brassy than Royal). We had booked an interior room, but were bumped to an ocean view, mid-ships on deck eight. Although the room was the same size as the interior room, the natural light and abundance of mirrors made it feel bigger. The room layout also maximised the available space.

There were signs of post-covid cost cutting in the lack of choices on the menus and the rooms only been made ip once per day. There were also quite a few stock shortages in the bars (no single malts available), which seems strange when most businesses have returned to normal. 

Overall, it was a nice cruise but we wouldn't be tempted to pick P&amp;O for our main vacation.",Obligatory sunset photos from last week's Canary Islands and Madeira cruise on P&amp;O Azura. Read the comments for a mini review.,,IGSketchUK,,0,2022-12-27 18:28:01
Cruise,"TL;DR version: Is Celebrity always this unfriendly to solos?

On paper, Celebrity is the perfect fit - my age, education level, income, and activity preferences all fit the demographics. After several cancellations due to you-know-what, I finally got onboard a Celebrity ship. And‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not impressed. 

To be fair, I‚Äôm on a Christmas cruise, specifically the Apex one to the western Caribbean. Holiday cruises are not typical and I did expect a certain level of chaos beyond what is normal. However, it‚Äôs not the kids or crowds that are the issue. It‚Äôs the service. 

I‚Äôm sailing solo as I always do. I‚Äôm in a cabin designed for solos, which is comfortable (albeit low on storage). But the cabin hadn‚Äôt been prepped properly - the fridge not been cleaned (ew, cheese cubes and soup?) or restocked, I didn‚Äôt get the famous Celebrity shopping tote, and FFS, the desk chair was missing.

While NCL crew is accustomed to solos, I also felt welcome on RC and Princess. Here on Apex, there is a noticeable difference between how the dining staff around the ship has treated me compared to adjacent tables. I‚Äôm grateful to Ritesh and Raj at Normandie for making me feel visible again last night.

Someone forgot to tell the Eden staff about the (only) scheduled solo gathering there. We eventually found each other without their help (which they didn‚Äôt offer anyway). 

I did submit comments via the guest services form. Someone called a few hours later to apologize for the painfully slow internet (which was just an offhand mention at the end of my survey) and upgrade me to premium. Not a word about my other concerns. So at least now I can watch YouTube to pass the time while being ignored? 

Apex is gorgeous. I‚Äôm chilling out in my usual spot in Eden. The food and live music are fab. Life isn‚Äôt bad - I mean, I‚Äôm on a cruise and these are very much first world problems. I‚Äôm already booked on what should be a more typical experience (on Solstice) because as I said, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to be representative. But good grief. I‚Äôm low maintenance and endlessly polite &amp; patient, but do I need to Karen it up to get service here? That isn‚Äôt an option. 

Since my company shuts down between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Day, it‚Äôs an opportunity to cruise without dipping into vacation time. I‚Äôm doing it again next year, but on NCL where I won‚Äôt be greeted by the waiter with ‚Äúoh‚Ä¶ I see.

We were recently on Oasis of the Seas. Last time we‚Äôd been to St Thomas, we‚Äôd docked at the West India Company dock, this time we docked at Crown Bay and totally threw off our plans for the day.

I was watching a YouTube video about people spending a month on a cruise ship and they had complained that if they‚Äôd known where one of their ports actually was, in relation to their intended destination, they‚Äôd probably have stayed on the ship. Which is similar to our experience in St Thomas. Someone on their chat said there was a site that provided all this info, but it was never specified.

Cruise,"I just sailed on the NCL Bliss (7-Day from Miami - Departed 12/17). This was my first time cruising with NCL, and as the title suggested, this will certainly be my last. These are just a few of the reasons why:

- The customer service was abysmal. The guest services line was always 15+ people deep. 
- I attempted to make reservations at some of the specialty dining restaurants on the first day of the cruise and was told that all but 2 of the restaurants were booked solid for the entire trip. The only ones with availability were Food Republic and Los Lobos (Mexican) and neither called my attention. I find it ridiculous that none of the other restaurants could accommodate us during the whole sailing (it‚Äôs not like I waited til the last day to reserve a spot!)
- The food in the main dining venues (Manhattan, Taste, Savor) was awful. I ate at those restaurants every day (since I couldn‚Äôt reserve a spot at the speciality dining spots), and I only recall one memorable dish the whole trip. The food always seemed to be cold (except for the salad - who doesn‚Äôt love warm lettuce?!), the waiters seemed to always mess up the order and the food lacked consistency from one day to the next. Also, the food always took an eternity! One night, dinner was literally 2 hours and 45 minutes long. If I was at any normal restaurant, I would have stormed off. Terrible. 
- I‚Äôve been on half a dozen cruises and I‚Äôve NEVER seen a cruise so crowded! I wasn‚Äôt able to get into the jacuzzis all cruise long because people were practically spilling out of them. The lines at the buffet were utter chaos. Good luck finding a pool chair if you‚Äôre not up by 7am. I wasnt able to secure a single seat at the comedy club venue the WHOLE cruise, and was only able to reserve a viewing of SIX (Jersey Boys was fully booked for all showings).
- The itinerary was changing without anyone being informed of the changes ahead of time. The switched the order of the ports of call and reduced the amount of time we had in each port. 
- Embarkation and disembarkation were both delayed for some reason with no explanation given. I was supposed to embark at 10:30am and didn‚Äôt get on the ship until 4pm.
- This company nickel and dimes you for everything! Everything is an added fee, additional cost, and they upsell you every chance they get. I received a voicemail on my phone every single day trying to get me to pre-book my next cruise with NCL. The audacity (given the circumstances). 
- The crew was clueless. Bless their hearts, some of them were lovely, but I couldn‚Äôt get a straight answer to a single question during my entire cruise. It‚Äôs like NCL doesn‚Äôt train their staff. I had a different waiter for dinner every night (despite going to the same main dining venues every day), no towel animals in the rooms, and I didn‚Äôt even learn the name of a single person on the ship, as no one introduced themselves. I recalled always receiving a warm greeting from my room attendant on both RC and Carnival; but on NCL, I don‚Äôt even think I ever saw the person who cleaned my room once. 

I can go on, but I think you‚Äôve gotten the gist by now. For context, I‚Äôve been on a total of 6 cruises before this one (3 with Royal, 3 with Carnival) and I‚Äôve always had a pleasant experience with both companies.

I will never cruise with NCL again, and I will tell all my friends to run for the hills if they even mention NCL in conversation.

Cruise,"I am a 40yo Canadian female that will be travelling solo. I've been on a few cruises in the past (RCCL x 3, Holland x 1) so know what to expect from a cruise - but have never been on one solo. I am looking at 7 day Caribbean end of Jan 2023 that aren't unreasonable for solo traveller (Holland, Celebrity, Princess don't seem to be good options) and don't go to places I've already been. 

I found 3 options.

1. RCCL - 7 Day Southern: Barbados (been before), Tobago, Trinidad, Grenada, St Vincent, Dominica, St. Lucia (been before), Barbados. I can get an Interior Room for \~ $1200 CAD, with no drink package, wifi, etc. I would need to book ASAP as it's a sale price. I don't know what the RCCL Drink Package and Wifi Pricing is to properly compare apples to apples but I can only assume it'll be closer to NCL pricing.
2. MSC - 7 Day: Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Netherlands Antilles, Antigua (been before) and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis. I can get a Premium Interior with Wifi &amp; drink package for \~ $1300 or a balcony for a bit more w/o Wifi &amp; Drinks.
3. NCL - 7 Day: San Juan Puerto Rico (been before), Oranjestad Aruba, Willemstad Cura√ßao, Kralendijk Bonaire, Castries St. Lucia (been before), Basseterre St Kitts, San Juan Puerto Rico. I can get a Solo Studio w/ access to Studio Lounge, Drink Package, Wifi, Speciality Dining and Excursion Discounts for \~$1500. 

With pricing being roughly comparable, room size, etc and I've read all the pros/cons of each of the lines, I think my decision is more around the ports. As you can see they are pretty different. 

A lot of the RCCL Ports don't have great reviews on cruise review websites. Have you been to any of these ports? What are some things you liked/didn't like?

* I want to feel safe as a solo female traveller
* I don't want to spend too much on excursions (NCL seems to have free? or at least $50 USD credit per excursion).
* I like seeing the parks, view points, hiking around vs walking the same ole cruise ship company owned shops or lying on the beach.

Cruise,"Overall great trip. Last sailed on Harmony out of Port Canaveral in March so most of my opinions compare it to that trip.

Port Miami is a MESS compared to Canaveral, but mostly expected that because it is Miami. 10:30 boarding ti.e so planned to get to port about 10 to allow time for parking etc.  Pulled up to tunnel and it was closed. Had to do a U-turn but between construction, Monday work traffic, and Google maps not letting me pick another route, we ended up back at the closed tunnel for a second U-turn. Third time tunnel was open and we got through extremely slowly. Plan for extra time here as traffic with 6 ships leaving and being downtown Miami made it a loooong wait for lots of folks sailing that day. 

Food was pretty good. Wind jammer was typically good, but very crowded especially for breakfast. We preferred MDR for breakfast  as wind jammer was just super crowded. Never felt crowded on Harmony over spring break, but enjoyed that layout for Windjammer over Freedom. 

Ate at MDR every night. Always good, no real bad dishes. Bread at table was just ok (why can't they have the pumpkin seed bread every night?!?!). Prime rib and tenderloin were excellent. Shrimp app was a bit disappointing with super small size shrimp and lackluster dip. Lentil soup was great. Desserts were always great, although creme brulee was a bit jello rather than smooth creme. Still flavor was great. 

Shows were really good. Ice show is an ice show, probably my least favorite of the trip but still worth a watch. Marquee was good, a bit long in the tooth for the song selection for my kids but it's an ode to classic Broadway so I get it. Once Upon A Time was better than Marquee. We all enjoyed it's more modern selection of songs somewhat related to old fairy tales. 

Highlight of shows was Mo5aic acapella group. They put in a fantastic show that we all enjoyed. They even joined the singer at the pub later that evening for more singing, taking requests, interacting with guests. Was a great night with those guys. 

Coco cay was great, even if wind limited snorkeling over at Chill Island.  We got to South Beach early and it was great. Calm waters a bit chilly, but definitely swimmable. Even as crowd from Chill Island made it's way over, it never felt too crowded. We skipped water park this time to enjoy the island. Kids would prefer the water park, but still thoroughly enjoyed South Beach and the free kids plays areas. Had snack shack for lunch and it was solid. Walked through buffet and kinda regretted not eating there as it looked really good. Ended up trying the Philly steak sandwich and it was pretty solid. 

Pool decks on board were very nice. Splashaway Bay for the kids was awesome compared to the tiny version on Harmony. Slides and flow rider were great, although a bit odd separate from the rest of the pool areas. Felt weird having to walk back and forth, but minor gripe. Really liked the enclosed stairs to the slides versus the open air stairs on Harmony. Can get very windy that high up!

Promenade was nice, but felt a bit cramped versus Harmony. Never really crowded perse, but if anything was going on in promenade, it definitely bottle necked things. Harmony just seemed to provide the extra elbow room with the wider promenade. 

Had an Ultra Spacious Ocean View room that was awesome. Was myself, wife, and 3 kids (14, 12, 9) and we were very comfortable. Had a little room with bunk beds for little 2 and the couch converted to bed for the 14 year olds still never felt cramped or in top of each other. We typically get connected balconies but this was often better and the extra floor space felt more like a normal hotel room. Decor ideas sna bit dated, but didn't hurt anything either. 

Seas were a bit rough most trip. Definitely felt the rocking especially overnight. Not sure if that is ship size or just luck with weather ( very windy everywhere). 

Nassau was Nassau. Headed to Margaritaville and really enjoyed it. Staff there was super friendly. Had access to their pools, water slides, rock climbing, flow rider, cliff jumping pool, and semi-private beach. Was definitely better than fighting crowds over in the public side. Getting there was terrible as always between the construction and the typical bombardment of various hawkers. Never fun for me!

Cruise,"So my wife and I are going on our first cruise coming up in January and we had a few questions.

1) I didn't see any meals listed as Formal Dining in our reservation on the Royal Caribbean app. Is there a certain day/meal that should be formal, or does our cruise NOT have a formal meal? Also, what is appropriate attire for male and female cruisers on Royal Caribbean cruises?

2) I noticed that two of the ports (Haiti and Jamaica) are considered Level 3/4 on the US State Departments website as places not to travel to. Are the Royal Caribbean ships still docking in those locations and if so, are we safe as long as we stay in the group for the excursions? If they DO cancel, I'm assuming they'll issue a refund for all excursions booked through their app. If so, how quickly does the refund process? 

3) For the cruise and excursions, should we take cash, traveller's cheques, or just use our debit and credit cards? Do they accept US currency on the islands or will we need to exchange it? Also, what should we tip for while on the ship and while in port?

4) Last one I can think of right now, if we didn't want to do any of the excursions, are we still able to just hang out at a beach for free or do some sightseeing/shopping in the town around the ship?

If there's any tips you might have for someone's first time, it would also be appreciated.

Cruise,"I just recently booked my 1st ever cruise for March 2023 going to the Caribbean. I was wondering if anyone could answer a few questions regarding this ship / cruise line!

*** I am in my mid 20s and aware this cruise line caters to a much older crowd usually.. I purposely selected this cruise line to try and have the most peaceful trip I could**

1) Can I bring wine on board? If so, how many bottles? Would there be a corkage fee if I were to have it in my cabin?

2) Can I bring sealed snacks on board?

3) How late is the casino open?

4) In the main dining room, is the food unlimited without extra cost?

5) Does housekeeping come to the rooms everyday?

6) Should I bring any cash?

7) Is the thermal spa pass worth it? What does it have to offer?

I noticed that selecting the free at sea open bar option while on the checkout screen for booking a stateroom they charge a $200 dollar gratuity fee.

I ended up booking WITHOUT the drink package, looking in the app it now costs $1177 to add it on. ($109x9days+20%gratuity)

Im having a hard time wrapping my head around this, can someone explain what the bill would look like if I had booked with the open bar in the beginning? Do they bill you for the $109 per day at the end of the cruise? or would you essentially be getting the $1177 package for only $200?

Cruise,"I booked a NCL cruise early October that‚Äôs 10 days out now. The first stop is Ocho Rios Jamaica. Unfortunately, I just saw a news article that came out yesterday about the travel advisory from the US state department warning travelers about the level 4 do not travel status to certain parts of the country. This included the parish Ocho Rios is in, more specifically Steer Town, which is where the majority of the excursions offered through the ship go.
I called the standard reservations desk regarding this yesterday, and the associate and manager couldn‚Äôt give me any reasoning as to why they are still going to this port. All they could say was that they deem it as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and they have supposedly ‚Äúreviewed everything.‚Äù
I was referred to their corporate office, who still wouldn‚Äôt give me any additional information as to how they arrive to the decision, contradicting what the US state department and other independent sources have arrived to.
The only additional preventative measure that they are providing as a safety precaution is potentially having a Norwegian cruise line employee join any excursion. They also brought up the fact that you will be in a group. Ultimately, they did not give any substantial reasoning to make me feel particularly safe.
The lady I was talking to also tried to tell me that they aren‚Äôt going to the area that has the travel advisory. I told her that is untrue, to which she seem to sort of backtrack her statement when I called her out on the lie with evidence. 
I asked if I can cancel my reservation for the entire cruise, as I don‚Äôt see as much value when I‚Äôm losing a port. At the same time, it feels like I‚Äôm taking a gamble with my life to get what I paid for. Unfortunately, they said I would face the cancellation penalty of the full amount, minus gratuities, and excursions.
I am just so surprised that the cruise line not only is ignoring a major governmental body‚Äôs guidelines, but cannot give any meaningful reasoning as to why they have elected to do so. There are surely plenty other ports they could go to‚Äîor perhaps just go to the next port on the route and stay there a couple days instead. Safety doesn‚Äôt seem to be a priority.

My latest cruise was to Nassau on Conquest. 

Here is what we experienced:
- We didn‚Äôt leave the port around 7:30 give or take. The reason why we couldn‚Äôt leave is because someone had a suitcase consisting of guns and drugs. I mean how in the hell does someone get guns past security. And what was this person planning? That is a very scary thought in crowded areas. 
- Our cabin was a few doors down from some rowdy cruisers. Now, I don‚Äôt mind rowdy cruisers generally speaking because I think it‚Äôs good to let loose and have some fun, but there are limits. While sitting in the balcony we started to smell some strong weed. So much so that we had to go inside the cabin and close the door. I called the front desk and told them about it, and they asked ‚Äúdid you see the person smoking?‚Äù  I said ‚Äúno‚Äù, but you should send someone up to the floor to investigate. Nothing was done.
- Same group seem to have brought on board some way to play some loud music from their cabin. 2am in the morning and we heard loud music. No respect for anyone when people are trying to sleep.

These 3 days are great to do a quick getaway , but man‚Ä¶they come with some warnings and buyer beware. Typically we‚Äôre playing Roulette for hours in the Casino and we‚Äôll do an excursion, which kinda shields us from the pool area where you hear about crazy stories.

Ironically enough, it's his absolute reverence and addiction to cruising that has completely soured the concept for my spouse and I, who have never been on one. I've never had anything against it really, but it never looked particularly interesting either. I'm also wary of anything anyone says is ""perfect for everyone"" because people are waaay too variable.

But I think my vague indifference and my husband's outright refusal is just egging him on like it's a challenge. He asks non-stop, tries to convince me to ""work on"" my husband behind his back (which pisses him off), won't take no for an answer. (I'll add that while they're civil, he and my husband haven't had the smoothest relationship and a cruise isn't going to change that). The subject of cruises has even been banned multiple times, but it doesn't last more than 5 minutes before talk about ""Ship X is going to Y"" or ""they have a huge mall"" or whatever.

Cruise," 

Just a few minutes ago there was an announcement of man overboard, port side. Before that were three long blasts of the electronic horn.

People began running to the sides to investigate, although it's night time. We're outside of Cuba heading back to port in Miami.

We have all just been instructed to return to our cabins.

Edit: A crew member came to our cabin and told us we had to close our balcony door and draw the blinds. I'm not sure why.

Edit 2: They just allowed us to leave our cabins.

Thanks to another redditor in the comments, we were more reliable informed that a passenger fell from his balcony and landed on deck 8 on the port side. They did not survive. Police will board tomorrow when we return to port to investigate.

From the post: ""We just had 3 emergency blasts at dinner, then the captain came on ‚ÄúMan overboard starboard side‚Äù. Many went to help look for him and saw something awful. Looked like a body on Deck 8. Unclear what happened but pray for his/her family. We were all sent to our cabins.¬†""

Edit 3: *FINAL UPDATE*

It is with a great deal of sadness that reliable updates have revealed what happened. It would appear as though a 15-year-old passenger was part of a disagreement with his family. He climbed the ledge of the first class deck, 16th level, called ""yacht club"", and fell to the 8th level deck, landing on his back. He did not survive.

Within seconds, a great deal of crew responded. The crew placed a tent over the individual in order to shield them from view of onlookers. Passengers were also instructed to return to their cabin, and close the balcony doors and blinds. After a short time, the majority of the attending crew left the body and placed it under guard until the morning. The medical examiner arrived around 10:00 a.m. once at the port of Miami. The ship was instructed to leave the body undisturbed until the medical examiner arrived.

At last report, the Miami Police were said to be investigating the event as a suicide and reports from alleged family members and acquaintances have confirmed the same.

I only offer my deepest condolence to the family, And hope that I have remained sensitive while also trying to inform the community, mostly those who are on the ship at the time.

Cruise,"Hi there,

So I'm 15 years old and about to go on my third cruise, which will be with MSC for the first time. This is the first time which we're cruising on any line other than Royal. On the two cruises which I have been on with Royal so far, thanks to the teen club I enjoyed my holidays much more than I would've without it, and made some friends who I still keep in contact with today. Anyway, on Royal's website, before I went on my first cruise, I read that the teen club was split into ages 12-14 and 15-17, and I was worried about meeting people younger than me, as I was afraid that I basically wouldn't get along with people younger than me. Despite this, when I turned up, it wasn't split up at all, and all my worries were for nothing. Now I'm worried about the opposite happening. I'm worried that the teen club on MSC is split up (12-14 &amp; 15-17), and I'm worried that I won't be able to get along with people who are older than me, and that there won't be many or any other people my age. This is as on my most recent cruise (Wonder OTS), I was lucky enough to make some friends, who were my age, but since then, I've turned 15. This worries me because the friend group of older kids which seemed to have been made just seemed like they were jerks, and I'm worried that because the teen club on MSC is split up, and I'll be put into the older group, the people who are there will also be jerks, and I'll basically end up having no friends, which I don't want. Also, me and my cousins are thinking about going on their first cruise next year, and despite the fact that we're in the same year for school, they would be 14 and I would be 15 at the time, and we're worried about being split up. 

So if anyone here has been to the teen club onboard any MSC ship, was it separated between ages, is it very different to Royal (do they have daily activities and an icebreaker session and stuff), and were there many people there who were the same age as you?

1. Hit: The seasonal decor! Halls were decked out nice and jolly on the Liberty, with cute touches like garlands everywhere you looked and a giant Christmas tree in the main atrium, complete with a mailbox to leave letters to Santa. It was beginning to look a lot like Christmas for sure.  


2. Miss: Festive Foods. Basically, there weren't any. I have heard of MDR menus offering special meals on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day sailings, so maybe we just weren't close enough to the actual holidays -- but there was nothing at all being offered on ours. MDR menu was business as usual. No big deal, but it would've been nice to see a holiday-specific entree or two, or maybe a dessert.  


3. Miss: Holiday Drinks. So, like the food, there basically weren't any. At least not that I could see, even though I did NOT try every single bar (so someone please correct me if I missed them). To me, this is a huge missed opportunity. I was on a Carnival Halloween sailing last year offering beverages like Patch's Punch and the Monster Mash - so it seems like it would be pretty easy to extend this into the Winter holiday season. I mean... Dr. Seus's Green Eggnog? Cranberry Island Spritzers? Hot Buttered Caribbean Rum... the drink menus write themselves, Carnival.¬†  


4. Big Hit: The Holiday Show.¬† I wasn't expecting very much from this, and in fact, hadn't even known it would be offered at all.¬† Much to my wondering eyes, though, Carnival put on a great little holiday show featuring the truly AWESOME Adam, our cruise director, and many of the kids from Club Ocean actually IN the show and performing!¬† I couldn't help but think how cool an experience that must've been for them. Someone special makes an appearance -- I'll give you a hint, he's big and green, and his heart grows three sizes when he gets on a boat.¬† Yes, it was meeeeee! I kid...  


5. Hit: The other passengers!¬† They were festive AF, y'all.¬† I saw many doors decorated and many people dressed in Christmas-y outfits.¬† Santa hats and sparkles galore, these were some jolly little cruise elves.¬† It really did feel like something special was afoot.¬†¬†  


6. Hit: The music!¬† While it wasn't constant, and that's probably a good thing, there was a nice selection of holiday music being played throughout the ship.¬† You had your typical versions of Christmas songs, plus some rock-ish stuff playing all over the place, even on pool decks.¬† ¬†¬†  


7. Miss: Representation, or lack thereof.¬† Ok, to be fair, there WAS a giant menorah in the atrium, so that's something.¬† But, other than that, Christmas was pretty much the only winter holiday you're going to see represented at all on the Carnival Liberty.¬†¬†

Cruise,"Hello!  I'm booking an Alaskan cruise as a present for my parents (58/60) + sister (13) next summer and want to get some feedback from the experts.

Background: my and my family's only past experience cruising has been going to the Bahamas on Carnival more than ten years back. It was fun and all but for this trip I'm hoping for a more subdued experience focusing on experiencing the destination and scenary and avoid the rowdiness esp with my sister at an impressionable age. My parents have wanted to go to Alaska for a while and this would be my big treat for their bucket list. 

What I found: HAL Volendam round trip from Vancouver, BC first week of June with destinations in Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Icy Strait, and Glacier Bay.

From researching it seems like people all highly recommend glacier bay and getting a balcony room. I'm looking at the Vista Suite with a Balcony for around $4K for all three including fees. I do like that it seems a good amount bigger than standard rooms at almost 300ft.

Overall does this seem like a decently priced booking?

Add-ons: I have the option for paying $800ish more for the ""have it all"" package that includes besides the normal stuff I think $200 OBC. 

My parents aren't big drinkers - maybe a beer/glass of wine at dinner and some fancy coffee here and there. My sister will probably love the mocktails. They wouldn't care much about specialty dining. Only thing they probably care about is the wifi probably.

So all in all the ""have it all"" is $400 after accounting for the $200 OBC + 2x $100/person excursion credit. The difference is $400 but I don't see the math working out. Anything I'm not considering here?

Excursions:

I'm thinking the following:

Juneau: combo whale watching / glacier boat tour

Skagway: Scenic railroad tour to Yukon + stops (looks to be a full 8hr day)

Icy strait: this is listed as a 1/2 hour service stop? Would they actually get to get off the boat? I figure they can walk around and explore nearby area on port.

Ketchikan: Lumberjack show maybe (or should they just do this in Vancouver area?) + Tram up the mountain and some easy hiking trail.

Would love to hear feedbacks and thoughts on the general plan, thanks!",Evaluare this HAL Alaskan Cruise Booking,,xombie-love,,0,2022-12-17 23:01:30

Cruise,"I will embark on a 14 day MSC cruise from Guadeloupe on Sunday. At the time of booking, the best category available was the fantastica experience. So we booked this and bid on upgrade for an Aurea and yacht club room. 

We had already lost hope that our bid would get accepted, until I got charged 2630 USD on my card yesterday. I compared the amount with the upgrades I bid on and it must be a balcony cabin with a hot tub. The only issue now is that I didn't receive a mail nor does MSC know what happened.

When I first saw the charge from MSC, but no mail I assumed it would just take some time to process the upgrade (remember this is 72 hours before the cruise). So I waited until today (48 hours before the start of the cruise) until I called MSC. Here the fun begins.


1. Call ended by the line getting disconnected after I told the customer respresentative that I bid on and upgrade. Technical error? - call duration 5 minutes

2. Call ended with the customer support asking me to reply to the original mail from bid upgrade. Did that and the mail came back with user not found - call duration 15 minutes

3. Call customer representative understands me and says she will give me the correct phone number (which I think does not exist). I call that number and they tell me they do not deal with end users at all and that I have to call the hotline. - call duration 20 minutes (and some 20+ with the wrong phone number I was given)

4. Call... This time I will not give up. The poor guy on the other side talks to his (useless?) Supervisor for about 45 minutes back and forth, but they still can't figure out what is going on. He asks me to send mails again (did that same result, user not found), call my credit card company (not sure how amex will help me, but ok) and finally gave up and said I just have to hope that I get the upgrade or my money back. - call duration 65 minutes


So as of now, MSC has charged me for an upgrade I didn't get, but they also have no idea why or where the money went. Sounds like they have a lot of operational issues!

3. Interior on Celebrity Reflection to Bahamas 

Need to decide fast while offers are valid so can anyone provide insight on the following questions: 

1. What‚Äôs it like having a Havana Cabanas and did you think it was worth the extra cost? 

2. What is the vibe of Celebrity cruises like compared to Carnival? What activities does Celebrity have compared to Carnival? 

3. Has anyone tried the Cloud 9 Spa at Carnival and do you think it is worth the up charge to get a Spa cabin particularly in cold climate itineraries? 

4. f I choose Carnival Venezia, what is there to do or see without doing excursions? Excursions for that cruise are more expensive so I want to know if it‚Äôs feasible to do all self excursions for that itinerary. 

Some things to consider:

-I did do the Panorama already and have considered doing that cruise again but with a Havana Cabana. Or I can hold off on that and do it for my 30th birthday because of the hefty premium. On the other hand I also live an hour away from Long Beach so it costs the cost of flights and hotels before the trip. 

-I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and am the extroverted type which is why I enjoy Carnival and it‚Äôs games and activities but have heard that Celebrity is for a older crowd and may not have an upbeat atmosphere. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit immature for Celebrity cruises but I could step out of my Carnival comfort zone‚Ä¶.",Picking another future cruise,,Life-Satisfaction644,,0,2022-12-15 06:04:49

On Disney‚Äôs oldest Cruise ship, the Disney Magic, how do things stack up in 2022? We got the opportunity to go on the Disney Magic out of Galveston for their 7 Day Very Merrytime Cruise. With this being my 2nd Disney cruise, and our 21st since Cruising restarted in 2021, we have had a lot of great experiences on all kinds of ships, including Disney's newest ship the Disney Wish, part of their Triton Class of new ships, Carnival's Mardi Gras, RCC'S Wonder of the Seas and both of Virgin Voyages ships.

Food- If you haven‚Äôt been on a Disney Cruise yet, then expect some of the best food you will ever have. Unlike most cruise lines there is no main dining room, each night you rotate between 3 different restaurants. Lumiere‚Äôs, Animators Palate and Rapunzel‚Äôs Royal hall, with an early and late seating available, one at 6:15 and one at 8:15. On a 7 day cruise that means you will eat at each place twice, and once in the middle of the cruise you will go to your first restaurant for pirate night and a pirate themed menu that is the same across all 3 restaurants. Every other day will have a completely different menu with no repeats. The buffet is available for breakfast and lunch and not available for dinner, unlike most cruise lines, however there are other things available on the Lido(top deck), the times for the buffet and restaurants during the day will vary slightly, but usually breakfast is around 8 and lunch around Noon. There are several quick eat types of places available when the buffet is closed, there‚Äôs pizza, soft serve ice cream, chicken strips, a sandwich and soup/salad place as well as shawarma and burgers at Donald‚Äôs Duck-in. All of which we found ourselves eating at least once a day at those quick eats places because we missed breakfast or lunch at the buffet/restaurants. There is also free room service available 24 hours a day by calling on the phone in your stateroom which we did order on a couple of occasions. Breakfast and Lunch hours in the buffet, Cabanas, usually runs 2 hours a day for each meal, for lunch you also have food at Rapunzels table and breakfast at Lumieres. On the final day of the cruise you have the option of having breakfast at your last dining room, which is also your first on a 7 day cruise. I found all of the food to be top notch, although there were some items I didn‚Äôt particularly love in the dining room, and a few items in the buffet I didn‚Äôt care for. At the quick eats places on the Lido deck I pretty much enjoyed everything including the burger of the day except for the pizza which was probably some of the lowest quality I have experienced on a cruise ship, the crust was more like pre-made cafeteria pizza, where every other cruise I have been on made the dough from scratch. We did share our dining table with two other new friends, and they did have a dietary restriction, which they pre-ordered all of their meals the day before, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so each of their meals were prepared specifically for them each day.

Shows- There are 3 different Broadway style shows on this 7 day cruise, there‚Äôs a retelling of Cinderella‚Äôs story, with a twist. There‚Äôs also A Rapunzel show and a Disney original that recaps a bunch of different Disney stories called Disney Dreams. They were all really great shows, Twice charmed was great for its original spin. Disney Dreams is full of nostalgia from some of their greatest hits of the 90s and 2000s, Like Aladdin, Lion King and Frozen. Rapunzel was the least original, being mostly a carbon copy of Disney‚Äôs Tangled, but still interesting how they tackle the live action horse Maximus. All together they are shows worth checking out, whether you are kids, have kids, or just Disney Adults enjoying a cruise, I would recommend everyone check out these shows, and if you don‚Äôt like them just come back later and tell me all about it. On top of the shows they do have live entertainment on 3 of the other nights. Our entertainers were a ventriloquist, Lynn Trefzger, a comedic percussionists duo, Bucket‚Äôs and Boards and a magician Jon Armstrong. Each one had a unique family oriented show that runs twice a night, opposite of the dinner schedules. So if you have the early dinner seating at 6:15, your show was at 8:15, and if you had the late dinner schedule, your show was at 6:15. There is also an adults only show every other night by each one of the performers, and they were worth showing up for each time. One night they did have a showing of Strange Worlds, a new Disney movie still out at the theater. At first I was recluctant to go to the ventriloquist show, Lynn Trefzger, but she was hilarious and delightful. The comedic percussion group Buckets and Boards was also a great duo, both funny and good musicians, they will entertain you during the entire run of their family and adult only shows. The magician was an equally good show, featuring the tiny plunger that defied all logic and I have yet to figure out how exactly the plunger knows which card is which. We didn‚Äôt manage to see his adult only show, but I‚Äôm confident it was just as good as the rest of the entertainers.

Entertainment- There is so much to do on a Disney cruise, if you have kids, no kids, or are kids, there is stuff to do pretty much round the clock besides the main shows that run twice a night, there is also a bunch of other types of entertainment. There is adult only entertainment happening in the club, Fathoms, each night, so don‚Äôt think that if you aren‚Äôt a kid or you don‚Äôt have kids you won‚Äôt have a good time. There is a dedicated theater running free movies, most of which are still out in the theaters themselves, running almost all the time. There are occasional free movies out on the open deck as well, usually family oriented showings. Being the Merrytime Cruise, there was also a bunch of holiday themed fun, including Santa and Mrs‚Äô Claus meet and great / photo opportunities. One of the things we have gotten on our Disney Cruises is the unlimited picture package, which is well worth it if you plan on buying any of their pictures. Along with the meet and greats, there are also nightly backdrops that change out each night and run during the evenings with their professional photographers. Shout out to Tommy, my favorite photographer who I just had to say ‚ÄúHi Tommy‚Äù every time I saw him, and without missing a beat he replied ‚ÄúHi Tommy‚Äù back. We took over 200 photos during the 7 day cruise, and about 139 on our 3 day Disney Wish cruise, which goes to show how much more in photo opportunities they have on the Wish vs their oldest ship, the Magic. That would be one of my complaints, after having been on the Wish, which is huge by comparison and has the benefit of Disney learning from every other ship they have built, is that there were far less photo opportunities on the older Disney Magic. There are kids clubs running all throughout the cruise, with lots and lots of activities to keep those kids busy. There were also some impromptu meet and greats throughout the cruise, with Disney Princesses and Marvel heros roaming the halls giving you opportunities to meet them outside of the designated times on the apps. We ran into Spider-Man, Thor, Captain America and Captain Marvel roaming the halls, as well as Donald, Chip and Dale, Cinderella, Belle and Daisy randomly roaming the halls of the main 3 lower decks. Each one of those meet and great is an experience itself, not just a quick photo but an interaction with the actual character themselves. Spider-man was always a delight to talk to, as if talking to Peter Parker himself. There‚Äôs plenty of adult oriented audience participation shows as well, including the risqu√© Quest scavenger hunt, which included presenting things such as a tattoo in a hidden location, and a man wearing lipstick, be sure to bring cloths and shoes that easily come on and off. Even if you don‚Äôt see the main shows every night, there‚Äôs usually quality musicians playing throughout the ship, Karoke in the main lounge and still lots and lots to do for kids.

Layout- You can tell that Disney has learned a lot since they built the oldest ship in her fleet. The Disney magic is much smaller than the Disney Wish, and the layout is like most cruise ships. With an atrium in the middle of the ship, and a few top decks that contain the rest of the entertainment elements, there‚Äôs still a lot to do on this 24 year old ship. You can tell that they learned to make the Atrium a much bigger area on the Disney Wish, one of my few complaints is that the Atrium is tightly packed during two of the busiest nights, Pirate and Formal night, and with it being the Merrytime cruise, it was usually packed for the holiday themed events as well. Speaking with other passengers, I am certain that it‚Äôs an issue with the Magic and Wonder that was fixed with the later cruise ships.

Service- One of the highlights of any cruise will be the amazing crew, and disneys crew is particularly amazing. We had several members of the crew, and cast members, who provided not just exceptional service but sometimes truly magical experiences. Including our wait staff in the dining room, particularly our server Keeley, who was a delight the entire cruise, despite running around busy all the time, she gave us some tips and insights that only the crew can offer you, like standing on the starboard side of the ship for the pirate night fireworks. Our cabin host, Geo, was also amazing, giving us a different towel animal each night, which Chrisy lives for, including a towel birthday cake for Chrisys birthday. There was also Tommy the Photographer, who I mentioned earlier, who even found some of our missing photos and moved them to our account so we didn‚Äôt miss them.

Room- On average the rooms on a Disney ship are bigger than most cruise ships. There‚Äôs more room to walk, and move around but this is definitely a dated ship, there was a flat screen TV, it is only about 15 inches or so, I think my monitor on my computer is bigger. There are some useful things to use your TV for, like checking your account, or watching information videos, but the system needs an update as it is very slow to navigate. There‚Äôs tons of Disney movies and a handful of shows, as well as a few TV channels, including news and sports, but aside from sleeping, and getting ready you will find yourself so busy you probably won‚Äôt spend enough time in the room to tell the difference. The bed and bedding was amazing, we both slept pretty well on them, both perfectly soft but firm enough for our bad backs. The room does divide into two sleeping areas with a curtain, with the couch being transformable into an additional sleeping space. There are no USB outlets like modern ships, but they do have US and EU based plugs on both sides of the Bed and a few plugs at the desk/vanity area, plenty of room to plug in all of your electronics to charge each day, however the plugs were a bit loose so we found ourselves pulling them out or accidently knocking them off the wall without realizing it. We were able to hear some noise from the hallways and from the room we connected to, but for the most part no unusual noises every awoke or bothered us in our room. There‚Äôs plenty of drawer space, closet space and space under the bed, we found ourselves with more space than we needed and we always pack way more than we will ever need. The room was a bit warm at times, which it wasn‚Äôt a problem at night, but we did wish we could have made it cooler. The ship overall was very warm, another sign that the ship is a bit dated, my wife who freezes every where she goes was frequently warm, which means that I am probably drenched in sweat.

Bathroom- the commode area of our bathroom was tiny, I had to close the door every time I wanted to use the toilet and have enough room to sit down or stay standing. If we didn‚Äôt have a Deluxe verandah, which includes a split bathroom on Disney ships, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have had the issue with the small toilet area. One of the improvements they have made on Wish is having a door instead of a shower curtain, our shower curtain had a mildew smell and I think I got taller during the cruise because my head gradually began to scrape the top of the room every time I took a shower.

Embarking and disembarking- This ship went out of Galveston for the Merrytime cruise, it will be absent next year as it going in to dry dock for an overhaul but we expect it back the following Thanksgiving for Merrytime all over again in 2024 with a facelift. Embarking was easy, we arrived around 12:30 and by that time they were allowing all passengers on board. You load from terminal two in Galveston, we used the convenient express parking provided by the port that is directly next to the terminal and inside the protected port area. After dropping chrisy and our bags off with a porter, I parked, took two minutes to walk to the terminal and we were immediately in queue for security screening and check in. Total process took about 30 minutes and we were on the ship. We had no hangups at security, we brought on two bottles of wine and no soda, but they didn‚Äôt even blink an eye at our two bottles of wine when it went through security. For disembarking, we went to breakfast and waited for them to call our disembarking group, but by the time we finished breakfast, everyone was allowed to disembark, so we then waited in a very long line to disembark, probably about an hour in line on the ship, and then another 10-15 minutes in the terminal to clear customs and leave the terminal. The wait on ship was pretty long, but you can probably either leave earlier or wait longer until the lines die down. Our disembarking on the Disney Wish was the complete opposite. It took very little time to get off the ship and a long long time to clear customs.

Mustering- Disney appears to be back to the older style of mustering, instead of utilizing the more digital way that most ships are doing, where you arrive anytime after embarking, check in to your muster station and they show you in small groups how to put on your life jackets and safety briefing. Instead, you have to gather at your muster stations at the designated time, shipwide, and wait for every single person on the ship to arrive at their muster station before proceeding with the brief.

Conclusion- Overall still a very good cruise, although still an expensive cruise. The price of our cruise was comparable to the price we paid on a 7 day on Carnivals new Mardi Gras, or Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas, both of their new flagships on similar itineraries. I always expect to pay more for a Disney cruise, but you will get an amazing experience. I will probably cruise on the Magic again, more than likely after it‚Äôs next overhaul and hopefully some of the issues like the Air Conditioning get addressed. The entertainment, shows, crew, service and food are all still top notch, despite the age of the ship, which has been well kept for being nearly a quarter of a century old.",Disney Magic 7 Day Very Merrytime cruise review out of Galveston,,shamelessgeek,,0,2022-12-14 15:22:35

Cruise," 

I couldn't get french fries at 2am (so go to sleep). They canceled a stop because an engine broke (you're on a floating paradise; I'm sure you can find something to do). The doctors on board potentially saved my husband's life and we had to pay them for their experience and service (you gotta be shitting me).

I can't believe the attitudes some people have. And the worst thing is, they're ruining their own vacations. Instead of enjoying a wonderful experience with a multitude of amazing activities, they get hung up on anything that goes wrong. What a horrible way to go through life. Do some yoga, smoke some weed, read a book on reframing your outlook; whatever it takes to manage your expectations. There are babies in Africa who won't live past 1 year old because they were born with HIV + malaria + tuberculosis and you're crying because your cruise butler brought you the wrong type of candy bar???

Cruise,"Hi fellow cruisers I need help and advice!

My family went on the Sailing from Nov. 27-Dec. 4. We had 2 junior suites and one inside room. The 2 junior suites next to each other both had bedbugs which we have pictures of the molted shells from in the couch. We found this immediately after we were able to go into our cabins, then went right to guest services and waited an hour and a half for someone to speak to. They sent housekeeping to the rooms who told us we were lying and there was nothing in the rooms. We just wanted clean rooms. We weren't trying to get any upgrades or anything. We even told them if they had no free rooms available we wanted to get off the ship. They sent in another specialist into the rooms and we waited 2 more hours and by this time the ship already sailed so there was no way to get off the ship. They finally found us a obstructed jr suite and 2 balconies. They were clean so we agreed to stay in them. The rest of the cruise was fine, but I was hit with a 300.00 port collection fee which noone could tell me what it was for. Also I was double charged for the cococay excursion and the refreshment package from Black Friday Sale. At this point Royal owed me 904.00 . 

 Update Today: Still havent received the rest of my refunds totally $604.00 and now we were told we were lying about the bed bugs and they will do nothing futher for us.",Bed Bugs on Anthem of the Seas - Sailing Nov.27-Dec 4. Help!!,,littlemscarla,,0,2022-12-14 01:29:40

I‚Äôm on the new MS Rotterdam right now. I was on the MS Zaandam back in May/June. I‚Äôm a 4 Star Mariner. Loved the line for years. The service was always great. Food is outstanding. And it‚Äôs such a relaxing vibe compared to the more ‚Äúparty‚Äù ships. 

But my last two cruises have been significantly worse than how I remembered it. I sit in my dining room table for 30 minutes before I get to order, almost every day. My stewards recently don‚Äôt feel like they do anything more than clean the room and disappear. We meet on the first day and basically never see eachother again. I‚Äôve had guest services hang up on me when I call for anything. Multiple things I used to enjoy feel like former shells of themselves, like Tea Time and a lot of the shows and events. Even the specialty restaurants have worse service but it‚Äôs still a huge step up compared to the dining room. I watch as a lot of the crew stand around talking to eachother doing nothing. I speak up, nothing changes. 

Now I still like Holland. I had worse experiences on Carnival and MSC. But I‚Äôve seen better recently. I had an amazing experience on NCL recently. And Disney is always great. But Holland is starting to dry out in quality for me and I really hope something is done about it.

I'm sailing Norwegian Gem in January and this is our first time we're dealing with the option to put a bid in for an upgrade. We're currently in a balcony but are curious about the upgrades. I'm curious that if you put in a bid and it's rejected, do you have a chance to try again and up your price? Or is this just a one time shot and if it's rejected you're SOL? 

Also, if anyone's done Norwegian, I'm curious if the difference between Balcony and Club Balcony is a big deal in regards to bigger room, bigger sofa bed etc where upgrading is worth it?  We have a few kids and I'm a bit nervous at the idea of the whole bunk bed thing. We've never done Norwegian and never been in a balcony room so small where that was an option.

Hi! 

I‚Äôm hoping someone can please give me some tips/advice for a cruise I‚Äôve reserved, because after reading reviews online I‚Äôm a little wary and apprehensive this cruise might not be what I was hoping.

We‚Äôve booked the 12 night Tokyo-Singapore cruise with stops in Shimizu, Osaka, Kagoshima, Manila, Nha Trang, Ho Chi Minh. Some of the reviews say that there are very few, if any guided excursions available for English speakers, with some reviews stating they were basically left to their own devices and struggled with the language barrier (which is my main concern, as I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll get much from the trip without being guided). 

The second query I have is about the ship- Spectrum of the Seas. I have read very mixed reviews about this ship. I‚Äôm not concerned about it being tailored to the Asian market (this would be expected), but many reviews speak about the quality of the food. 

Does anyone have any comments or tips about either of these things? Have any of you been to any of these ports and know which excursions we offered?

Broken down numerically and sorted at the end of my cruise to organize it a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

   


Things no one should be ok with:  
1. No one on the boat can speak English properly or give you directions. When you order food you have to repeat yourself 3x and point to the menu and wait for them to confer with a co worker before they realize what you want.  


Random thoughts of things the ship / staff did wrong:  
1. The room is very spacious but for some reason they gave us a handicapped room and then the sliding door fell off of its track when an eight-year-old pushed it.  
2.  Service staff is overwhelmed, poorly trained or not skilled... you ask for sweet and low three times before they bring you something that's not sweet and low.    
3.   Touch screen interfaces on various systems are failing, glitching, resetting .. it's difficult to do anything with those wall mounted touchscreens.  
4. During the performances volume was too loud and the performers were okay but not impressive; the descriptions of the shows could have been better highlighting the actual music that would be played at the rock suggesting the actual plays that would be shown during the best of.  This is high school quality or barely community theater level at best.  
5.  The Mariviglia was supposed to be one of the largest ships.. yet it moves a lot almost constantly like turbulence in an airplane!  Very noticeable people are almost falling over once in a while and the weather's beautiful there's no reason for it apparently Disney cruises don't do this but the staff on the boat says its normal.  
6. They took us to their private island .. day one everything was closed, I mean EVERYTHING.... Day 2 everything was closed until mid day when a few overpriced stores selling junk opened up, the Bar was open... there was nothing to do on the beach, no slide, no buckets or shovesl - nothing for kids to do, nothing for adults to do.. outside of drink and sit on a chair... All the available excursions were canceled due to some unknown reason.. wind I think?   The restaurants don't open until later in the day; and guess what? The awful garbage food from the ship is what is served at those places... so you can't even buy good food on the island!   Oh and yes there is a general store -- hidden there - for the employees only.. but none of us passengers were allowed into that area to buy anything...    
7. While we were at the island; all the stores on the ship closed. including most restaurants.    
8. There was no entertainment happening on the ship most of the time... then occasionally at 7pm on the dot there would be 4 things to do.. but alas!! Day care didnt re open until 7.. so you can't get to it until 7:15 and now you've missed a good bit of your entertainment!  
9. They had a store with 60 kinds of alcohol for sale, including bottles that cost THOUSANDS OF Dollars... they had 40 kinds of cigarettes available.. but if you wanted FOOD? (you know cause the island is closed.. the ships stuff is closed.. your starving...) Well they have 2 chocolate bars, a couple bags of odd candy and thats it.  Shameful...   
10. Our 'minibar' was locked when we arrived and we had to call and request that it be unlocked.  We found pringles in there we could have paid 5.00 for.. exciting.. what a bargain! thats only about 40 cents per chip as it was a tiny container...  
11. On ship communications is ineffective through the app and communicating with your children is nearly impossible unless you sit at the cabin.  You are supposed to be able to message each other via the app but it did not work... messages appear to send but not receive...  
12.There were no trash cans around ship?  I guess you just leave your garbage randomly anywhere as you walk around and hope someone picks it up.  
13. TV is in the wrong side of the room and doesn't even rotate or move.  
14. The app schedule is hidden from past events on the app; the entertainment was lousy.  
15. Final call to port is not listed on the app!  
16. The cleaners will say hi, everyone who gets tips might be polite but anyone who doesnt get tipped will walk right into you and not apologize as they continue to do their job... you are in their way.. how dare you exist on their ship!  This includes people wearing suits that look like managers.  
17. No one in the ship knew their own jobs; nor did they know anything about the ship, where things were, what was happening, almost everyone outside of the guest relations people were incompetant uneducated people who should be forced to go through a basic training and ship orientation.  
18. There was some type of 'medical emergency' that made them turn around and head back to port... this ruined the cruise for everyone else as now we arrived at the island so late that nothing could be done that day.  Why didn't they call the coast guard and have that passenger life flighted away on a helicopter?  


About the food:  Some of this is personal preference, other things are FDA violations.  


1.  The iced tea has lemon in it and fake sugar.  
2. The tomato soup as no crackers they will give you a giant spoon that won't fit in your mouth and it is really watered down and tastes a little bit like ketchup I'd say 10% ketchup 90% water   
3.You get unsalted butter at the table  
4. All of the delicious looking desserts are sugar-free with fake aspertane or sucralose.   
5. The kids menu is only for babies; literally 6 months and under or 12 months and under!  
6. The pizza crust is burnt on pita bread with no flavor sauce not enough cheese and its just lousy.  
7. The ice cream is delicious; but they took away the Vanilla after day 1 and the child we had would not eat the odd flavors they replaced it with.  They should have all flavors every day!  
8.  The food is poor quality, cooked in a non sterile way, burnt or undercooked and made my girlfriend sick every time she ate it.  I brought crackers and ate them instead so I didnt get sick.   Example; the first round of bacon was not fully cooked The second time I asked them for crispy and it came back completely devoid of moisture and had no flavor at all.  The orange juice cups  had black debris floating in the top, the fish sticks were unedible, the condimints were in a bowl with a ladel for you to scoop out your ketchup or whatever... the burgers were bunt, dried up with unmelted cheese on top as they were cold, the buns were dried up and stale.. I could go on for an hour.  
9. The cups are ridiculously small they should be three times bigger or you just have to ask for three cups  
10. They don't have cream they might offer you low fat milk for your coffee.  
11. They dont have NORMAL whole milk; only FAT free or questionable milk in a giant jug that may or may not be at the proper temperature..   
12. They only have strawberry jelly and it's not good quality and it's only in part and no grape or other flavors  
13. The hash browns on the buffet are not cooked all the way, the liquid egg they poured out of the bottle wasnt cooked all the way through, the bacon is either burnt or not raw, the sausage is dried out and nasty. the chocolate cake is dried out and nasty The grapefruit juices ridiculously salty and there's nothing else on that station The next station has orange juice but it's not really orange juice It's water There's no apple juice anywhere one station has hot milk but no creamer you can find creamer at another station...  
14. They have six different kinds of cereal all of them are sugar-free so they taste absolutely lousy especially when you add fat-free milk that has no flavor from MacArthur dairy... ( they should have whole milk)  
15. They should offer a toaster or a microwave or something for us to cook our own food because their chefs are lousy or maybe they could keep stuff warm the bread is all cold dried out poor flavored bagels have no cream cheese.  
16. Hadi buffet manager was polite when I complained, he feigned interest in my issues and we received chocolate covered strawberries as an apology.. but the next day the food and service was just as bad everywhere we went so nothing changed.","MSC Meraviglia?

Cruise,"It seems like there is a lot of misinformation/confusion in regards to what form of ID is acceptable to travel with so I thought it would be wise to make this post. 

The REAL ID is what will be required to board any domestic flight after May 7, 2025. Once you provide the necessary documentation, you will have a little gold star on the right hand corner of your license. Some states are referring to this as an ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù license but it is not. You cannot board a cruise ship with this form of identification without another form (ex. birth certificate).

TLDR: you cannot enter the US by land or sea with a REAL ID but it is acceptable for domestic flights. 

An Enhanced Drivers License (EDL) is a form of identification that is ONLY ISSUED IN FIVE STATES - Michigan, Vermont, New York, Washington, and Minnesota. Once you provide the proper documentation, your license will have the words ‚Äúenhanced drivers license‚Äù or ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù on it as well as an American flag. You can use this on any domestic flights as well as for land and sea crossings to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. A passport is still required to fly internationally. They provide proof of US citizenship and identity and thus are allowed for domestic, closed loop cruising (i.e. you start and end in a U.S. port). 

TLDR: the EDL can be used to fly domestically and for land and sea crossings to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. You still need a passport to fly internationally. 

As always, if you have any questions, it is wise to contact the cruise line or the proper government entity.",REAL ID v EDL,,CrzPart,,0,2022-12-12 15:44:28

Cruise," **-Planning your travel**

There are a few things to consider when planning a trip. The first is deciding where to go. Do some research and decide on a destination. Once you have a destination in mind, start researching what there is to do and see in the area. Once you have a general idea of what you want to do and see, start planning your trip. Figure out how you will get to your destination and what hotels or other accommodations you will need. Make sure to purchase travel insurance in case of an emergency. Once you have everything planned out, it's time to start packing! Make a list of what you will need and pack accordingly. Have a great trip!

**-Finding the best deals on flights**

There are a few things to keep in mind when looking for the best deal on a flight. First, be flexible with your travel dates and times. Sometimes, leaving a day earlier or later can save you a lot of money. Also, consider flying on a less popular day to fly. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday are usually the cheapest days to fly. Finally, compare prices between different airlines and websites. Sometimes, the difference in price can be quite significant.

**-Tips for reducing your travel costs**

**There are many ways to reduce your travel costs. Here are a few tips:**

1. Plan your trip well in advance. Often, the earlier you book, the cheaper the tickets will be.

2. Compare prices between different airlines and travel websites.

3. Fly during off-peak hours.

4. Book a seat in the economy section rather than the business or first class.

5. Consider travelling by bus or train rather than flying.

6. Stay in hostels or budget hotels rather than luxury hotels.

7. Eat at local restaurants rather than in expensive tourist traps.

8. Avoid buying souvenirs.

9. Use public transportation rather than renting a car.

10. Shop around for the best deals on flights, hotels, and car rentals.

**-How to save money on your trip**

Saving money on your trip doesn‚Äôt have to be hard. In fact, there are plenty of ways to do it without making too many sacrifices. Here are a few tips to help you out:

‚Ä¢ Stay in budget accommodation. There are plenty of great options out there that won‚Äôt break the bank.

‚Ä¢ Eat at local restaurants. Not only will you save money, but you‚Äôll also get to experience the local cuisine.

‚Ä¢ Travel during the off-season. Prices are usually much cheaper during the offseason.

‚Ä¢ Avoid tourist traps. There‚Äôs no need to spend more money than you have to.

‚Ä¢ Bring your own snacks and drinks. This can help you save a lot of money, especially if you‚Äôre travelling with kids.

‚Ä¢ Use public transportation.

This is a great way to save money while also getting to see the local sights.

Cruise,"Hey guys,

I booked my cruise through cruises.com about two months ago. We depart next week and when I was checking in I noticed that NCL is looking to collect for the gratuities. 

When we booked our cruise, we really only did it because of this promotion. Anyways, we paid and we got the invoice from cruises.com and it mentions the type of cabin, it mentions free at sea and it even mentions the prepaid gratuities.

However, when I log into NCL they are asking for the gratuities up front.

Does anyone know what‚Äôs going on here?
Will the credit be added once on board, or will I get screwed over paying the extra 250? The last thing I want is for the workers to get screwed. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

My big hangup, though, is I hate summer. I don't like the sun. I don't like the beach. Mostly, it stems from the fact that I have very sensitive skin and burn so easily. My other issue is that I'm very heat intolerant. Summers for me are just miserable and it's my least favorite season. Summer is just sweating, sunburning, rash guards, constant reapplication of sunscreen, wet and sweaty clothes. Yuck.

Yet, cruising always seems like it's beaches, oceans, summer and sand. Are there other options? Not necessarily winter or ice, but maybe more activities indoors away from the sun? Or climates that are under 80 degrees? We love travel and adventure, just not in the hot sun. Some of our favorites have been indoor water parks, overnight Amtrak trips, tours up into the mountains (Pike's Peak was amazing), horseback riding trails, interactive museums, landmarks and architecture, an underground cave river boat tour, cultural lessons and sightseeing, learning and doing-types of experiences.

Have been cruising for almost 13 years, this is the most unbearable, uncomfortable dizzying total bullshit cruise I've ever been on.

They are nickel and diming every single thing in little time and the ship has been rocking non-stop almost every hour at sea. The water is as calm as could be, you can feel the counterweights moving throughout the entire ship and you never get a SINGLE minute of peace if you're even remotely sensitive to motion sickness. Drink package?? Forget it, I don't think I need to explain how it'd be a colossal waste of money to be drinking Veuve Clicquot while trying to hold your lunch down for 18 hours on end. Let alone a fucking light beer that's free. Slipped and fell outside of a bathroom and now get to walk around on a bruised knee painful to walk and didn't even bother to mention to guest services other than the nearest staff to the slippery floor, because I know the outcome will be a load of shit.

The entire trip has been a bi-polar disappointment of back and forth rocking enough to give you a headache and send you back to the cabin to miss out on every single activity on board, only to lay in bed and listen to creaking walls, and everything shaking. The only relaxation you get is in port and when you're already on the island.

Manhattan room was so nauseating from the movement, myself and another couldn't make it through the appetizers, I remember loads of fond, COMFORTABLE memories with family in the Manhattan room over the last decade.

Cagney's was top 5 one of the WORST meals I have ever had in my life, steak was terrible, mashed potatoes disgusting, onion soup tasted like flavorless sink water, sauteed mushrooms tasted like they were boiled and completely tasteless (HOW do you fuck up mushrooms for a $200 bill??????)

I understand inflation and that these are some of the earliest post-pandemic vacations to happen and every cruise line is in full blown survival mode, but the illusion has cracked, lots of people look miserable, passive aggressive attitudes in the elevators from a bunch of ass hats trying to get 1 floor down with their fucking Jack and Cokes. Disgusting. St. Thomas was a complete shit show of a tourist trap (Yes, like most of the destinations on any cruise line), with nothing but handicaps on rascals scooting around and blowing their retirement checks on cheap junk sold by non-native investors.

I could go on for hours, beyond disappointed and will never be going on another cruise as long as I live.

Nothing in this world could have made me feel more like a shitty American slob who's only purpose in life is to fund the rich lifestyles and end up 60 years down the road hobbling around on a culturally appropriated island like a lobotomized sheep looked down upon by everyone with disgust.

Cruise,"Because the subject is so confusing, I see questions about identification and visas posted here pretty frequently. I hope to use this post to clarify some of it.

## THE JIST

All documents used for entry into the United States must meet [Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI)](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/western-hemisphere-travel-initiative) compliance, in which the traveler must present proof of identity and citizenship. Requirements to travel by air are more strict than doing so by land and sea. It is from this that all US-based cruise lines derive their documentation requirements from.

While it was once true that presenting a state ID and birth certificate was sufficient to gain entry into the US (even just an ID once upon a time), identification requirements have gotten more strict over the years. Closed-loop cruising is one of the few modes of travel remaining where adults can still use them as a form of identification.

**HERE'S THE TL;DR:** If you have enough documentation to go on a cruise, you have enough to get a Passport. Just go get one, for crying out loud. The process is not complicated or expensive, and they are good for 10 years (5 for kids). They solve almost any identification requirement, not just those related to travel. You can even pay extra to expedite delivery if time is short.

If you plan to travel outside of the US, at all ever, [do it](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).

## CLOSED LOOP CRUISING FROM THE UNITED STATES

A ""closed loop"" cruise is one that begins and ends in the same port. To board a cruise from the United States, you will need one of the following documents or (set of documents) with more than 6 months left until expiration, where applicable:

* Passport
* Passport Card
* Trusted Traveler Card (NEXUS, SENTRI or Global Entry)
* Federally recognized Tribal Identification card
* State issued Enhanced ID or Enhanced Drivers License
* Government issued identification and state issued birth certificate. This is ONLY ALLOWED for closed loop cruises.

Note that a ""certificate of live birth"" (with the little footprints) is not a valid birth certificate. If a state issues both ""long form"" and ""short form"" birth certificates, only the ""long form"" complies with identification requirements.

## TRAVELING DOMESTICALLY BY AIR

When traveling within the US by air, the [TSA requires a valid form of identification](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification) that is more strict than the ""government issued"" ID required for traveling by cruise.

To cross the security checkpoint, you will need to provide one of the following, recognized as identification at the Federal level:

* Passport
* Passport Card
* Trusted Traveler Card (NEXUS, SENTRI or Global Entry)
* Federally recognized Tribal Identification card (Canada or US)
* State/Province/Tribal issued Enhanced ID or Enhanced Drivers License (Canada or US)
* State issued ""REAL-ID"" compliant ID or Drivers License (this depends by state, so check yours)
* Canadian provincial ID or Drivers License
* Various naturalization, permanent resident and other documents issued for immigration purposes.

## OPEN LOOP AND INTERNATIONAL CRUISES

All other cruise itineraries require the same identification as any other travel by sea. This includes cruises that begin and end in different US ports, such as one-way Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico itineraries, and repositioning itineraries.

For itineraries that begin and end in another country, treat these cruises like any other form of international travel. If you are flying into a country to start a cruise, you need to meet their arrival requirements. If you are flying back to the US after ending abroad, you need to meet the WHTI air travel requirements.

## THE PASSPORT BOOK IS BULKY AND A PAIN TO DEAL WITH

I agree, and there are many convenient credit-card sized ID alternatives for cruising. I still recommend bringing a Passport, but a secondary WHTI-compliant ID is not only convenient to carry, it serves as a backup in case the Passport gets lost.

* Passport Card. When ordering a Passport, you have the option to tack on a Passport Card for a small fee. This document is not as useful as the Passport itself, but it serves just fine for domestic air travel and reentry by land or sea.
* Enhanced ID / Drivers License. 5 states, 4 provinces and certain native tribes offer Enhanced IDs, which act as a Passport Card combined with a local ID. To obtain one, you must provide the same documentation you would for a Passport, or a Passport itself. If this is an option, I recommend ""upgrading"" when you next renew your license. Hint: the DMV person will love you if you present a Passport when applying rather than a slew of other documents; mine issued a verbal sigh of relief.
* Trusted Traveler Card. The Trusted Traveler Program is targeted for those who travel frequently and are willing to sacrifice some privacy for the convenience of skipping lines. These require a lot of footwork to obtain, and are discussed further below.

## DO I NEED A VISA?

One's eligibility to enter a country depends heavily on citizenship and background. Canada, for example, will not allow those convicted of DUI entry regardless of circumstance. So take everything here with a grain of salt, and do your own research.

**Generally speaking** though, as long as one can legally board the cruise and disembark at the destination, it is highly unlikely a visa is required before entry.

For a traveler in good standing with a valid passport, most countries will automatically grant a visitor visa upon entry. Furthermore, cruising is a special beast when it comes to international travel. Cruise travelers move as one big group, and they generally only stay one or two days in each port, so their arrival and departure is handled as a batch. Such travelers are low-risk and cash rich, which means big business, so there is some leniency to visa requirements where they might otherwise be complicated. Turkey, for example, usually requires any traveler to have a visa issued in advance, but for cruisers they issue a temporary pass upon arrival.

Cruise lines require documentation details prior to boarding, and they forward a passenger manifest to local authorities, so any issue with admission *should* be identified before you board. If a specific port denied a traveler entry while on the cruise, I believe the worst case scenario is that the traveler would have to stay on the ship while in port. But that's just my belief; the best advice is not to be in that position in the first place and know if you are *persona non grata* in Belize.

## WHAT IDENTIFICATION DO I NEED IN PORT?

This is one of those ""in practice"" versus ""in reality"" situations.

You will see a lot of recommendations about taking photocopies of your ID, taking your passport, etc. There really aren't many wrong answers. Rather, it's about risk tolerance of taking documents with you. You are simply more likely to lose critical documents while in port than you are of needing them to get home.

My stance: if you are just hanging in port, bring your ship card and any old photo ID or picture of one. If you are leaving the port, bring the ship card and a WHTI-compliant ID (Passport or other) for the extremely unlikely event of getting left behind.

What you can expect from any port security is to be challenged when you attempt to approach the vessel. The main thing they want to see is a ship card that shows name, cruise line and date of voyage, which keeps out anyone who doesn't have a reason to be there. By itself, this card is usually enough because the ship security will further match you with the picture they have on file as you board. Bringing a Photo ID is also a very good idea, both for if the port guards want to challenge you further and if you plan on using a credit card on shore.

## WHAT IF I LOSE MY ID / KEY CARD?

I've had the unfortunate experience of leaving a wallet at an excursion with insufficient time to retrieve it; straight no ID or ship key when approaching the port. This was a headache, but it's not an unusual scenario. My experience was that when you approach the port guard and explain the situation, they will summon ship security. Ship security will then match the details you provide with the information they have; the photo you took at the start of the cruise goes a long way.

In this scenario, it was a *good* thing my Passport was still in my stateroom safe. The real drag was having to immediately cancel all the credit cards, etc., that I left behind and going about getting a new ID when I returned.

At the end of the day, security is ultimately about confidence, and tourists usually look and act like tourists. You want to get on the ship, and they want a full passenger list before they leave port. Almost every passenger is traveling with someone who can confirm their identity, but even if you are traveling solo mentioning that is a qualifying detail. As long as you can confirm the details they ask for - because you are legit, of course - they are almost certain not to leave you behind.

Try not to let it happen, but if it does don't stress.

## WHAT IF THE SHIP LEAVES ME BEHIND, OR I NEED TO STAY FOR EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES?

When you are getting close to departure time and you hear the loudspeaker calling for certain passengers to report to guest services, the crew is almost certainly looking for someone who hasn't returned. They are hoping the guest somehow slipped past security or their card didn't register, but the most likely scenario is that they are still over at Senior Frog's or stuck in traffic.

Despite the aggressive posturing, cruise ships don't want to leave anyone behind in a foreign port. Quite the opposite - they want you back on the ship with plenty of time to spare. Make no mistake, **THE SHIP WILL LEAVE WITHOUT YOU,** and if they do you are responsible for dealing with that, but they would rather you be on the ship if at all possible. Imagine the paperwork of leaving home with 2000 guests and returning with 1990 and having to tell the authorities it's because those passengers weren't back promptly by 4:00.

That said, leaving a harbor involves a lot more than taking a car out of a parking lot, and all those folks have lives to return to. Eventually the call will be made to get out of harbor rather than be stuck in port all night waiting for stragglers.

If you are on a ship-sanctioned excursion, cruise line policy is that they will not leave port until those guests return, if at all possible. If for some reason the excursion cannot return to the ship, the line takes on the burden of getting you back to it as soon as possible. Not ideal, but at least it's not on you.

That peace of mind is the main reason I book through the line despite the up charge. I've been on one excursion where we were over an hour late, and while the crew and harbormaster were chomping at the bit to hustle us onboard, there was no real danger that they would leave without us because they knew we were on our way and the costs of sending all of ahead was prohibitive.

SO.

If you are shopping in port or drinking bad tequila at Sammy Hagar's bar and things suddenly get quiet, that's a good sign you need to get back to the ship proto.

If you are having difficulty returning to the ship and not with someone associated with the cruise line, there is a number on the back of your ship card to call to let them know what is going on. This is where signing up for that ""international day pass"" for your cell phone comes in handy. Obviously you are in much more jeopardy of truly being left behind, but they will still try to accommodate until the logistics of the voyage outweigh the complications of your absence.

Lastly, in the circumstance where you have to stay ashore due to an emergency, the ship will accommodate that to the best of their ability. Let them know as soon as you can, and get what you need off the ship as soon as possible.

If you do get left behind, the ship will most likely leave your critical items - ID, phones, medicines - with the Port Agent, a representative for the line. In that unfortunate circumstance, this agent will help you take the next step.

## IS THE [TRUSTED TRAVELER PROGRAM](https://ttp.dhs.gov/) RIGHT FOR ME?

Passports and related documents are issued by the State Department. Trusted Traveler is the provenance of the Department of Homeland Security, so while closely tied with documentation from State it is a separate beast altogether. A Passport is required to apply to any of the Trusted Traveler Programs.

With the exception of PreCheck, all Trusted Traveler Programs are ways to enter participating countries through a special, expedited line by having done an extensive background check and submitting bio-metrics. These programs supply an ID card that can be used at special lanes when traveling by vehicle, and serves as a WHTI-compliant document. PreCheck specifically applies to security lines at airports and does not provide a card, but is included as a perk of most of the other programs. All require an interview with Border Patrol agents.

* Global Entry is for expedited entry to the US from any location. This has the most flexible interview locations, including most major airports.
* NEXUS is for expedited entry to the US or Canada from any location. A bit cheaper than Global Entry, but interviews are with both Canadian and US officials and can only be done in locations that host both. This is mostly appropriate for those who travel to Canada frequently, or who frequently use Canadian airports as hubs for air travel. Canadian and Mexican citizens are also eligible.
* SENTRI is for expedited entry to the US or Mexico from any location, and includes special registration for a vehicle. It is more expensive than Global Entry, interviews are with both Mexican and US officials and can only be done in locations that host both. This is mostly appropriate for travelers who frequently drive across the US/Mexico border.

If you are ever considering PreCheck you may as well apply for Global Entry if you are eligible because it is basically the same process. Scheduling an interview in a reasonable time frame is the hardest part, especially after COVID, so the earlier you apply the sooner you can get it done.

Not everyone who applies is granted Trusted Traveler status, and for obvious reasons DHS doesn't list the criteria. I *can* say that my wife, who is from the US territory of Guam and traveled to the Middle East as a small child, was scrutinized far more heavily than I was coming from the continental US and never having gone beyond Canada before I was in my 20s.

There are also understandable privacy concerns regarding the program, as there is a lot of information to submit and the terms allow for cross-agency sharing of your information, including to those friendly folks at the FBI. That said, this isn't really much of a concern for those of us who choose to live on the grid and understand that even without this program, the ubiquitous ""They"" already know enough about us to piece it together.

The primary benefit of PreCheck is skipping the longer lines at the airport and usually means avoiding the backscatter machines that freak me out. On reentry to the US (as well as Canada and Mexico for the appropriate programs), Customs has a special Trusted Traveler lane where you do not have to sign a declaration. In many places you don't even need to interview with an agent - you just get a ticket from a machine that confirms your identity and present it to the guard on the way out. While these programs are of minor benefit at a cruise port, at the airport these things make life a thousand times better.

## CONCLUSION

As I mentioned before, if you don't have a Passport, save yourself the headache and just go get one. If you have the wherewithal, get another WHTI document that fits in your wallet/purse and use it as your primary means of identification while on the cruise itself.

All in all, it was a decent time, but I wasn't in the right headspace: had just lost a very close family member a few weeks earlier and was traveling with someone who had never cruised before (even though we were in separate cabins, I felt I needed to be ""on and ready"" at all times). I was ready to get off the ship on day two, but did my best to make the most of it. 

Now I have an opportunity to take the same ship and itinerary in Feb, but this time go completely solo. Princess solo fairs are priced well compared to other lines, but I think other lines may do a better job catering to the solo traveler. However, there is comfort in getting back on a ship that I'm already familiar with and leaving from the port of LA is super convenient. In fact, I've reserved the cabin directly next door to the one I had in Nov. All that said, there's something keeping me from making final payment (which is due this Tuesday). 

I lean more introverted and enjoy my alone time, which I feel I'm overdue after this past year (there's a lot more to the backstory than what I shared above). I'm not big on activities or excursions, which I feel like is necessary on a solo cruise, along with being more outgoing. 

Anyway, looking to hear from like-minded folks who have done solo on Princess in the past. Was it awkward at times? Did you book specialty dining? Or favorite parts of going alone?","One More ""Should I Go Alone?"" Thread...",,Educational_Joke1754,,0,2022-12-05 14:15:11
Cruise,"Hi! Back in October my boyfriend contacted our travel agent after seeing that the price of the cruise went down. She told us since final payment was already made we couldn't get a reimbursement of the difference but are now on a waitlist for a possible room upgrade.  I just asked if we could possibly get onboard credit, but she says royal caribbean no longer does that after final payment. 

We would have to check if there still is a price difference at this point, but are there any benefits after final payment has been made?

Thank you.",Any benefits after final payment? Royal Caribbean Cruise,,StaB26,,0,2022-12-05 14:02:27

I'm trying to find a solution so when I'm in the room I can share my internet with other things. Also when I am on board the ship and throughout the ship to share my phone with my wife's device.

Cruise,"I‚Äôve always been so loyal to Princess because I‚Äôve always had a great experience with them and built some status. So when a family member suggested a Celebrity cruise down to Mexico, I thought it would be fun to try a different cruise line. Well, it‚Äôs been a cluster F since I slapped my deposit down. First they swapped our scheduled, almost new ship out on us for the much smaller and older Solstice (it‚Äôs about to be dry docked for renos). 

Once we got on board, they tried to tell us we don‚Äôt have the free classic drinks package, basic Wi-Fi and gratuities that were offered with booking.  I had to fight hard to get them restored to my account but they finally did.

The ship is nice but very old, worn out, and small with few amenities. But the most disappointing thing is definitely the food. Everything is beautifully presented but just‚Ä¶very ok. We‚Äôre a party of 6 and everyone agrees that the food quality has gone way downhill (4 of our cruisers have been on Celebrity before). We even overheard a conversation on the elevator by a couple who didn‚Äôt enjoy their dinner (they said sucked).

The gelato, which you have to pay extra for, was downright awful. The salad dressings are bottled and taste strongly of preservatives. Everything tastes like Sysco food with some sprigs of garnishment on the side. Even the burger bar was something like what you‚Äôd get at a high school baseball game. Just very, very basic and nothing at all really tasty or special.

The band is frequently off-key and pretty cringy. Then today (day 2 of the cruise), my benefits have disappeared off our account again. I get the feeling this is going to be a daily battle and my credit card will *still* be charged for the things that were supposed to be included. &lt;sigh&gt;

I know these are first world problems but the only reason I‚Äôm sharing my feedback is to warn others to consider cruising with someone other than Celebrity if you have a choice. 

The one thing that is absolutely tip top is the service. Every employee I‚Äôve met has been so warm, welcoming and exceptional. So that part has been very nice to be fair and balanced.",On Celebrity Solstice now and we‚Äôre not impressed.,,JennieFairplay,,0,2022-12-05 08:20:09

Cruise,"Hello! I‚Äôve been Googling / Browsing cruise line sites but Looking to narrow my search down and tips on where to start with planning a cruise for my family in 2023. 

I‚Äôm more interested in the ship / on board experience than anything but looking for some insight on: cruise line / specific ship, destination, month of travel. 

A little more info: 
-must be a US departure port 
- It would be me (33f), my sister + brother in law (both 30), my mom and her boyfriend (both 65). We are a fun, tight knit family that have similar interests. This would be their first cruise and my second, but first one I‚Äôm actually planning. 
- we love live music, spa treatments, social drinking and sunbathing 

Best Cruise line / ship for: 
- adult only
- amazing food 
- premium drink packages
- variety of high quality entertainment options (live music, comedy shows, interactive games, casino, etc.) 
- large pools and pool deck 
- not over crowded but still lively 
- good mix of chill and fun 
- leisurely upscale- think laid back but classy (if that makes sense lol) 
- good vibes / friendly and fun (but not wild) passengers 

Best destination / time of year for:
- warm / comfortably hot temperatures for laying out by the pool and swimming weather
- sunny skies and calm waters 

That being said any/ all tips on what might be a good fit and/ or general cruise advice for beginners is much appreciated!

I‚Äôm in no way complaining and maybe I‚Äôm asking for too much but I‚Äôm pretty easy going and I had hoped for more out out the trip. the waters were extremely rough (unusually so per crew and guests), lots of kids and elderly ppl on board, food was mediocre at best, weather was warm but too cold / breezy to lay out by the pool, ports were too manufactured and pop-up tourist townish for me and while we still had a great time and I‚Äôm glad I went, I‚Äôm looking for something quite different this time around.

This will not be my first time cruising (have been 5 times previously but it's been several years) but it will be his first cruise and our first cruise as a couple. We are looking go for 7 nights somewhere warm (either Mexico out of LA or any option out of Florida). We've done a lot of research but are finding it somewhat overwhelming to narrow down options. We like good food, and lead a decently actively lifestyle. We also love seeing new places so a more port-intensive route would probably be best and are on the younger side (late twenties). While we enjoy a good cocktail we aren't party-people by any means. We would also like to choose a line that is more environmentally friendly if at all possible (we realize no line is perfect but would like to give our money towards a company that actively and authentically thinking about the environment).  We will also probably be booking for late Feb in early Jan so pretty last minute and are open to being flexible as a result. With all this in mind, I've narrowed down our options to Royal, Virgin, Princess and Celebrity.

As a major in Tourism and Hospitality, I'd imagine it'd be natural to see a drop in quality that'd come with the introduction of dozens of brand new hires in a lot of front-of-the-house positions (Reception, Housekeeping, Accounting etc.), so I wondered if that has been the case or has the drop been seemless from a guest's point of view?",Changes in Quality on NCL?,,Gorilla-Samurai,,0,2022-12-02 22:53:06

This was of course hit and miss, but seemed cheaper if a little sketchy on a few. We had enough leeway and flexibility that had things gone totally sideways somewhere, mised the ship or whatever, we could make our way home.

we have planned out a 7 day royal caribbean cruise to the T which departs may 13th and visits roatan, belize city, cozumel, and cococay. out of curiosity i looked around to see if any other lines had longer cruises in may with destinations we would enjoy and came across a 9 night norwegian trip. it‚Äôs itinerary is great stirrup cay, st thomas, antigua, st maarten, san juan, and puerto plata. we have not cruised with norwegian before and would like any and all opinions regarding which we should choose!

norwegian‚Äôs trip on the getaway would be around $2700. this includes their advertised open bar (i have read that this can be misleading so feel free to share your experiences!) it also includes the advertised BOGO flights and we would get to fly out of our local airport less than 15 min from our house which is a plus. 

the RC trip plus flights, 1 night in a FLL hotel, and transportation to/from the cruise terminal would be around $2100. the only difference is we would be flying out of an airport 1.5 hours from our house for this trip to save on flights. both trips are priced with an interior room (:

a little bit about us that may help when determining which is better!

- we bought drinks a la carte on our RC trip this year but were planning on buying packages this time
- we dont really bother trying to get in the pool on the ship; both enjoy laying out on the upper deck‚Äôs loungers during days at sea
- weren‚Äôt overly impressed or dissapointed with RC‚Äôs food - were just happy to not have to cook or clean for a week and have plenty of options
- ship entertainment does not matter much to us - we did enjoy listening to karaoke a couple of nights but didn‚Äôt attend any shows
- love getting in the hot tub in the evenings
- did not purchase internet on RC and do not want internet access on our trip even if it‚Äôs free lol

some things we loved about royal caribbean: 
- their app was really helpful especially while still finding our way around the ship
- we frequented the frozen yogurt machine at the pool each day haha
- going to the casino after dinner
- complimentary room service breakfast for early days at port
- our bed on mariner of the seas was extremely comfortable
- super friendly staff! 
- pizza, cookies, tea, etc. available 24 hours a day at the promenade
- poolside servers
- we go through a LOT of towels so RC‚Äôs beach towel rental system was convenient

overall, we enjoy the simple things on the ship and make the most of our days at port. all of the videos i‚Äôve watched of the norwegian getaway look great but the forums i‚Äôve read comparing norwegian to RC scare me a little lol. however, i know some people are MUCH harder to please than we are so i try to take those reviews with a grain of salt. 

i would greatly appreciate any and all insight!! thanks in advance (:",experienced cruisers! i need help comparing 2 cruises for may 2023!!,,morgxn427,,0,2022-11-30 03:04:30

Cruise,Hello. I'm selling a Norwegian Cruise Line credit. I paid for a $250 credit that's worth $500. They are not allowing me to use it for our reservation because my girlfriend use to work for them years ago. We didn't know it was not allowed. This is my first time cruising with them and probably my last since this whole ordeal has been since a pain in the ass. The credit is 100% transferable. Willing to let it go for $200. Thank you!,Norwegian Cruise Line cruise next credit,,kvargas407,,0,2022-11-29 16:37:08

Cruise,"We just booked our first cruise, being Royal Caribbean Symphony of the Seas. We‚Äôre flying into Ft. Lauderdale the day before, and we‚Äôre worried about the best way to get down there and where to stay‚Ä¶.

‚Ä¢ is Uber-ing from the Ft. Lauderdale airport down to Miami realistic? If not, any shuttles?

‚Ä¢ any good hotels near the Miami port to stay for a night?

‚Ä¢ once the ship returns, are there plenty of Ubers to leave, or do we need to schedule a shuttle to pick us up there as well?",First time. Any port of Miami tips?,,garrettlp,,0,2022-11-29 15:28:43
