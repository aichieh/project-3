backpacking,"Hello everyone! Can we make a brainstorm and find a way for me to get a Schengen visa? I will be very grateful if you can give me some ideas.

I am from Turkey and unfortunately I need a visa to visit Europe. I worked as a teacher for 6 years. Then I quit my job to travel full time 2 years ago. I have 4 old Schengen visas, one of them was for one year. But when I got those visas, I was a student or I had a good job so I had all the documents they asked for. If you don’t have a job, money, or something that keeps you in your county(like school, or properties etc) it’s almost impossible to get a tourist visa. And right now I don’t have anything. I am just a full time traveler without money and job. But that gives me freedom, I can do whatever to get a visa. I can apply to universities or I can find a temporary job, language courses, even fake marriage hahah

My goal is just to be able to visit Europe. If I apply for a tourist visa, they’ll refuse me. Do you have any other ways to apply? Considering that I don’t have money in my bank account.

Probably people who needs visa for Schengen like me will understand and help me better. Thanks in advance for your help.

Additionally: Someone will probably ask me how I travel if I don’t have money. I use couchsurfing and workaway to not to pay anything for accommodation. I cook for myself and barely eat outside. I am trying not to spend anything. And sometimes I get some online jobs, just a side hustle not an actual job. And that’s enough for my little expenses.",Can you help me to find a way to get Schengen visa,,ipek-kara,,0,4/1/2023 21:43

backpacking,"Doing another Southeast Asia tour starting this summer and was reminiscing on a four day stay I did in Bankok in 2016. Initially, I went to Thailand to get my scuba diving certs, but the entire southern part of the country was being hit by rainstorms, including both sides of the gulf of Thailand, so I couldn’t do any diving and was stuck in Bangkok before defecting to Bali (on the advice of a Russian guy staying at my hostel).

Some positives/negatives during my time there:

1. The SMELL. The entire city smells like sewage.…or like the entire Thai population farted together at one time (negative).
2. The rats. I saw several giant brown ones the size of poodles (the small kind) running down sidewalks before lunging into gaping holes in the concrete, and was thinking to myself that NYC probably has no idea what a real rodent problem is (negative).
3. Khao San Road. I went to party with other backpackers on the infamous Khao San Road, and as soon as I exited my taxi, a literal monsoon hit and started dumping rain on that area of town, threatening to interrupt my festivities while drenching me. As I pivoted in the middle of the street in an attempt to haul ass to cover underneath an overhang on the side of street, I almost ran over a tiny, middle aged Thai woman who appeared out of nowhere and handed me an umbrella. This magical little lady saved the day by getting me a water repellant device in less than exactly 30 seconds after the rain hit, and for the mega friendly price of 100 Baht (3 bucks). I was more than impressed, and thought she might actually be an angel in disguise (positive).
4. Khao San Road. Later that afternoon, I accidentally stepped in a giant rain puddle with both feet while crossing the road to another bar. No, I didn’t see it, and yes, I was drunk. Two days later, I had to purchase and use an anti fungal cream on my feet due to an athlete’s-foot-like fungus that I picked up from the rain puddle. Also, the new pair of $170 Adidas shoes—$200 in today’s dollars when adjusted for inflation—I was stupidly wearing when I stepped in the puddle had to be completely immersed in a bucket of anti fungal liquid, then rinsed off in a swimming pool. They were never the same afterwards (negative).
5. Khao San Road/Thai hospitality. Later that night (early the next morning, actually), I was taken home from probably the seventh bar I’d been to on Khao San during that particular party session by a cute Thai girl who fed me some great Thai food before I drunkenly passed out in her bed. When I woke up the next morning, I was sure that I’d find at least one of my internal organs had been harvested and sold on the black market. But to my surprise, everything, including my kidneys, were intact. She even got me a cab back to my hostel (although she was a little annoyed that I was too hung over to have sex 😆). Try finding that kind of hospitality in your home country (positive).
6. Muay Thai fights. The second night I was in Bankok, I got ringside seats to some professional Muay Thai fights at one of the two large arenas in town for the laughably low price $42. Ever seen a movie featuring martial arts fights set in some third world country where the arena‘s seating areas are divided up into socioeconomic classes: ringside/floor seating for the society’s affluent class, followed next by bleachers for whatever small middle class actually exists in the country, and then a huge nosebleed section cordoned off by a 10 foot high chain link fence behind which a mob of drunk, rowdy lower class guys are holding fistfuls of the local currency while shouting randomly at anyone/everyone/each other and attempting to make bets for or against fighters? This was that. Not kidding. I loved it. And even though every one of the fighters were smaller than the average UFC flyweight, and I’m pretty sure some of them were about 15 years old, out of the eight fights I saw, three ended in knockouts by kick to the head. Two words: Pretty epic. Would definitely go again, and might (positive).

I won’t be spending any more time than necessary in Bankok when I head back to Thailand this summer, except maybe to see a few more glorious Thai fights…..but wondering what other takes/stories people have of it or other cities in Southeast Asia?",Anyone a Bankok fan?,,Huh_questionmark1,,0,4/1/2023 2:41

Our team has learned that the achievement-based education system in Taiwan can limit students' ability to explore their passions and find what is right for them in life and we’re exploring backpacking as a means to help these students develop and find purpose. Our focus is on the impact of backpack traveling on young people, particularly on how it can help build one's sense of self in the world, foster global citizenship, and encourage a sense of responsibility for the world. We hope that our research can help the City Wanderer organization to develop new and exciting programs incorporating backpacking to help more lost youth find purpose and meaning in their lives.

We would really appreciate it if you took 10-20 minutes to fill out the following survey to help us learn about your experiences with backpacking and traveling in Taiwan and abroad! The survey is fully confidential and will only be used by our team for the purposes of this study. There is an option to fill it out in Mandarin and in English depending on your preference.

Thank you for taking the time to help us on our project. We are also looking for backpackers to interview about their experiences so we would appreciate it if you could contact us at the email below if you have any questions about the survey or are interested in helping us more.

您好！我們是Alex、Randy和Abby，來自美國的三位大學生，目前台北與「城市浪人」非營利組織合作進行研究项目，旨在協助臺灣青年找到生命中的目的與意義。我們的團隊發現臺灣的成就導向教育體系可能限制學生探索自己的熱情所在以及生涯方向。因此我們藉由背包旅行，協助這些學生探索和尋找人生目標。我們的研究注重於背包旅行對年輕人的影響，特別是在如何幫助建立個人對世界的認知，培養全球公民意識，並鼓勵青年承担世界责任。我們希望此研究能幫助「城市浪人」開發新穎的計畫，並結合背包旅行，協助更多年輕人找到人生目標與意義。

若您願意花費 10-20 分鐘的時間填以下問卷，幫助我們了解您在臺灣及海外的背包旅行經驗，我們將非常感激。問卷是完全保密的，只會被我們的團隊用於研究。根據您的喜好，問卷有中文和英文版本可供選擇。

感謝您撥冗協助我們的项目。此外，我們還在尋找背包客訪談，如果您有任何問題或有興趣更多協助我們，請透過以下電子郵件聯絡我們：

Jinli, one of the symbols of Chengdu, was restored by the Chengdu Wuhou Temple Museum, and as part of the Wuhou Temple, the street is 550 meters long. Now it is a famous Ming and Qing Dynasty architectural pedestrian street in Chengdu, and it is also the commercial street that can best reflect Chengdu folk customs, which is an antique building in the architectural style of the late Qing Dynasty and early Min, with the Three Kingdoms culture and Sichuan traditional folk culture as the main content. The layout of the ancient street is rigorous and orderly, with bar entertainment area, Sichuan dining and snack area, Fudi inn area, and special tourism handicraft exhibition and sales area. This is one of the most popular attractions in Chengdu for foreign tourists, and it is also a famous food street, and there are so many snacks here that it is simply mouth-watering.

Chengdu belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate, with the characteristics of early spring, hot summer, cool autumn and warm winter, with an average annual temperature of about 16 degrees Celsius, cloudy and foggy, short sunshine time and humid air. The best time to visit Chengdu is: March-June and September-November. In July and August, you can go to Shunan Zhuhai, Qingcheng Mountain, Xiling Snow Mountain, Siguniang Mountain and other places near Chengdu to escape the summer.

I went to a store and after trying on a few models 4 of them stood out to me in terms of comfort and fit.

backpacking,"So last year I did a pilgrimage with a family member, its a 100 km four day trek and I had issues with my knees as it was my first time hiking and I didn't take proper precautions to prevent it. This year im going again and hopefully by myself, and am wondering what backpack would be best for me, but its a jungle and since im walking alone im probably having to go a bit heavier than what i believe was around 10 kg last year. family member carried stuff like sleeping gear.

I prioritize a balance between comfortability in the sense of having everything i need, and walking without too much heavy weight strain on my knees. I have glanced at the Ospreys and other backpacks and wonder how many litres would be appropriate for me, also other input or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated as I'm generally clueless in these departments tbh.

backpacking,"Backpacking solo is one of my favorite things in the world. I realize that for females going on a trip, especially backpacking, can seem pretty daunting. What are some tips you've learned along the way?

A few of mine:

* Always have at least the first night of the hotel booked in any new town you are staying. When you are sleep deprived and jet lagged you can be not as alert as you need to be and the last thing you want to do is stumble around a new city searching for a place to stay that is safe.
* Dress code - a lot of places around the world, women need to be more covered up. Some places they like you to be more modest you can get away with shorts and a tank top but it draws unnecessary attention. Always bring long pants and and long sleeves. When in doubt, I always try to cover up more.
* Have multiple credit cards and debit cards. Keep them in different places. - this goes for everyone.
* Never go out alone at night. Always be with a group. Same for early morning before people are out on the streets. I learned this the hard way in Thailand once.
* If you drink, don't get too messed up with people you just met or at the local bar. If you do drugs.... just don't if you are solo on the other side of the world. If you have to, wait to get back to your hostel to drink more/take anything.
* I've found that each country/location has different scams. Do some research beforehand to get an idea of what you might encounter and need to watch out for.
* Don't wear too much makeup/glam up. I make myself look kind of poor and not very attractive most of the time, unless it's something extra special I have planned. I already stick out like a sore thumb as a blonde white girl, no need to try to more.
* No brand names. It's also a little ridiculous to walk around a 3rd world country with $500 shoes/backpack. I've seen it happening a lot lately on backpacker routes and am always pretty shocked.

Those are just a couple, but I'm wondering what other people have found useful for them.",Tips For Solo Female Backpackers,,Jenneefur1985,,0,3/30/2023 4:39

backpacking,"This subreddit focuses heavily on the positive experiences, but I'm interested in hearing the negatives.

My first trip is two months and it's been full of highs and lows. The lows have come from unexpected places. Observations and experiences that have heavily affected my outlook on the world. I won't talk about some of the worst things, but here are a few that I experienced.

I'm Australian and I've never really seen the homeless problem like I did in the Manila. It was a difficult and emotional experience. I'll always remember the little girl, 8 years old sitting on the side of the highway. She had ragged clothes, no shoes and the worst part? She was holding a little baby in her arms. I saw many other examples of it and I'd never seen anything so sad in my life.

I've been in Japan for about a month now. Something I've learned about backpacking is that the increased amount of time in any location gives you the luxury of actually looking around and observing what's around you, as opposed to standard travelling where you race from one tourist attraction to the next.

One observation I made in Tokyo was the sheer despair that some people exhibited. A young woman of about 24 fell asleep on my shoulder on the train after struggling to stop herself from nodding off for a few minutes. Normally Japanese like to keep away from foreigners on the trains, so it surprised me. I don't know what she was going through, but I could see on her face that it was something very hard.

In Tokyo, I saw so many businessmen that looked on the edge of deaths door. They had the saddest expressions and were deeply tired, worn to the brink. I learned speaking to a Japanese student that most Japanese people don't get any vacation time, and many of them work long hours 6 days a week. I couldn't wrap my head around it. How can anyone live like that in the modern day? When I learned of the work culture, everything I'd seen suddenly had greater significance. 

I visited Hiroshima for obvious reasons, but I truly didn't expect the effect it had on me. I was walking randomly during the night [when I came across this statue](https://i.imgur.com/sVkzyJU.jpg). I didn't need to check. I knew where I was. The scene was especially emotional at night with nobody around. The sheer scale of the tragedy never really hit me like it did when I was standing there and saw the pain with my own eyes. I spent most of my time in Hiroshima just walking around with a massive pain in my chest.

The friends I met along the way, and the ones I've made recently have made these experiences easier to deal with. The trip has been filled with the best experiences of my life, and some dark experiences as well. It's everything I wanted from adventuring. Travelling has made me realise that we really have everything in Australia. Even seemingly advanced countries like Japan are missing many things that we find normal and developing countries are worse off still.",The darker side of travelling the world.,,Zei33,,0,3/29/2023 15:51

Hi guys. My girlfirned and I (both 30, living in Perth) are planning a trip to north east asia to do at some point during 2023.

In the past i have done a 2 month trip in SEA and China (several places in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, KL, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shangai) so I already know a little bit regarding travel distances and considerations specially in China.

Having said that, we want to go mostly new places for both but I dont mind repeating some stuff as everything is awesome. China has blown my mind so I wanna spend around 20 days there, as well as Taipei that is a must and we are really excited to go to.

Main concerns:

* Is going only to Taipei OK if travelling to Taiwan? We saw several other places inside the country but nothing was as appealing as other places of the itinerary.
* Weather for Guilin/Yuangshuo/Zhangiaje. Do they have the same ""good"" season for sighsteeing? I have been fascinated with those places for the past 10 years, but if we go there we really want to minimize the chances of getting bad weather/fog (i remember the fog/cold situation in Ha Long Bay for example).
* Adding South Corea makes sense? With the itinerary detailed below we still have some space to add some stuff or even exchange some days.
* Dates. Which time you think is better to go during 2023? We have no constraints so thats a plus.

Thanks!!

backpacking,"Hello fellow travellers, backpackers and campers. I have a trip in mind that I had a long think about last night and got into a rabbit hole looking at pricing and locations what not. The issue being it’s pretty tough to at first look establish good areas in chosen countries with good access via public transport. 

TLDR: Destinations with wilderness areas accessible fairly easily via public transport from nearest airport for 4 day bivi camp trip. 

I was picking up unbelievably low priced flights to Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and many others with great rules for outdoor backpacking/bivi camping, my issue is finding a good spot where myself and my friend could take 3-4 days hiking around the wilderness and staying in our bivis away from civilisation that is however accessible by air then train.

So my question is, has anyone done a European trip like this where you backpack on the flight over, train or bus to an area, do your planned trip then returned back? If so, please send destination ideas! Ideally an area that isn’t going to break the bank getting public transport out to it from the airport. I would absolutely love to hear of your experiences, any unforeseen issues you may have come across that you’d not considered previous to the trip and any advice with planning/executing a trip like this!

Its very hard for me to talk about this situation as it is very recent and still happening right now but things like that should be heard and I hope it will spread awarness. 
Recently I was attacked while walking home in Tulum, Mexico. It was night. I thought i would save up money for the taxi as it was only 1km to go and whoever visited Tulum knows how crazy expencive taxis are here. I thank God I had strenght not to lose conciousness while my head was smashed against the ground multiple times and was able to stand up when I had a chance to run and survive. I thank God I had someone to take me to the hospital as I woudnt even know where to go or how to speak in spanish at that time and condition. And I pray everyday I will find the right way to heal and rise up from where I am now mentally and physically.

backpacking,"Hello friends and travelers!

My partner and I are taking our 3 year old Australian shepherd in our Subaru Outback on a 3 week trip from south west Florida to Los Angeles California.  

The trip coincides with us moving cross country as well, but after eliminating all unnecessary stuff we are managing to fit everything on our roof, on a hitch, and in our trunk with plenty of room to spare. 

Over the course of trip, we plan to spend as much time possible taking in nature and hikes and rivers and valleys and mountains and so on and so forth as much as possible. We only plan to stop in cities for more groceries and an occasional dinner out.  Yay nature!

We plan to utilize our coolers and food prep;  Sleep in our car; And be outdoors as much as possible where it’s safe and accessible for our dog.  

This is where we need help/advice.  The trip starts April 18th and ends around May 9th. 

We definitely want to go to Colorado, and the Grand Canyon.   But asides from that we don’t really know.  We want to see greenery and flowers and color more so than dessert and rock.  And we’d also be happy checking out a large festival or event or something. But we’d generally like to avoid city activities.  

And between north Florida/Chattanooga area to Colorado, we aren’t sure at all what to look at.

backpacking,"Hello all,

Some friends and I went backpacking a couple of years ago at an be altitude of about 8,600 ft (we live at about 2,500ft). That is a pretty tame altitude differential, so I'd not thought it would be an issue. However, one of my friends had a very difficult time with it given his level of fitness and sustaining what sounds to have been severe lung scarring when he was a kid. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach to planned destination (we were all alright with this, as the main goal was to just hang out).

He is open to trying it again, and we've been periodically doing some short rucks in our area to help build up to it. Aside from low-altitude fitness conditioning, is there anything else we can do to help him get ready for it? From having gone to Breckenridge for skiing I know some things like drinking a bunch of water and not drinking alcohol in the couple days before the trip would be a good idea, but I'm looking for any other recommendations that could help him (either as far as training goes, or short-term stuff like the hydration and no alcohol).

backpacking,"Hi everyone!

I wanted to share my experience with GlobeSisters - a hospitality exchange platform tailored for women-identifying folks like myself. As someone who loves to travel and explore new cultures, it has been an amazing resource for me.

One of the best things about the platform is that all of the hosts are women-identifying and ID-checked, which gives me peace of mind when I'm travelling alone. During my travels, I've had the opportunity to stay with hosts in different parts of the world, and it's been an incredible way to immerse myself in local cultures.

This platform has also allowed me to save money on accommodation, which is always a plus when you're travelling on a budget. Not only that, but I've made some amazing connections with the hosts I've stayed with and have even formed lifelong friendships. I highly recommend it to any female traveller looking for trusted accommodation solutions.

We're not that keen on too crowded trails so we've been looking at other trails than Everest base camp and Annapurna Circuit.

I've narrowed it down to these three but would like some feedback on what would be the best option to also have sufficient time for exploring the rest of Nepal.

Manaslu circuit. Looks super interesting and varied in nature. Was not too keen on having to bring a guide but it seems like you can't trek without a guide from this year onward. Mainly worried about the length of the trek being too long for us to see anything else.

Khopra Ridge. Seems to fit the bill length wise, nature wise, and crowd wise, but I'm worried that it will be too easy compared to other treks - even when adding the Khayer lake at 4600m. We want a challenge when we're in the freaking Himalayas. Will this be challenging?

Everest three passes trek. Now this is a challenge and maybe even a bit too much. It seems like the bare minimum is 17 days and you need to factor in possible delays. The views look amazing though. Are they worth it even if it means seeing less of the rest of Nepal?

backpacking,"So I was a US Marine for 8 years.

You get it, HEAVY AF. We would march up to 20 miles a day in column or ranger file. 

I say all that not as any kind of flex because I firmly believe the military genuinely needs to hike that way. It’s not recreational. I learned how to evenly distribute weight in my pack, where to optimal wear my hip belt, etc.

I guess I need to vent a bit, I don't know why I'm so annoyed, but I have close friends who recently started traveling as their financial situation is really good right now, and I'm happy for them. I've been traveling for many years, mostly backpacking, didn't always have money to spend but I'd make it work by staying in the dingiest hostels just to see things. 

The thing is, they will take a 10 hour flight and then not really see anything. They went to Tunisia and not even once they tried local food. It had to be all European restaurants. They came to visit me in North America (I live in a big city) and didn't want to  walk or see anything, they rented a car and wanted to drive everywhere (you can't experience or see a city in a car). I wanted to introduce them to some new fun foods, they only wanted McDonalds or something theyve seen in a movie. Then they've decided to explore other places and basically drove for hours, stopped in another city for the evening, go out for food and drinks, drive to yet another city the next day, rinse and repeat. Thousands and thousands of dollars spent. No walking, no museums, no history, no cuisines, no exploring of any kind. Just driving through Midwest trying to tick off as many cities as possible without actually really seeing a single one. Their social media are full of amazing, nicely edited photos that paint a picture of them as these globetrotters.

 And I don't even know why I'm annoyed, i shouldn't give a shit but it seems.... wasteful? Like going to a restaurant and having a chef make you a meal and then you take a picture of it and don't even eat it or try it properly but you'll tell people you've been to that restaurant and tasted the food.",Why do people spend shit tons of money on travel and decide not to see anything?,,Princess_Terror,,0,3/23/2023 4:05

hi, i recently booked myself a month and a half long trip to europe. i plan to backpack from london, to paris, to dublin and back to london. maybe add in one more city….

my issue is, because of grad school and covid i haven’t backpacked in a while… i am in pretty good health, but i have knees that like to give out sometimes and have to use a walking stick most days. 

so. any advice on if i should actually “backpack” (use a backpack as my luggage) or should i invest in a rolling carry on? i think both have their pros and cons…

the rolling carry on seems VERY cumbersome if/WHEN i have to navigate steps. 
but also, the extra weight on my back could make it more likely for my knees to give out?

The only problem is that it can be challenging to properly attach a tumpline to quality large-capacity backpacks.  A tumpline has to be secured at the bottom of the load so that the straps meet your head at the proper angle, and with most backpacks there isn't a good way to attach straps to the sides down at the bottom.  So I'm forced to use a pack frame, which I don't really care for.

I've found lots of threads on shooting/self defense forums where guys are complaining about hip straps, so I know it's not just me.  Their solutions are pretty stupid, usually involving pocket carrying little subcompacts they can't even shoot, or using drop leg holsters that don't conceal the weapon and don't allow the weight to secure to the hips properly.  Tumplines are the superior solution here in my opinion because you can carry and conceal full size gear on your hip without changing your EDC/CCW system at all.  Backpack companies need to pay attention and start producing tumpline packs or making them tumpline-compatible, because right now they're competing against no-name Chinese pack frames off Amazon for the CCW American market.",Why don't people use tumplines?

But I don't want to travel alone. As all my friends either have kids or can't get much time off work I don't really have anyone to travel with.

So I'm wondering if anyone might be open to that idea? Whether for a few days or few weeks it doesn't matter. 

I'm still working out the details but the idea would be you'll travel with me in the van but sleep in a separate tent. You'll still have access to the on board toilet at night and the bathroom and kitchen during the day. (I'm also thinking about getting a few ebikes to ride). From there we can use it as a base camp and go on hiking or biking trips.

Money wise - you'll buy your own food. We would split fuel and accommodation costs. (But the van will be off grid capable so we would just stay at free camp sites.)

(I'm asking now because I have to decide between getting the single cab 3 seater or the dual cab 7 seater).

\- I'm solo travelling (have done this in SEA before so not a total newbie)

\- Staying in hostels is a preference

\- Ideally I want to travel via buses and trains rather than car (although I've heard this can be challenging in the US?)

\- I'm keen to check out at least one national park

\- One route I have looked at is Vancouver - Seattle - Portland - San Fran - Yosemite - etc

I’m returning home from a trip to the Amazon near Iquitos, Peru. While there, I have been bit by what I think are bed bugs and as a result I’m concerned that the bed bugs made their way on to my clothes and in my luggage. From what I hear, the consequences of bringing bed bugs home can be quite irritating and costly, so I am looking for routes to avoid spreading them into my home. 

I read online the best way to kill the bed bugs once I return home is to wash my belongings with detergent on a high heat setting and then tumble dry on a high heat setting, but my issue with this is that much of my belongings (clothes, backpack, etc.) would get damaged by the high heat. As a result, I’m looking for alternatives. One alternative I found is to dry clean my belongings to kill the bed bugs them. My plan as of now is to wash and tumble dry on high heat the clothes that can withstand the high heat, and I’ll take the remaining clothes and belongings to the dry cleaner.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a quick introduction, this post is about any advice the veteran travellers would have for me as a 19-year-old first-time solo female autistic traveller! My autism is high functioning but I do get overwhelmed by busy environments and lots of people easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am competent, confident, have good common sense and will not be a liability when travelling: I am sensible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to the Philippines in June for 40 days. 10 days of that will be an organised tour at the beginning and for 7 days I will be staying with family in Leyte. For around 20 days I will be alone. The tour ends in Coron so my plan is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Coron--&gt; Siquijor--&gt;Bohol--&gt;Moalboal--&gt;Boracay--&gt;Malay--&gt;Rombolon??? --&gt; Tacloban--&gt; Southern Leyte with family --&gt; Manilla.

&amp;#x200B;

Please could any of you kind people advise me on the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The optimal blend of flexibility with my plans and pre-booking? As in set dates for certain destinations and pre-booking tours or just go with the flow and make it up as I go along. I don't want to overschedule and things to be too rigid. 

\-The likelihood I may meet new people and which areas would be best to do so

\- Areas/tours that are best to avoid as they are too western or packed e.g a nice attraction that is too commercialised and no longer enjoyable.

\-Essential things to pack

\- Any anecdotes, tips or tricks that could be helpful perhaps about your experiences solo travelling

\- If I should add or take anything away from my itinerary 

(Ideally, I want a mix of going to sociable places and then going somewhere remote to zen out but where I may not feel too lonely - so not exclusive couple resorts where I won't meet anyone lol)

\-And lastly, any must-see places or things to experience!

I don't mind staying in hostels at all but I will not want to stay in shared dorms and I am iffy on shared bathrooms too. I want to travel for a relatively cheap amount but budget is not particularly an issue as I have saved a few thousand.

Thank you so much for reading this far. I tried to lay it out clearly but I apologise if it is a torrent of information. Any advice on travel between those places would be particularly helpful too!

backpacking,"Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster. 

I'll be taking 6 months off my job in April to travel, and will be using the first \~1.5 months of my time to backpack through Western Europe. I've done a LOT of research on where to go / what to do but wanted to post here to get some feedback on my itinerary, get suggestions on activities / places, and see if anyone had recommendations on a backpack.

A little about myself, I'm 25M living in NYC who basically travels for a living (took 50 flights last year), so lots of experience with travel but have never really been to Western Europe before. I enjoy all sports (but mainly basketball and football), food, people watching, comedy, poker, ancient history, amateur photography and any unique / quirky experiences. I'm a decent fan of nightlife too and plan to be indulging in it at a moderate rate during my trip. Not the biggest museum / historical person but planning to hit some of the most famous ones. Will be staying in hostels for most of the trip with the occasional hotel or two to break it up. Looking to do the whole trip for about $7500.

Now, on to my itinerary. I'll be in Europe for 47 days total, with the following rough plan (in order):

* London (5 days)
* Paris (4 days)
* Amsterdam (4 days)
* Berlin (4 days)
* Prague (2 days)
* Vienna (2 days)
* Venice (3 days)
* Bologna (3 days)
* Florence (4 days)
* Rome (5 days)
* Sanremo (3 days - local poker tournament)
* Milan (2 days)
* Ibiza (2 days)
* Barcelona (2 days)
* Paris (2 days + flight back to NYC)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on to my main questions

* Itinerary
   * Is my current itinerary too much? Worried I won't have enough down time, even though I plan to lay pretty low in Prague / Vienna and in Sanremo
   * Given my current itinerary, any suggestions on activities that would be fun to do / places to stay / things to see? I've got a hostel booked for London and Ibiza but nothing else yet.
* Backpack
   * I'm planning to get a \~30L backpack to use on the trip, one that can be used as a carry on for Norse Atlantic / Ryannair tipe flights, with a fanny pack serving as my daypack. I've done a lot of research on bags, looking to get one under $200 but can't settle on anything so would greatly appreciate any recommendations.

backpacking,"Hey everyone, 

I have used Lighterpack for a while, but really wanted a way to create a list of items I was bringing on a trip to see base weight without having to re-add items to a new list. So I created my own list as a Coda doc. It allows you to create a database of your items with their weight (g, lb, kg or oz). Then you can add those items to your ""Pack"" to see what items you are bringing for a specific trip and the total weight.

You can check it out here. [**https://coda.io/@ben-peine/camping-equipment-list**](https://coda.io/@ben-peine/camping-equipment-list) Copy the doc to be able to use it for your own gear.

The problem is that I want to use it as my personal carry on for a Spirit Airlines flight. I know for a fact it’s too big. Matter of fact, every backpack I have ever brought onto a flight has been too big to be a personal item, but I’ve never been charged. This one however is long and looks bigger due to the air mesh back panel. What are my odds of getting away with it? It’s an extra $30USD ($100 vs $68) to carry on it at the counter each way. So the way I see it, if I have a 50% shot at it, I’m gonna try to pass it. If not, ill have to put the empty pack in my checked bag and use a different pack as my carry on.

backpacking,"My boyfriend and I are going on our first backpacking trip in Europe this summer and I don't know what to buy for my handbag. We are going to move a lot: Spain, France, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia, Turkey and Egypt. So, my boyfriend and I each bought a backpack to bring our stuff on the airplanes as carry ons (Cabin Zero Classic 36L). My problem is that I need a daypack to carry the essentials for when I will leave my backpack at my hostel when I won't be traveling to the next country on that day. 

I looked up to some blogs but I didn't seem to find quite what I am looking for, hence why I am asking here. I want a bag that can contain my phone, my passport, a snack, my Airpods, my wallet and if possible, my water bottle (asking to experienced backpackers: how do you bring  water around??). I also want it to be as fashionable and as small as possible, since I won't bring another bag and I could go clubbing and raving, to a restaurant, to a museum, or just walking in the city with it. It needs to be safe (I heard that you need to watch for pickpockets) also. I don't know if I am asking for an impossible bag but I wish it could fit with my aesthetic. I really love brutalist, minimalist, East European fashion - think techno music, that's pretty much it. I saw the Nike sling bag on Pinterest and it sparked my attention, but I worry it might be too big. On the reviews I read, I only found crossbody cute bags that are really not my vibe or hiking things. I would like to find a middle ground that fit a techno music lover!

I don't quite know if a crossbody bag, fanny pack or (small to medium) sling bag would be the best in my situation. It also needs to be easy to carry for the days when I do have to travel with my backpack (I'm not quite fond of the reversed small backpack look, so I'm not very much looking for that either). I think that a fanny pack or sling bag would be the best since clubbing while keeping a hand on a crossbody purse so it doesn't bump everything or get stolen is not very fun, but I am once again asking for the advice of wiser than me. 

To make it short:

\- What size of bag would I need to carry my essentials during the day?

\- What kind of bag would be the best (sling bag, fanny pack, etc.) in my situation? 

\- What bag do you recommend?

\- How do I carry water around? Water bottle recommendations that would maybe fit?

Planning a trip to Jammu &amp; Kashmir in a few months time as part of a larger journey around India and I'm after the opinion of some people who have been there recently on how safe it is.

From what I can gather online, it seems to be fine for travellers at the moment. Whilst there is a risk of flare ups and unrest, it looks stable currently and a lot of people travel there and have a great, trouble free time. (I might be way off though - hence asking!)

The UK Foreign Office advises against travel in the region though, and many first hand sources I've found are a few years out of date - so I'd really appreciate any thoughts from people who have been there recently.

My plan is to travel from Dharamsala to Jammu, then Jammu up to Srinagar by bus, also staying in a couple of places like Gulmarg and Pahalgam.

I'm a younger backpacker still getting used to the time scale of planning to get permits for some of the more popular backpacking spots. My permit for end of March backpacking the Grand Canyon was just denied as all the spots are filled. The email included a section about permits being issued from cancellations plus a small number of Corridor campsites are held in reserve for last minute walk-in visitors.

I was wondering if anyone has experience knowing about the likelihood of getting one of these last min permits? Or even better if anyone has tips on great backpacking trips (1-3 nights) for a last minute planner in the Flagstaff / Sedona area?

backpacking,"Sorry for the long post - I’m not even sure if this is the right thread - but I would really appreciate some advice/perspective 

TLDR worried I’ll regret temporarily leaving my partner behind and quitting my job to travel SEA with a friend for 3-4 months. Anxiety about this is becoming debilitating and making me want to cancel my trip. 

Over the last year or so myself and a friend (both 24F) have been planning a backpacking trip around SEA for around 3 months. I’ve always dreamt of this type of longer term travel and up until more recently I’ve been so excited about all the new cultures and adventures I’ll get to experience and see. 

I had to delay the trip as I was on a long wait list for surgery, in the meantime, I’ve gotten into a relationship which I’ve now been in for around 7 months. 

Before we got together I made it clear that I had plans to travel with my friend in the near future. He understood it would be difficult but never tried to stop me going, and assured me he will wait for me and that he even hopes to visit for two or three weeks during our trip.

Cut to now and I had my surgery last month, so planning for our trip is in full swing. We’re aiming to jet off in May, but now it’s becoming real, everyday I’m struck with anxiety and dread about this trip I was once so excited about. 

I know it’s mostly because I will miss my SO. We’re still in a very exciting part of our relationship and I’m sad that it will be put on hold for a few months. I have FOMO about the things I will miss with him over the summer. I can’t help but feel super guilty about leaving and I’m even worried I will no longer enjoy the trip due to missing him and feeling bad doing all these exciting things whilst leaving him behind. There’s also the fear that although currently he’s 100% confident he will wait, that all this time apart will ultimately be too difficult whilst he is stuck at home in the same routine without me.

He is the best partner I’ve ever had, he makes happy every day, I can see a future with him without a doubt. I fear travelling puts that at risk and I would not want to go if it meant the end. 
Is it more common than I think, for someone to travel for a longer period of time without their partner? Or am I stupid for thinking this could work? My travel friend is single so I’m struggling to relate to anyone. 

Work wise, my marketing job only offered me 1 month career break, so I will have to resign. I enjoy the job very much - it offers hybrid working, 30 days annual leave, plus bank holidays, PLUS almost two weeks off for Christmas. However the role doesn’t offer much progression - so I would likely end up leaving after the next year or two anyway. But I do worry I will be worse off finding a job when I return.

I’m starting to appreciate more the happy life I have at home - this comfy job - a great group of friends - festivals, weekends trips and holidays - being around family - my flourishing new relationship. At the moment the only thing that makes me feel better is the thought of coming home and everything being the same, but I’m worried everything is going to change.

On the other hand, I think a couple months long distance should not mean the end of a relationship. We plan to spend our lives together, so in the grand scheme of things it is a very short time. I should not give up this dream because of my fears that might not even come true. I would be stupid to drop out my chance to do this and if I did, it would be a life regret. But if it meant the end of this relationship, or an unenjoyable trip at the cost of my job and thousands of pounds, that could be another huge regret. 

There’s also the aspect of massively letting down my friend if I don’t go, I would feel so awful to ruin her dreams too, she would have waited for my surgery for nothing.

I feel incredibly ungrateful to be able to do what many only dream of and not feel excited about it. Ultimately I now feel fear instead of excitement. It makes it so difficult to muster up the energy and motivation to plan or buy anything I need to go ahead with it.

I don’t know if it’s worth the turmoil of quitting my job and putting a strain on my new relationship, when I’m not even sure I’m going to be able to enjoy it now. Is this just pre travel jitters now the trip is becoming real? Maybe I should just take the month and see how it goes?

I don’t think people tend to regret travelling? Many have told me go for it, and people that have gone have told me it’s the best thing they ever did, but they were not in relationships. 

Some days I feel so positive and excited about it, like the best case scenario is entirely possible, but usually that only lasts a few hours before the scaries come creeping back. 

Am I letting my anxieties get the better of me? Are these normal feelings before a trip? Or is this a sign this is not for me? Do I just go ahead and do it scared sh*tless? Or is that a recipe for disaster? Am I completely overthinking everything because in reality we’re specs on a massive floating rock in outer space? Probably?!

backpacking,"Spent two nights at a backpack site at Split Rock State Park on the north shore of Lake Superior. On our first full day a winter storm warning was issued and we got to watch the storm come in from the south. It was beautiful, but a couple hours into the storm the high wind off the lake and heavy snow were making it too difficult to maintain the fire so we went inside the tent and played cards until we fell asleep. We woke up the next morning with about a foot of snow surrounding our tent with the storm still raging. The storm then waited until we were close to being ready to hike out to really pick up and we were battered by 30-40mph wind gusts coming off the lake. After a tough hike back to the car pulling sleds through high snow drifts and deep snow we made it back to the car relieved to see a park employee had been plowing non-stop. He let us know the highway was almost un-drivable with white out snow conditions and unplowed drifts over a foot or two on the roads. He wasn’t lying and the drive was terrifying. I wouldn’t change this trip for the world and feel so much gratitude to be able to have experienced that storm in such a remote place.

backpacking,"BLUF; this year I attempted and failed to get an early access reservation on Recreation.gov for wilderness backpacking around Rainier. Of course, it came with a $6 fee just to apply that I'm learning is nonrefundable. 

$6 is not much, and I don't even care about the money. What gets me is that you're literally gambling to get the chance to pay more money to do something wholesome like backcountry camping. Add to that the fact that the lottery application fee goes straight to the private contractor that redesigned recreation.gov and it leaves a really bitter taste in my mouth. I would gladly let the parks department keep that money since they're pitifully funded as-is. 

I understand there's a lawsuit about this - maybe something will come of it. 

https://www.rvtravel.com/federal-lawsuit-seeks-halt-and-restitution-of-wrongful-fees-charged-by-recreationgov-rvt-1093b/

In the end, I just think the system could be designed better. Either give the lottery fees directly to the parks dept., refund the lottery fees for applicants that aren't successful or apply the fee to the base cost of a permit (i.e. permit minus the six dollar application fee). Any of these options would make me feel better. 

At the end of the day, it just feels like a big F U to people who really enjoy the outdoors when you're basically paying some shady third party KTR to be considered for the chance use public land. Stings worse when you're turned away and they keep your money.

backpacking,"My partner is 34, turning 35 this year. It was always his dream to visit Australia and New Zealand, and some new WHV visa changes with the UK means that we can actually both go now. 

Both countries differ slightly in their conditions and allowances.  From what I can see;

In Australia (once the changes come into effect), you can apply up to the day before your 36th birthday, then have a year to enter (so just before your 37th birthday in theory).You can apply for year 2 or 3 as well, providing you are not over 35 when applying. Under these rules, we can get my partner a stay of 1 year. 

In New Zealand, you can also apply up to 35 now. This arrangement has been finalised and will be in effect by July this year. Unlike Australia, you can apply for a 23 month WHV right off the bat, guaranteeing my partner and myself almost 2 years instead of one. From what I understand, you can also extend this to 3 years after 23 months, provided you’re extending your current WHV. The extension doesn’t seem age based unlike Australia, but rather location based (you must be in NZ on a WHV when applying for the extension). Unlike Australia, if your WHV expires, you can’t leave and come back for another year with a new application. 

Having a base in NZ for 3 years would be amazing, and we can apply for it much sooner than the AUS one. Would it be okay to do that, but travel to Australia for a working holiday break while based in NZ on their WHV scheme? As 2 different countries I don’t imagine our visas for one would affect the other, and surely other working holiday makers have visited both on their trips. I know you can comfortably leave both and re-enter on your visa no problem, so as far as I can see we should be ok. 

As my partner is almost 35, that limits us in travel opportunities in a way the WHV is just perfect for. The NZ option would allow us to enter when he’s almost 37 and stay until he’s almost 40. But we’d also like to take hop over to Australia and do some travel/ casual work there.

Do you think this is possible? If not, why not?

The only thing I can imagine is that if we leave for a whole year, it might be an issue.

* Decent local logistics (e.g. not interested in a 3-day jeep journey just to get to the trailhead)
* Prefer dispersed (if allowed) as opposed to staying at pre-designated spots only

I arrive into Nepal on March 20th, and was really looking forward to doing some solo-trekking.

This news totally scuppered my plans, but no I'm hoping it might not be so bad.

Firstly, the Everest area doesn't require a TIMS card - does this mean that solo trekking is still allowed there?

Secondly, if I pick up my TIMS card before April 1st, does that mean that I can still solo-trek after the deadline? Is the deadline a deadline for picking up the TIMS card, or is it a deadline for actually any hiking whatsoever?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, finally, could someone inform me of how the TIMS card works.. do I need to buy one for the whole trip, even if I want to do 3 treks, or do I need a new TIMS card for each trek?",Solo Trekking ban in Nepal..,,shayhtfc,,0,3/10/2023 20:24

I am an American living in Europe. There is no shortage of beautiful mountains here, but I am missing the wildness of back home. What I'd really like to find is an area where I can hike and sleep in my tent, preferably with as few other people as possible ... no offense :)

 I hiked the GR20 in Corsica last summer - it was really beautiful, but the areas where we could camp were always completely packed, with lines for the bathrooms, or to fill up water, etc. So I'm hoping to find something not quite so crowded.

Other possibilities I've heard of are the Kungsleden in Sweden, or the West Highland Way in Scotland, or Laugavegur in Iceland. I think there are plenty more GRs in France where camping is allowed - but if someone can confirm that, or recommend relatively untravelled favorites, that would be awesome.

1. Free Walking Tour:  
 Free walking tours in Paris are a great way to explore the city and learn about its history, culture, and landmarks without spending any money. These tours are typically led by knowledgeable and passionate local guides who provide an in-depth look at the city's most famous sights and hidden gems. They are generally offered on a ""pay-what-you-like"" basis, which means you can decide how much to tip your guide at the end of the tour based on your experience.  
 The tours usually cover famous areas such as the Marais, Montmartre, the Latin Quarter, and the Champs-Élysées. They often start at a central location, such as Notre Dame Cathedral or the Louvre Museum, and take you on a journey through the city's streets, squares, and landmarks. You will learn about the history of Paris, including the city's architecture, art, its culture, and famous figures.  
 Some free walking tours in Paris also offer themed tours, such as a food tour, a literary tour, or a ghost tour. These are a great way to delve deeper into a specific aspect of the city's culture.  
 
2. Visit the Museums  
 Many of Paris' most famous museums offer free admission at certain times or on specific days of the week. Museums like The Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, and Centre Pompidou offer free admission for everyone under the age of 18 and for EU citizens and residents under the age of 26. They offer completely free admission on the first Sunday of every month from October to March to everyone.  
 Another great way to visit Paris museums for free is by visiting the city's many smaller museums. Many of these museums are lesser known but just as exciting and informative as the larger ones. Some examples include the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, the Musée des Arts et Métiers, and the Musée national des Arts asiatiques Guimet.  
 Even if you are not eligible for free admission, many museums offer discounted tickets for students, seniors, and other groups. It's also a good idea to check the museum's website or contact them in advance to confirm the free admission hours and days.  
 
3. See the Eiffel Tower Sparkle at Night  
 The view of the sparkling Eiffel tower is magical and you can see it for free. During the illumination hours, the lights are turned on for five minutes every hour, from sunset until 1 am. You can also see the tower from several places in the city, such as the Trocadero or the Champ de Mars. These places offer great views of the tower and the light show. You can also take a walk along the Seine River bank and enjoy the view of the tower from a distance.  
 You can also see the Eiffel Tower sparkle for free by visiting the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. This park is located in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, and from the top of the hill, you can get a great view of the Eiffel Tower. It is lovely during the illumination hours and a great spot to enjoy a picnic while taking in the view.  
 Visiting the Eiffel Tower during the day is free, but you have to pay to go to the top or take the elevator. However, you can still see the tower and take pictures from the base and the surrounding area.  
 
4. Attend a Free Concert  
Attending free concerts in Paris is a great way to experience the city's vibrant music scene without breaking the bank. Paris has a rich musical heritage and a variety of venues that offer free concerts throughout the year.  
One of the best places to attend free concerts is at the Philharmonie de Paris. The Philharmonie is a modern concert hall located in the Parc de la Villette and offers free concerts regularly. These concerts feature a wide range of music, from classical to jazz, and are open to the public.  
Parisian churches also have recitals often that you can attend for free. Churches like Notre Dame Cathedral have Gregorian Chant on Sunday morning, St. Eustache church has free organ recital on Sundays from 5:30PM and so on. L'Officiel des Spectacles, which comes out every Wednesday has concert listings that always include free concerts, and the venues change from week to week.  
 
5. Free gardens in Paris:  
Paris is home to many beautiful gardens that offer free admission. With plenty of green spaces, fountains, and sculptures to admire, they're the perfect place to relax and soak in the Parisian atmosphere. Bring your picnic blanket and some French Baguette and cheese, and voilà! You got yourself a romantic Parisian picnic.  
 Luxembourg Garden, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, Parc Montsouris, Bois de Vincennes, and Bois de Boulogne are some of the most beautiful parks you can visit for free.

I'm a side/stomach sleeper and won't be doing much winter camping, but will be in the shoulder seasons. Is there any significant difference in comfort/warmth/durability of the Air Core Ultra vs the Q-Core deluxe since the Air Core is so much cheaper? Also are there any other pads you'd recommend? Noise is also fairly important to me, so the quieter the better.

Also, two 25"" pads won't fit in my tent, so do you find the larger side baffles of the BA pads combat the narrow 20"" feel?",Big Agnes Sleeping Pads Recommendations,,l33tdiver,,0,3/8/2023 21:12

Hi!

I am reading from April you will be forced to have a guide in Nepal for trekking.

We are 2 months into travelling and are heading to Nepal early April to do AC. We were looking forward to doing this at our own pace and only really needed a guide for the pass. 

Does anyone know how this will be enforced or what to do? We cannot afford to budget for a guide on this trek for the time we wanted to take and I am with many other travellers who feel the same. 

This is really upsetting for us as we have been wanting to do this trip for years and the rules have changed at the exact moment we were due to start.",terrible new Nepal rules.,,dellwho,,0,3/8/2023 12:13

backpacking,"Hey guys/girls, 

I am new to Reddit so I don't know about how this works. Let's say I am a big picky person and before making a purchase I tend to overanalyze what I want and what I need. I wanted a big backpack for **college (Architecture**) that could fit all my stuff: **laptop, iPad, wires, pouch with craft tools (knife, tape, glue), mouse, an A5 sketchbook, and a few everyday essentials such as hand cream, wallet, earbuds, etc...** Since I wanted to carry so much stuff I opted for a 28L to 30L (approx) backpack. I liked the idea of a separated pocket for my laptop and fell in love with the commodity of the arness &amp; back cushioned support of the North Face Borealis. I also chose this bag for the aesthetics. 

I had this backpack for a few weeks and there are some flaws that made me want to change to a new one:

1st. The look of the bag when packed. I noticed that even if I put just my notebook and a few pencils in the small pocket with organizers in the front, this part of the back tends to project over the bottom, giving the bag a really weird shape. It happens independently if the bag is lightly or fully packed.

(I put a link of a girl in TikTok with the same problem)

2n. Even if I use poches to store my goodies, these end up badly pilled up and makes impossible to access something from the bottom without taking all the other pouches out. 

Considering this, I was looking for other backpacks that will overcome this flaws, but I need some advice. 

I like the look of the *Patagonia Black Hole 32l*, but it doesn't look sturdy but too flexible and I'm worried my laptop could be damaged and also that it wont be as comfortable as the Borealis when carrying it.

I like the organization options of the *Osprey backpacks (Tropos, Nebula)*... but I'm not sure if I really like the aesthetics of the design.

Then, I finally considered buying a clamshell like backpack, thus it would be easier to access every thing I need without the necessity of taking out all other stuff.

I will be so glad if you could give me some ideas of backpacks that would fit my demands and why they will. 

Ohh!! I'm buying the new bag from Spain, so shipping to this country should be available (and cheap :) ). 

Thanks!!!!

backpacking,"Hello /r/backpacking 

As the title says I'm planning to travel the world in only 2.5 weeks and still need a backpack fit for my needs. The plan is to only take a 40L backpack with me so I can fly comfortably with only hand luggage.
  
I also plan to take my MBP 2019 16' with me and maybe a little digital camera, so I need a backpack fit for digital nomads. I heard a ton of good things about the Nomatic (Gomatic) 40L travel bag but also quite a few bad things so I'm unsure if it's the right choice. 

I plan to travel SEA (Japan, S. Korea, China + HK, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, maybe Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines), Australia/NZ, and the whole of LATAM and maybe Canada at the end. I'll be mainly staying in hostels in cities but there is also a high possibility for me to be staying in a tent on some days when going to hike for multiple days. I also plan to travel whole countries by bus if possible and if not by airplane or ferry.  
  
I do like the idea of having a system like the Nomatic travel bag with a separate laundry bag and all the things separated as I'm a rather chaotic person. I'm 176cm, about 65kg if that helps. 

Things I need to pack are roughly those mentioned: 

- Shirts
- At least one hoodie
- At least one pair of long pants and two shorter ones
- Slim but warm jacket for cold days (start temperature will be around 0-10 degrees celsius)
- Underwear
- Maybe a smaller bag for daily activities
- Shoes for hiking
- MacBook Pro 2019 16' 
- Cables for phone and MBP 
- Hygiene stuff and drugs for emergencies
- Medication I need to take 
- Documents   
  
That's the rough list of things I need to have with me.   
  
I'll be travelling for approx. 1 year but it can extend to up to 2.5 years.

My only thought is that maybe the goats could have stolen them? Otherwise it would have to be a person.

Either way, I'm not really sure what to do now. The nearest shoe store is miles away over rocky/gravel terrain, but I guess that's my only option.

backpacking,"**You can visit free places and they are all amazing. You don’t have to sacrifice fun for money.**

If you want to watch it as a video, visit the link in my profile. I have a youtube channel.

1. **Explore Ko Kret Island**

Ko kret is an artificial island in Chao Phraya River, just northwest of central Bangkok city. It is equipped with everything one needs to be entertained in a low budget.

You can go there any day of the week but the weekends are spectacular when many vendors sell food, local pottery, and various random things. Although you wanna keep it within a budget, it is for sure that you’ll spend more money on some mouth watering food and beautiful looking pots. You can plan to spend an entire day in there if your stay in Bangkok is long enough, but you can also get around the island within 5 to 6 hours if you want to keep it short.

If you have enough time, I recommend you to visit the other parts of the island as well. You never know what you’ll come across. It’s less visited than the main market, so it’s peaceful and a way to directly mingle with the local people and experience their day to day lives.

Only way of reaching Ko kret is through boats which you can get from Nonthaburi Pier. You pass through beautiful Wat Sanam Nuea temple to get to the Pier. Ride is almost 15 to 20 minutes and it will cost you maximum of 5 bhats, it’s incredibly cheap if you convert it to USD, like 15 cents.

**2. Get lost at the Chatuchak Weekend Market**

It is one of the largest market in Asia, the biggest in Thailand. It has more than 15000 stalls, just imagine how big it is. Either you wanna spend tons of money on shopping, or you wanna kill time but see Thai culture without spending a dime, for both things it can be your go to place.

The whole market is open from 9am to 6pm on weekends. On other days it’s partially open. You can find everything from plants, antiques, consumer electronics, cosmetics, fresh and dry food and drinks, ceramics, anything you can think about. There are wholesalers and retailers for almost every items and the best thing is, they ship directly to your address. They charge you an extra shipping fee, but you don’t have to bother carrying bags for the whole day, right?

Their street foods are fantastic. Try as many street foods as you can. they are cheap and also give the authentic local taste of Thailand.

You can get here by train, taxi, metro, Tuk tuk; it’s famous locally, it’s like an Auto, or by bus. There’s a website that explains in detail about how to get there, it’s mentioned in the description below, make sure to check it.

Some more tips while visiting the market; try to start the visit early in the morning because it’s gonna be crowded during the mid-day. Also wear comfy clothes as you have to walk through the market, probably all day. Get some cash and remember to bargain. Although the prices are already cheap, you can get them for around 70% to 80% less than the marked price. Also be safe of thieves as it is a crowded place, and keep your belongings safe.

**3. Visit the Erawan Shrine**

Erawan shrine also called ‘Thao Maha Prom Shrine’ is a statue of Phra Phrom, it’s the Thai representation of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. It shows the relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism. Thai people regard it as their guardian spirit.

It’s located at the Grand Hayatt Erawan Hotel at Ratchaprasong intersection. It’s a busy place just next to shopping malls. The smell of the incense sticks, music, and beautiful flowers makes the place feel very serene.

You can visit it any-day from 6am to 11pm, free of cost. You can just pray on your own or hire Thai dancers to accompany your prayer for an extra cost.

Although Erawan is the most visited one, There are five other shrines in the area if you wanna visit them as well. You can tour them all in one visit.

**4. Relax in a park**

Bangkok may be a bustling metropolis, but it's also home to some beautiful parks. There are many parks where you can wander around. Lumphini Park, Benjakitti Park, Queen Sirikit Park, King Rama IX Park, and Rommaninat Park are the most famous parks of all. They are a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a popular spot for locals to relax, play sports, and enjoy the scenery. So when you get there, you can meet with the locals and enjoy with them.

You can even rent a paddle boat and take a leisurely tour of many parks’ lakes. And if you're feeling competitive, join in on a game of takraw, it’s a traditional Thai sport similar to volleyball, with the local people. But be warned, they're pretty good at that.

**5. Visit Bangkok Art and Culture Center**

If you need some AC during the mid day, given how hot Thailand is, it’s the perfect place to go. Also if you love some art, you can visit here. It is located only a few minutes walk from National Stadium BTS Skytrain metro Station. just get off at the station and it’s easily accessible.

It has a modern building with shops and galleries surrounding a central atrium. It looks like a shopping mall when you enter the building. On the lower floor you’ll find private galleries, boutiques and coffee shops. Upstairs you can explore exhibitions from some of Thailand’s best and brightest artists along with art by famous foreign artists.

It is open from 10am to 9pm and closed on Mondays and yes its free. It is a good location to put on your itinerary and you can plan to spend around 2 to 3 hrs in there.",Free Things to do in Bangkok,,cheaptravelbuddy1,,0,3/7/2023 2:16

Pretty much as the title says. I'm looking for like-minded adventure travellers to start a random travel club. Over the past year, I got a liiiiiiitle bit obsessed with some tools I found to generate random destinations for travel. (Not sure if I can post links so I will leave them out for now.) I've been doing imaginary random travel draws for a while now and almost all of them yielded interesting results in some way or another.

The idea of the club would be to pick one set of random coordinates per year (I've come up with several methodologies but won't bore you with that yet!) and all members will try to get there independently at some point over the course of the year - maybe post a selfie from the official spot, share some stories of getting there, post travel pictures from that country/region for a year, really immerse ourselves in that place's travel riches for a year.

Maybe this will get zero traction but I'm hoping at least a few people out there are curious about this as one way to explore the world.

By way of example, I did a soft launch this year with just my family and a few friends. We drew San Marino, coordinates: 43.9422, 12.4637 so we made our official destination a nearby gelateria called Altro Gelato. We're going to tie it into a larger Italy trip this summer!

I weigh 120 pounds, and I know I'm not supposed to have a pack more than 20% of my body weight which would be 24 pounds. The pack weighs 6 so I could only load 18 in it.

backpacking,"Gudvagen Norway or Tofino Canada

So I got this job offer sea kayak guiding in Norway in the fjords, it looks beautiful and it’s based out of gudvagen. I also got a job offer in Tofino, BC for the summer and it looks like a place I could potentially settle longer term or be based out of. I’m having a really hard time deciding between the two, I am from Canada so I feel like B.C. is always an option for me and Norway seems really intriguing and different but I’m so on the fence as they both look like beautiful places and Canada seems like more of a comfortable transition. 

Obviously it is my choice and I have to listen to my gut but I was hoping that maybe someone would have information on both or one of these places from personal experience and give me some input !

backpacking,"Hey fellow Redditors!

I recently came back from an epic backpacking trip around Asia, and let me tell you, it was incredible! The food, the culture, the scenery - it was all amazing. But there was one thing that kept bugging me throughout my travels: internet censorship.

Whether it was trying to access my favorite streaming services or staying in touch with my friends and family back home, it seemed like every country had its own set of online restrictions. That's when I decided to try out a VPN - and it was a game-changer.

If you're a fellow traveler, or even just someone who cares about online privacy and security, here are five reasons why you need a VPN in your life:

1. Access Your Favorite Websites Anywhere: With a VPN, you can bypass internet censorship and access any website or service you want, no matter where you are. Whether you're trying to watch Netflix in a country where it's blocked or accessing a social media platform that's banned, a VPN will get you there.
2. Stay Safe on Public Wi-Fi: We've all been there - you're at a coffee shop or airport, and the only available Wi-Fi network is unsecured. With a VPN, you can encrypt your internet connection and protect yourself from hackers and other online threats.
3. Get Better Deals on Flights and Hotels: Did you know that some airlines and hotels offer different prices based on your location? By using a VPN to change your location, you can find better deals and save money on your travels.
4. Avoid Geo-Restrictions: Certain content, like TV shows and movies, are only available in certain regions. With a VPN, you can change your virtual location and access that content no matter where you are in the world.
5. Protect Your Privacy: Finally, using a VPN is a great way to protect your online privacy. By masking your online activity and location, you can avoid targeted ads and other invasive practices that compromise your privacy.

So there you have it - five great reasons to start using a VPN today. Trust me, it'll make your travels (and online life in general) so much easier and more secure. I found this [**Community Website**](https://www.vpngrades.com) on Reddit with that latest discount codes from different providers.

backpacking,"Hello community! I am struggling to find a device that would allow me to accurately track the distance I have moved and reset that distance multiple times each day. Can you help me find one? Ideally, there is a watch that does this, but I am open to other suggestions. 

WHY?: In 2011 I hiked the Via Francigena from Canterbury to Rome. Back then, the directions I had gave a distance and then the next direction. For example, ""...turn right onto a dirt road - 1.2km - veer to the right at the big tree - 200 m - turn left up the hill..."" It was like I was following an old treasure map. Back then I used a pedometer that I could reset at will. I am setting off on the Via Francigena again. I don't believe the ""trail"" is well-marked. There is an app that shows the route on Maps, but I don't want to have to look at my phone any more than is necessary. I'd like to follow the directions I had last time. 

Every watch I've looked at resets automatically at midnight but lacks the ability to reset at will. In my perfect world, I can look at my watch to see how far I have traveled. Push a button to reset that distance to zero, and then move on to the next waypoint. 

Does such a watch (or possibly other devices) exist that does that?

backpacking,"Where do you guys draw the line? How do you choose?

I'm looking at the REI Flash 55L Osprey Atmos AG 50L. 

The REI bag is full 1.5 POUNDS lighter than the Osprey bag, and a full $100 cheaper too.

The REI bag fit well and I even took it out over the weekend in the fall on one of the REI sponsored backpacking intro classes. 

However the Osprey felt so much more comfy, like it was an extension off my back. I tried it on in REI, loaded it with ~30lbs, and walked around. 

I'm stuck choosing and don't have a lot of experience. This is my first bag and I'm new to backpacking - with only one overnight weekender under my belt so far.

1. I ordered the ""High Uintas Wilderness Map"" online. Is the trail pretty easy to follow? Are there ever any signs or markers updating you on where you are at?

2. I know this year we are getting blasted with snow all over the region. How bad will it be out there? I've done Rainier and a bunch of 14ers so I'm good with snow travel but I just want to be sure because some friends of mine are coming with. Some with experience and some without. If there is snow still would we need crampons/axe or could we get by with boots or boots/microspikes?

3. If there are no fire bans, is there a lot of available wood to burn or pretty bare? I pretty much cold soak everything but its nice to be warm by a fire and heat up some spam in foil.

4. Any super important tips or info I wouldn't find by reading stuff online?

5. Anyone hike the UHT that's also done the LT? I did the LT last summer. From what I've been reading it seems like it'd be less strenuous but still a solid work out. I'm trying to get an idea for how many days I should plan on doing it in.

4. Onto Mexico for 2 weeks. Mostly Tulum and the beach area of Mexico, hostel hopping etc.
5. Into South America (Columbia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Brazil) Hostel hopping, football matches, seeing as much as we can of each place. Some hiking here too but no camping. 

Then home! We are hoping to have some flights and accommodation booked in advance (we’ll have the heavy flight from Auckland to Mexico pre booked and our flight home from Brazil pre booked).

backpacking,"Me and a friend are backpacking in Panama for 2 weeks and although we’re both experienced solo travelers, there’s not a ton of information on Panama. My family is actually from there, my mother grew up there, but it’s been decades since they’ve been home. I really want to have a cultural and home-feeling experience. 

First: Buses. I’ve heard about the Diablos Rojos, but they’re a little hard to track down. Is there website or resource that will give me options/times? We’re also taking a night bus from Panama City to Boquete. Does anyone recommend a good bus company that has seats decent enough to sleep on?

Second: Hiking. We’re going to hike a lot in the Boquete area and are wondering how protected we need to be against bugs in April and if anyone has any non-toxic tips for that. I don’t typically travel in warmer months, so I’m not sure what to expect in the Panamanian jungle. Also any suggested hikes to add to our list or avoid would be helpful! 

Third: Money. I’ve heard that they use US dollars, even for cash transactions. How true is that and are credit cards widely accepted?

Fourth: Language. My grandma has definitely prepped me for using all formal pronouns and whatnot. But, she hasn’t been back in so long, is there anything else to know about Panamanian Spanish vs. other dialects? My Spanish is rusty, but I at least want to be respectful.

Fifth: I’m normally not the type to be worried about pickpockets and whatnot, but I’ve heard jewelry and fancy electronics are less common there. How true is that? My friend and I are both photographers, so we’ll have some gear with us. How can we prevent from looking too flashy?

backpacking,"Hi everyone,

In November, I'm planning to spend just over 6 months travelling through Mexico, Central America and a few South American countries. 

I'm starting in Mexico and hoping to spend around a month there (though I can flex to stay a bit longer), and wondered if I could get some feedback for my rough itinerary. One thing to bear in mind as that as of now I can't drive so I wouldn't be able to hire a car for any of this. I don't want to be rushing around too much and understand that the distances between some of these places are pretty huge so want to check it's all doable and allowing for a bit of recovery time from travelling. Ideally, I'd like to strike a good balance between cities/history/culture, nature, and beaches. And above all, great food!

Most news articles that I can see are from January or December, so there isn’t too much recent news on the subject - I’m wondering if this means things are getting slightly calmer or if it just means mainstream media has moved on. I know that Machu Picchu has reopened but this is only because the protests have moved to Lima (as of mid-Feb).

5d/4n
The hardest cycle so far. 
Nouakchott to Atar (460km)
I left Nouakchott and cycled straight into NE headwind blowing faster than I could pedal for 2.5 days straight. To give some insight, I had wind gusts of 58KPH from NE/ENE; I cycle at 20KPH... Yes, every KM felt like double. The temperature was 35-40°C, and I experienced 2 full days of sandstorms. I later came to learn that the wind I was experiencing would carry dust across the Atlantic Ocean and turn the skies of SE USA red, the wind is known as La Calima. 
I slept in the wild for 3n, and in an Army (Gendarmerie) compound for 1n.

DAY 1: 
Nouakchott NE (90km)
The first day I had been warned about the headwind and sandstorms by a fellow cyclist, and friend - Raymond Lee over a pre-departure coffee. But, as I had no previous solid experience on to base these warnings, I left unaware of what lay ahead. I began cycling at 9 am and left the city by 10:30 am. The desert sand consumed the horizon with small, undulating dunes spotted around. At this stage, there were small settlements of 2-6 houses sprawled throughout the dunes. 
After 4 hours of riding, I ran out of water. I had only left with 4.5L (3x1.5L bottles), and (to this day I question whether it was correct), I gave a full 1.5L bottle to a group of men beside the road. So there I was, 4 hours into my ride, heat beginning to set in, no human life for 360° around me, and out of water. 
I was saved by a passing motorist who gave me a .75L bottle and a Baguette, which was enough to get me to a random house with a Water Pillow. I had heard of these pillows, they're usually Orange and rectangular. Inside is potable water accessed by spearing a balloon-like end at the top with a pipe, and then siphoning the water out. I filled my (now) 4x bottles and continued. 
At 50km from Nouakchott, the wind began whipping sand, and became near impossible to continue cycling, so I sought refuge in a Radio Tower. I was surprised to see a lone worker asleep in a makeshift hut at the base of the tower, he awoke as I entered and immediately offered me tea and a piece of foam to sit on. We spoke broken French until the wind subsided, and I continued for a further 20km until again, I was low on water. This time, I managed to find a Water Pillow with relative ease and walked over to fill my water. As I knelt beside the pillow, I was met with an odd situation. A large African woman appeared and questioned me - ""You are Muslim?"", I politely said no. She became exasperated and aggressively started talking in French, I didn't get a good feeling, so began walking back to my bike with empty bottles. 
At this point, a beat-up Mercedes van was passing by, he must've guessed the situation and stopped. The motorist's name was Mohammed-Ji and grabbed a full 10L water tank from his van to fill my bottles, he also gave me some biscuits. 
I cycled a further 20km until the sun began setting and the blue sky gave way to purple. I spotted a group of dunes amongst the vast pancake plateau, they were about 400m off the road and offered 270° protection from the wind. 
I erected my tent behind the dunes, and beside the ominous sight of a decomposed camel carcass. 

Taken from my Journal - 
""Today was tough. No villages or shops from Nouakchott (90km), Very Hot, No Shade. The environment is deathly, People's kindness was the only respite.""
""Desert Distance is confusing. There are no landmarks or changes in scenery. 100KM is not measured by towns passed, as there are simply none. Instead, the only constant is Pedal Stroke. It is hypnotic and mind-emptying.""
""This is an alien land, not made for Humans. Nothing grows, you can't help but worry - about water, food, shade - you can't relax.""
""Desert Nights are the stage for Dreams. The temperature drops and darkness covers the barren landscape... it allows you to lucidly dream, to pretend you're somewhere else; only bound by your imagination.""

DAY 2:
90KM to 165KM (75KM)
Waking up on the cool sand, and being covered by the emerging Sun behind hugging dunes allowed me to ease into the 2nd day. However, as soon as I exited the tent and my head was exposed over the dunes, I felt the wind - stronger than yesterday. I packed my tent quickly. 
I backed into the wind to boil some oats for breakfast; at that moment of hunger, I realized that I did not have a lighter to ignite my Gas Stove. My mind was working in overdrive and I didn't even allow doubt to enter, I opened the Gas valve to Full, and sparked my flint rod. After 3 false sparks, I managed to shoot a spark into the jet and ignite the flame. I boiled water for 2min until lukewarm to conserve my Gas, this made for an average breakfast. 
Today was noticeably more difficult. The wind was stronger, the sand was blinding (my sunglasses fell off my hat whilst cycling out of Auberge Samira in Nouakchott), my nutrition was minimal, and I was feeling lonely. 
I managed to find a home within my mind whilst moving. I didn't think, I didn't move my eyes - I just cycled hypnotic for 6 hours. I stopped when I found the first shade I had seen since morning, it was a shrub, and it was a bed. I slept under that Bush for 1hr before cycling a further 30 mins. It was then that I found a small Service Station, the first resupply point in 2 days. I bought 4x1L bottles of water (9.25L total NOW), Chocolate, and Sardines. I sat at the lonely station; a lonely man. Whilst there, I looked to the sky and was surprised to see a passing Contrail from an aircraft above, I remember thinking - ""I would do anything to be in that plane"".
After a slump of feeling weak, the sugar filled my veins with enough energy to push on a further 20km to a hamlet called Al-Asam. Whilst passing through, I was invited for tea by a local man and was gifted with biscuits for the road. I asked where the next town was and he said ""80KM - Akjoujt"". 
By this stage, it was 4 pm (it gets dark at 7 pm) - I made peace with cycling through the night. I decided to push a further 80km to Akjoujt. By 6 pm, I had managed 18km and my body was weary. I heard a voice from behind a shrub and noticed a lone man sitting on a rug beside his car. He called me over for tea, I learned his name was Sidi-Mohammed, a mining engineer of some sort that worked in Akjoujt. Whilst sitting with him, he revealed a large silver bowl - inside was a Mighty portion of Rice, Beans, and Goat Leg. It was a gift from above. 
We ate and chatted (he spoke English) for 45 mins before he explained that he needed to get to Akjoujt. When I think back, that man had a Toyota Hilux with an empty tray, I could've put my bike in it, and I'm sure he would've agreed... for some reason, I didn't ask. Before he left, he offered me 200 OUG (AUD 8). I declined and yelled ""your friendship costs more than that"" - he drove away smiling, and I cycled away lonely, fatigued, and concerned about finding a camp spot. 
I spotted the largest shrub on the horizon and cycled across the soft sand toward it. It provided me 180° protection from the wind, I erected my tent in the dark and began sparking my flint into the Gas Stove. Immediately I got a flame, I began boiling Raw Lentils for not long enough. I mixed them with a tin of Sardines and ate crunchy, difficult-to-digest beans with warm canned fish, at least I was eating. I slept deeply. 
Taken from my Journal - 
""Today, the horizon is impaired by shifting sands, blowing faster than I can cycle. This is the most miserable I have ever felt. Why am I doing this? I want Coastlines &amp; Waves, instead, I chose cycling head-first into a Desert.""
""Sand and Dust everywhere. I haven't showered in 3 days, and each time I stop for a rest, a swarm of flies attacks. Every little thing is irritating me. I want to get out of Mauritania.""
""I could've asked Sidi-Mohammed for a lift. But this is my Guilty Pleasure, I enjoy this struggle.""

DAY 3:
165KM to Akjoujt
Woke up at 3 am - wet. I had lost Bladder Control through the night due to fatigue, and the amount of water I'd been consuming (roughly 12L). I sat up to wash myself off and felt wet on my face, I wiped away the moisture to find blood dripping from my nose and dried under my eyelids, forehead, and cheek. This was the point I realized that the human mind is stronger than our body. My mind would've pushed my body to Total Shutdown if it wasn't for this reminder. 
I sat awake from 3 am until the sun rose, breathing deeply, drinking water, and stretching. In that moment of chaos, I noticed everything was peaceful and heavenly. 
There was no moon visible, therefore the stars had a chance to shimmer and show their subtle beauty without the spotlight from the moon.
The stars slowly bid farewell and the sun rose, I packed my tent away in habitual fashion and got to preparing Breakfast. I knew today was a Big push to Akjoujt, I was aware that my body might not be up for it either, so I got the final Coffee I had left - I needed all the help I could get. One thing about cooking with 1 pot, is the mixture of ingredients... I can't boil my oats AND boil a coffee... so, coffee-infused Oats it was. It did not taste good, but at this stage, I was eating for Nutrition, not for taste. 
The cycle today was the toughest day out of 5d. I managed 90km into the most Direct Headwind so far, it took me a complete Sun-cycle, I began at Sunrise and arrived at Sunset. 
Along the way, I ran close to emptying my water 2xtimes. The final time happened 20km outside of Akjoujt when I had a choice to make - Risk being stranded overnight with no water, or remain here (it was getting dark) and seek help, I chose to continue and was blessed with a left-hand turn taking me away from my Northeast heading and toward a Northerly heading. This directional change brought me away from Headwind for the final 20km and allowed me to make the final 20km in 1 hour. 
As I neared Akjoujt, flat desert plains gave rise to mountains and canyons. The sun seeped below the horizon and the sky lit up in deep pink and purple - Apocalyptic. 
I passed a Military Checkpoint at the entrance of the town border and handed over my Passport and Fiche (itinerary). After 2mins I was waved into the town which for 3d had represented an Oasis for me, an opportunity to find a bed, charge my electronics, and resupply food... this was not the case. 
I rode into the center of town in the dark to the tune of the Call to Prayer. The village looked reminiscent of a Pakistani/Afghan village - dilapidated mud-brick homes, donkey carts tied to fences, and men in groups on street corners. I knew I was 1 conversation away from Friend or Foe - I just got that feeling. 
I cycled to a sign that looked like ""Hotel"" and noticed 2 young Pakistani men out the front. I asked whether a room was available, to which they said no. However, they knew someone in town who might have a room and called him. I waited 20mins with the 2 men for their friend to arrive on a Bicycle. By the time he arrived, fatigue had settled into my veins and I was tired, also, a group of 20 street kids and men had circled what likely was the only white man in the village. 
The hotel owner and I exchanged what we thought were fair prices on the street, and in front of the crowd. When we did not reach an agreement, the crowd became vocal and adamant that I was being disrespectful (I countered his €40 for 1n, with €10). I was frustrated, fatigued, and no longer scared of the outcome. 
I smiled at the Hotel Owner and extended my hand to shake his, as his hand fell into mine, I pushed my thumb into the soft flesh of his upper palm with all the force I could. I didn't release my grip, and said very clearly ""I will leave now"". Afterward, I slowly released my grip and began cycling out of town, I got 100m until I realized this guy was following me. I planned to cycle to a group of elderly men and play the victim to get help - I struck Gold. 
After a 500m passive chase (cue the ""Benny Hill Theme Song""), I noticed a 3m high barb-wired fence compound that belonged to the Gendarmerie. Out the front were 5 soldiers, I cycled to them and asked for a place to pitch my tent in their compound as I felt unsafe being followed by this Hotel Owner. They looked at me (took pity on me), and shooed off the pesty follower. One soldier, in particular, Moctar, took to me. He explained that he was the Captain and that I could camp behind his home which he shared with 2 other soldiers. 
We walked over to his place, I pitched my tent, and then Moctar asked if I wanted a shower - my first shower in 4 days. Admittedly, it was a tiled floor with a hole drilled for a drain, and water contained in a Jam bucket... but it felt like a cleanse. I washed an inch of sand from my skin, it was so thick that my tattoos were covered. 
After a shower, I came out to the sitting room where yellow cracked bricks walled the house, soldiers lay sprawled on dirty mats, and a TV thicker than it was wide commanded the attention of all in the room. That night, 3 Gendarmerie soldiers and I drank tea, watched a FIFA WC 2018 replay of Portugal vs. Russia, and then plotted ways to obtain Australian visas for Mauritanian soldiers... I doubt a sponsorship letter from me will help, but the sentiment was appreciated. 
I slept that night safely and cleanly. 

DAY 4:
Akjoujt to 360km
I woke up after an interrupted sleep, I shared the gardens of the military compound with nocturnal Goats that found amusement with headbutting steel fences. Not only was my sleep interrupted by my environment, but I also woke up with a blocked nose - I blew outside of the tent and saw another thick ball of blood. 
Moctar had explained the previous night that the Compound gates opened at 7 am. So, I sat awake from 5-7 am chatting inside with the soldiers, exchanging FB, Gmails, WhatsApp, and, something I experienced Deja Vu from - watching the circling of Mecca on Islamic TV. That is something I so vividly remember from my time spent with Ed in Pangandaran, Indonesia when I was days away from an Indonesian wife, a Seafood Warung, and life in a beautiful Indonesian village. ""I wonder how Ed is?""
I grabbed a head-sized Brioche bun, a leg-sized Baguette, and 4 bananas from a shop opposite the military compound and began the cycle out of Akjoujt. 
I managed 20km over the most poorly-maintained stretch of road so far. I eventually opted for the compacted sand on the shoulder as the ankle-deep potholes were taking too much concentration to avoid. 
After 20km, I rounded a large mountain and was transported from the desert to arid Kyrgyzstan. Sand became soil, dunes became slopes, and stick huts became rug-walled Yurts.
Along the ride, I had an itching to climb one of these mountains. After an hour of searching for the ""right"" one, I decided on a 200m high Hill made up of craggy rock with a defined spine to traverse. I left my bike along the side of the road and began hiking up the hill, the feeling was unique. I was high enough to appreciate how far I had come, but in front of me revealed how far I still had to ride. The road ahead was long and straight, it stretched as far as the eye could see. Apart from the route forward, I was presented with dried riverbeds clearly defined by the shrubs growing amongst the moist soil, groups of Camels roaming the plains searching for food, and dotted camps of 3-4 tents at the base of large hills. 
That moment atop the mountain was my most joyful so far, I was away from the bike, away from the road, away from the suffering - and alone above the landscape. 
After descending the mountain, I continued cycling until I was out of the mountainous valley and uncommon grassland, and back into the wind and heat of the Sandy Sahara. The following 50km was marked by unchanging sand and 2x Radio Towers. It was hell. 
The roads were so long, and so straight that it was possible to view as far as the eye could see into the horizon, and catch it 3/4 times in a day. It killed me emotionally and psychologically. 
Along this 50km stretch, I ran out of water. This situation was different from the others - there were NO settlements nearby and I hadn't seen a car for &gt;2hr. I was alone. My lips became so dry that 1 large scab formed that sealed my lips together. 
I decided to stop riding and wait. I created shade by leaning my bike against my back and draping a towel across the handlebars and over my head. Whilst waiting, I fell asleep and missed a passing car, I knew this because I saw the taillights in the distance. I was adamant about not letting this happen again and positioned myself on the road. Eventually, after 30mins a car full of Spanish-speaking Africans appeared and reluctantly gave me a bottle of water. 
I was grateful and hugged a man that looked as if he wanted to punch me. 
I continued a further 10km until again, I had run out of water. This time, a beat-up Mercedes sedan filled with a lively bunch of Arabic men swerved to stop for me, they handed me water, Chocolate, biscuits, and a photo. They left speeding, and so did I... That exchange sparked life into my veins. The ""Reckless Youth"" helps those in need. 
Third time in a row, I had only cycled a further 5km when another car stopped for me (when it rains, it pours?). A pair of wealthy Arabic men asked where I was from - ""Australia!"", they replied ""Ah, you're a long way from home - please take this"", they handed me 2x1L Water bottles and a Baguette. 
That stretch of desert was harsh, but gems were gifted to me.
As I was nearing the end of the day, I was passed by a German motorcyclist called Steffen. He was a young man of 30, riding from Germany to South Africa. He had recently come from Morocco to Nouakchott and then began riding NE toward Chinguetti. Steffen asked my plan, I told him I would catch the train from Choum to Nouadhibou and then cycle north through Morocco. His words were life-giving: ""so you are leaving Mauritania? Well, let me tell you - The Hardest Part Is Over"". 
After a great chat with foreigners in foreign lands, Steffen continued his big day of 700 km, and I continued my bigger day of 95 km. 
The final hours of today were the scariest. After 10hr of riding for the 4th day straight, as night descended...

NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE: 
I was playing mind games with myself trying to close my eyes for a few seconds and pretending to micro-sleep. The next thing I remember is waking up on the downward slope of the road in the sand. It was now dark so I must've been down there for about an hour. I thought I had died, I looked over my body and was covered in sand and twigs, my toes had been grazed between the pedals and the road (I wore TEVA sandals, so no cover) and my big toenail had ripped out so the closest part to my foot was higher than the outside. I had cuts and grazes on the right-hand side of my body. But, I felt no pain, so... In my state, I thought I had died and was in a lucid afterlife where I now had powers and could travel anywhere, like when you dream that you can fly? Do you know when you think if you run fast, you will take off? Anyway, I stood up and began walking away from the road alone into the desert, my mind was so empty but I was motivated. I must have got about 400m away from my bike and the road before I started feeling pain in my feet, the sight of sand covering layers of blood on my feet snapped me back into reality. 
I walked back to my bike, I remember sleeping beside my bike, about 2m lower than the road in a sandy ditch curled in a ball. In that moment, I felt this feeling of immense disappointment, like the easy option of waking up dead and free, was ripped from me. I was without water, aching in pain from bruising and stinging from dirty grazes, and throbbing pain from my toenails having to be removed by my leatherman - I remember having to leverage the back of my toenail forward and peeling it off. 
At that moment, living was harder than dying. 
I have never gotten over that moment in time, it's not a neurotic playback of suicidal thoughts, it feels like an extra half being added to an exhausting game. I believed that I woke up a ghost and was satisfied, then, almost like a mistake from the afterlife, they kicked me out and told me to keep going on earth. 

DAY 4 (continued) - 
Laying bloodied and confused, I realized that when you strip away everything and are left with nothing, you appreciate the little things so much more. My mind was a collage of laughing with family, things I'd say to old loves, and mostly alternate realities if I made different choices in the past.

Taken from my Journal -
""I HATE this cycle, I miss my family.""
""I feel de-motivated, exhausted, homesick, lonely, angry, disconnected, paralyzed, emotionally drained. If someone offered me an easy out; I'd take it.""
""I wonder how Ed is? I would give anything to be in the beautiful jungle of Indonesia right now.""
""Life is the difference between waking up or not, it's that simple"".

DAY 5:
360km to Atar
Last night the constellations were clearer and more real than my own hands. The flat sand was bleached by the moonlight into a Lunar landscape.
I woke up wet, again. My bladder had given up and I had pissed myself, and just as the previous 2n, I had a bloodied nose again. I also had a chance to properly look at my foot and realized how deep some of the Chain Cassette teeth had dug into my Achilles and forefoot.
Despite this, I woke up strong and overcome by a sense of imminent triumph. I knew all I had to do was cycle 85km to Atar, and then I could call my Mum, Brother, and Dad - the only things that kept me going. 
I had 5% left on my phone and treated myself to listening to music. I listened to my favorite Swedish song 4 times, and Kyle's song that makes me laugh is ""Spot the Difference"". I boiled my water till bubbling this morning and drank scorching water to spike some adrenaline, I even washed my pot after to re-use it for a separate pot of oats - there was an air of calm, enjoyment, and remembrance to Savour this final morning. 
The first 45km today was quick and easy. It reminded me of Thai cycling, I had no wind, smooth roads, and averaged 24KPH. I eventually found a roadside stall and quenched my thirst for a liquid other than water - I bought a melon drink, mango juice, and orange juice. I didn't even finish them, instead, a mouthful was enough. 
At 40km from Atar, I approached an Oasis town built around beautiful Palm trees, called Ain Ehel Taya. Cycling through the town I smiled at the playful children, curious men, and shy girls. I stopped at a market stall to buy 1kg of Tangerines, they had no seeds and could be eaten whole once peeled - they were as sweet as candy and devoured in minutes. 
Leaving this town, I had my first of a series of hill climbs toward Atar. This was a bad time to realize I had no Low Gear available. Instead, I had to climb in my lowest gear (4th) instead of 1. *I later learned that my gear cables had been stretched over time, and at that stage redundant. 
At 30km from Atar, I was rewarded with a 6km long switchback carved into red mountains. Despite the heat, days of exhaustion, sore feet, and high Gear setting - I raced up the mountains standing on the pedals and with a sprint finish a Racing Cyclist would be proud of. 
The final 20km was a long, drawn-out downhill that tracked North and was flanked on my East by high mountains, therefore I was completely covered by the wind. The downhill allowed me to roll the final stretch - it was over. 
One final military checkpoint and the next question - ""Where to mister?"" 
At each checkpoint, I had said ""Atar"", so when I arrived, they were expecting me. Now, I had to think of a new place... East to Chinguetti? Northeast to Ouadane? 
No, Thank-you.  ""Choum, where I will catch the train to Nouadhibou, Thank you.""
I cycled into Atar, consulted a couple of apps and WhatsApp groups with tips from other travelers, and decided on a cheap auberge to stay at - Camp Imini. 
Atar isn't why I was happy to arrive. No, the opportunity to call my Mum, Dad, and Brother was. As soon as I arrived; as soon as they answered - ""I love you.""

Taken from my Journal - 
""CHERISH EVERYTHING. Make everything into an event. Invite people to share an experience - however big, or small. Share an experience to create a memory.""
""Experiences are richer, and sweeter when shared.""
""I look back on 5d of solitude &amp; struggle. Every KM was bought with pain, effort &amp; willpower. I arrived with depleted levels of all - my body was failing. The only part of me that remained full, and in fact, grew? Love. Love for my family shone brighter today than day 1.""",The time I traveled solo on my bike across Mauritania and nearly DIED,,Ok-Pie-906,,6,3/1/2023 5:12

backpacking,"**Looking to upgrade my tent to a lighter-weight option but have gotten a little stuck on deciding between the following. They all seem like they could work, so I'm looking for any first-hand experience to help me narrow it down.** 

 **Here is some additional context:**

* Needs to be able to fit 2p. I'll often be solo but occasionally will bring my partner or close friend along (we're comfortable being shoulder-to-shoulder) -- I also already have a hammock for solo trips
* I split my time between upstate NY (ADK) and the broader Northeast as well as Northern New Mexico, Southern CO, and the Four Corners region. This means rain, snow, humidity, dry weather, and high winds are all in the forecast. 
* Average trip duration is 3-5 days
* I don't often go out when it's below 10-15F; but I do like to have something that I can potentially take on good-weather backcountry ski tours or on the occasional winter backpacking trip; so I guess something more 3+ season oriented
* Rain and condensation management are important, particularly in the Northeast where it is seemingly always damp and humid
* When in NM in particular there aren't always great options for staking so semi-freestanding or freestanding is ideal. This is what was most attractive about the TarpTent options. 
* Will be doing some longer trips next year (Long Trail in VT) and some segment hiking of the CDT this year
* I generally take quite good care of my gear but I don't want anything too brittle. I would like to have this tent last for at least a few years. 
* My pack is the Durston Kakwa 55L so I have plenty of space to work with; although I would like to minimize weight where possible; the only caveat is that weight savings seem to come at a pretty significant price increase. Is it worth it? 
* My REI dividend also just landed, so I'd be able to pick up the non-TarpTent options for a modest ""discount""

I'm in great shape. I'm a SAR responder and have WFR cert. I've done plenty of summer mountain hiking (including near Estes Park). I've backpacked in snow. But I've never hiked through snow covered mountains. I'll be in Denver in March.

Since I've never been winter packing in the Rockies I figured I'd get a heated cabin for a Basecamp for my first time.

Anyway I'd like to get some recommendations for good day hikes within an hour-ish of where we're staying. If you guys know of any good spots that would be manageable in the winter I'd really appreciate it. 

Day 1 I'll be acclimating. Day 2 I want to do a moderate hike. Day 3 maybe a big hike with lunch on the trail above treeline if I'm adjusted to the altitude ok and the weather and avalanche conditions permit it. If not it would be good to have some lower altitude options.

Lakes, rivers, waterfalls would be great.

I have experience hiking but obviously this is a huge feat and I have been known to get a bit lonely on solo travels.

backpacking,"Hi! Experienced backpacker here! I travelled the world solo for 7 years and here are my tips:

•	⁠world adapter. Get yourself a good compact one where you can plug in usbs AND any plugs. You never know when you might need to.
•	⁠good power bank. There will be times where you might be with no access to electricity I.e. overnight bus rides.
•	⁠unlocked phone. For me it was really handy to be able to just buy a sim in any country and have access to internet for whatever. It does come in handy when you need to translate text (google translate has a cámara option where it can translate text on the spot) or look for hostels or search for transport
•	⁠travel towel. Light, easy to dry, will prevent your backpack from smelling like a wet dog. Get a big one so it can also double up as a blanket if push comes to shove
•	⁠flip flops. You DO NOT want to shower barefoot in some of the hostels
•	⁠maps.me app. You can download a whole country/area and it can be used without internet though the gps will still work. I used to pin point my hostels and off I went!
•	⁠there are many credit cards that will give you 0% interest and give you a very good exchange rate. I don’t know where you are but research with your banks. Otherwise, a good rule of thumb is being able to have your main money separate from your everyday card in case it is stolen or whatnot.
•	⁠good, comfy walking shoes. You will be walking a lot! Probably averaging out 20-30k steps a day! I recommend sketchers. They’re the hug you never knew your feet needed.
•	⁠a medical bag. Nothing too extreme but some antihistamines (really helps with mosquito bites), antiseptic&amp;anaesthetic cream will come to your rescue to prevent infections on any minor cuts and grazes when you can’t wash your wound right away &amp; tummy upset medicine.
•	⁠jacket/waterproof jacket. Even if you’ll be going somewhere hot, it’s always good to have something warm for those unexpected cool moments. I.e. somewhere that’s powering aircon like crazy
•	⁠daypack. Something you can use to carry your stuff during the day
•	⁠small valuables bag. For your id’s and cards and whatnot. Good for travelling and in case you want to keep all your valuables with you when you have to separate from your main bag.
- Cash. This is emergency money that you should keep separate from the rest of your money. You never know when you might need to use it as a bribe, in case you’re robbed or you just simply don’t have access to any ATMs to get any more cash out but can’t get to one without money. One time, it was the last bit of money I had left to help me get to the airport. 

Other things that you might consider getting once you arrive at your travel country:

•	⁠plastic bags. Helps you keep your dirty clothes from stinking out your bag/clean clothes
•	⁠wet wipes. Handiest thing for anything from wiping your face on a hot sweaty day in the city to cleaning messes! (Careful with you bathroom products!)
•	⁠alcohol gel. Use it to sanitise anything from toilet seats to your hands.

You’re going to want to buy a lot of things when you’re out there so don’t overthink about what to take. You’ll probably find a cheaper more exotic version over there. When your bag gets too heavy, send a box home through post. Souvenirs, things you won’t wear anymore at this point in time, etc. plus it’s nice box of memories once you receive it at the other end :)

REMEMBER:

•	⁠EVERYTHING is replaceable; even your passport (if it happens get in touch with your embassy)
•	⁠other backpackers will be in the same boat so we all understand each other, creating a nice community that looks out for each other
•	⁠be street smart. Don’t walk around alone with valuables in a sketchy part of anywhere.
•	⁠don’t buy drugs of side sellers. Go somewhere where everyone is doing it and refrain from taking them on big nights where police will be out to make their quotas
•	⁠(not strictly necessary but I know I could have benefitted from it) get a fake id. Some places will be wanting your id as deposit for renting something and refuse to give it back until you pay them an obscene amount of money. (Doesn’t happen often but you never know)

From Windhoek I have two different options  in terms of route of travel and would love some advice or insights from the community.  

Route 1: Windhoek - Lomé 
Stops along route - Windhoek, Oshakati, (cross border to Angola) Lubango, Luanda, (cross to DRC) Kinshasa, ride the Ubangi river  up to Zongo (cross to C.A.R) Bangui, flight from Bangui to Cotonou Benin, then finally Lomé then flight home.

Currently I have a Pull &amp; Bear backpack, they had a few in stock a few years ago, it's a little bit uncomfortable because the back and shoulders are thin and unsuitable when I travel with more stuff, so I'm looking for something more comfortable, durable and with some costumer support if I need anything.

I know brands like Patagonia, Osprey and The North Face, but I don't know any information about this kind of product, specifically. I work on an airport, and since I see this brands daily I believe they could be good, but I would like your help.

So, as I said before I'm looking for a backpack that I could use also as a carry for 5-7days, it needs to be comfortable and durable, since I enjoy to travel to different places and could be something more urban like a city, or on the other hand more harsh Environments, I saw a few from 40-45L, but I'm not sure. 

Since I'm living in Europe a backpack would be enough however I'm planning to buy a Rolling Thunder 22"" from The North Face or a Eastpak as a carry on trolley for longer travels.

backpacking,"Hey all! I'm a relatively experienced backpacker, and I'm trying to find a new place to head out into the back country, but searching all I can, I haven't found much.

In my group of three, we all like to live off the land as much as possible when we're in the back country. Foraging, fishing, and hunting small game, as well as cooking and preparing all our food. Generally speaking, we haven't had any real issues with this idea. We purchase all licenses, do our research, and only take what the land can replenish. We're all experienced, and have no problems hiking out a few miles to get to a good spot, with all our gear. We just want to be isolated from the world. There's no problem seeing other hikers on occasion, but we don't want to hear other campers or be in their sightline, you know?

I'm planning a trip to take in a couple weeks- I know, not much time. I had planned on going to the McCurtain County Wilderness Area, but I finally got in contact with the game warden, and a controlled burn is going on in my timeslot. My main backup right now is the Ozarks, a few miles into Hurricane Creek, but I've gone there several times and the fishing has been pretty poor for my group, in mid-March. Between that and the distance, I'd like something a little closer.

I love all kinds of terrain, so long as it has some elevation change, personally, as long as it can sustain us. We plan on going out 4 days and 3 nights. The only real limitation on distance, is that we have to drive there, hike out, set up camp, all in one day. As much as I would love to go out a 10 hour drive away, I can't leave much earlier than 4 AM..

I know this is a lot for a random reddit post, but maybe someone on here has some ideas? Thanks for any help, y'all.

backpacking,"For those that use carry-on sized backpacks (or convertible duffels) in lieu of traditional roller carry-on luggage, I'm curious what people do when it comes to day packs.

Since you're already wearing your carry-on as a backpack, do you stow your day pack inside the backpack? Or do most people who use these carry-on backpacks forgo day packs entirely (e.g. use the carry-on backpack as the day pack as well)? I suppose my question is more about the intended usage style for these bags.

I like the idea of being able to backpack my carry-on but haven't been able to make the switch yet because I'm at a slight loss about what to do with my day pack. Ideally, I'd want to avoid shouldering my carry-on backpack while adventuring at the destination since it is quite heavy and relatively large. But in order to bring along a day pack, I'll have to pack it inside the carry-on backpack itself and that takes up space.

In my current setup, I travel with a day pack ([Deuter Speed Lite 20](https://www.amazon.com/Deuter-Unisex-Adults-Hiking-Backpack/dp/B08JQYTZNG)) + a roller carry-on. I use the day pack for all my adventuring at the destination. The roller carry-on stays at the lodging.

backpacking,"Hi everybody! I am doing my first trip to Europe and am leaving March 5th. I'll be going by myself and staying in hostels, with somewhat of an itinerary already planned out, with some hostels and flights already booked. However, I am still indecisive about the amount of time spent and cities I go to.

So far, this is what I have planned out and booked:

**Barcelona (March 6 - 12)**  
**Lisbon (March 12 - 16)**  
**London (March 16 - 20)**

From there, the itinerary I had planned out was this:

**Edinburgh  (March 20 - 23)**  
**Amsterdam (March 23 - 26)**  
**Bruges or Ghent (March 26 - 29)**  
**Paris (March 29 - April 3)**  
**Rome (April 3 - April 8)**  
**Florence (April 8 - April 13)**  
**Venice (April 13 - April 14)**  
**Cinque Terre (April 14 - April 16)**

In the end, I do have to be back in Barcelona by April 19th for my flight back, so there are 2 - 3 days that I have to either add a city nearby, or stay extra time in another city I am already visiting. I was also considering switching Edinburgh for Prague, but the fact that it is kind of out of the way makes me rethink it. The reason I am considering it though is because many friends have recommended it. Any recommendations regarding that, or possible changes to my planned itinerary are appreciated. Also, I will be staying in hostels and planning to meet people, which makes me want to stay a little longer in each city.

I'm not too worried about the snow or the cold. But avalanche risks and getting lost are more concerning. I backpacked already several times, but in the summer, with no snow. My friend has no prior experience in camping. So that may perhaps be too tricky/dangerous for us.

I have ultimately come to the conclusion that homelessness is going to be my path forward, due to the lack of affordable housing and jobs that provide for the disabled (living with my family is *not* an option). I also cannot drive, much to my detriment. And office jobs? No thanks.

I have wanted to go backpacking continuously around the world for close to half a decade now, and the idea has always seem enticing. I can see everything I’ve ever wanted, make new friends, and get away from all the toxicity I am surrounded with on a constant basis? Sign me up! Except….how do I pay for it? That’s the catch.

Hostels aren’t always cheap, and I’ve planned to do a general rotation between them and camping or, rarely, couchsurfing. But for the everyday basics? Well, most workaway, worldpackers and other sites like those are primarily for those who can assist in back-breaking labour, so I can’t do that. Hostel work might be a good idea, but scoring it at every single location? Unlikely. Digital nomading? I have no skills for an office job in a sedentary lifestyle so why would I’ve some on the road?

This brings me to SSI, seeing as it is most likely the backbone of my future financial situation. Can you somehow, go around the world like a normal person would, using primarily SSI + savings, with secondary sources that earn a bit? Obviously, there might be a couple hundred I could score just by doing things, but using primarily SSI, is it possible to live on the road and go around the world (using slow travel, ofc) just on that?

This seems to be one of my only avenues left for a future lifestyle, and the one I want to do most. Is it possible?",I need advice on the feasibility of a future lifestyle akin to this.,,cocaiakes_03,,0,2/25/2023 18:36

I'm going to need a transportation from Budapest to Krakow. Then I'll need transportation from Krakow to Prague. 

Both of these routes have sleeper trains, however, the Budapest to Krakow one is $150 for a 3-bed compartment, and the Krakow to Prague train is $91 for the same.

In comparison, Flixbus has nightbuses between those destinations that are like $18 each. I realize my quality of sleep would be worse on a Flixbus, and I don't get a bed to sleep in like with the night train, but I just can't seem to justify an extra $100 just for a bed, especially when the hostels I'm staying at are like $20/night.

I guess another option with Flixbus is to just take the 6am bus option which gets me to my destinations around noon each day I travel. However, that will eat up part of my day, so I think I'd rather night bus it if I'm going the bus route at all.

backpacking,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for a backpack for traveling that counts as a personal item on most European airlines. (45x30x20cm max).

These are the features I am looking for, starting with the most important ones:

* Comfortable for all-day carry, without sweating too much.
* bright interior (no black, so I can actually see stuff)
* Maybe Water Bottle Holder

&amp;#x200B;

It should probably be able to fit:

* 1 water bottle 
* 1 packable jacket or 1 towel and swimshorts
* 1 camera (a7s2) or 1 drone (mini3pro)
* usual small items like power bank, sunglasses, sunscreen, snacks, wallet

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, space for a 16"" MacBook but not a dealbreaker if the rest fits :)

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking forward to hearing from you, I was looking at the aer day pack 2, but it's very expensive to ship to Germany. 

Also the Kanken Laptop 17"", but I have no experience with this and it looks uncomfortable? Any experiences? No padding and thin straps? Also, not much internal organization, 1 more pocket for smaller stuff would be nice.

Anyway, hope you have some advice :)",comfortable personal item backpackl,,vegane-currywurst,,0,2/24/2023 19:01

In the nearest future I'm planning to do more serious backpacking and hope to save some weight by buying an **ultralight tent**, but **I'm rather tall at 193 cm (\~6'4ft)**.

My budget is **around 300€/260£** (could be a little more for a good option, but prefer spending less). The tent should weigh **as light as possible** (&lt;1,5kg), **true 2 persons tent would be ideal (2 long wide sleeping pads)**.

(I’ve tried all the brands, btw, and it’s so hard to fit anything on my lithe, tall 67 lb standard poodle). I’m mostly a weekend warrior but I also like to spend up to 4-5 nights out whenever I can, so it has to be large enough to hold our food and smellables for that long, but also short enough to fit sideways in my pack - Gregory Kalmia 60L.

Hi all, we will update Camping tips series in different tourist attraction of the USA, let's start from tips in different National Parks:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ez5radv5r1ka1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=baf612bdfd32123bf3392ef864e5e824aa4f9448

National Parks in the USA offer some of the most beautiful camping spots in the world, and they are a perfect destination for families who want to experience the great outdoors. However, while camping can be a lot of fun, it's important to be prepared for any situation, including power outages or emergencies. Here are some camping tips for families who are traveling to different National Parks of the USA, and why emergency power and solar panel systems are important while camping.

# Grand Canyon National Park

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8g58ein6r1ka1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e6837c4e00eccd8c9c5317c36fae51360f2534f4

The Grand Canyon is one of the most popular National Parks in the USA, and it's a great destination for families who want to experience the beauty of the Southwest. However, the park's remote location and limited access to electricity can pose challenges for families who are camping. That's why it's important to have a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, to ensure that you have access to power in case of an emergency.

Specific Usage Scenario of Emergency Power in Grand Canyon National Park:

1. Charging devices: Having a portable generator or solar panel system can help keep your devices charged while camping.
2. Lighting: In case of an emergency, having a backup power source can provide lighting for your campsite.
3. Medical equipment: If someone in your family requires medical equipment that relies on electricity, having a backup power source can be life-saving.

# Yellowstone National Park

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9c9h27d7r1ka1.jpg?width=730&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d1387ed49d593b2b8198d4a1514fb710f6f0931

Yellowstone is another popular National Park that offers some of the most beautiful camping spots in the USA. However, the park's remote location and limited access to electricity can pose challenges for families who are camping. That's why it's important to have a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, to ensure that you have access to power in case of an emergency.

Specific Usage Scenario of Emergency Power in Yellowstone National Park:

1. Charging devices: Having a portable generator or solar panel system can help keep your devices charged while camping.
2. Heating and cooling: If the temperature drops at night, having an electric heater can provide warmth, and if the temperature rises during the day, having an electric fan can provide cooling.
3. Refrigeration: If you have perishable food or drinks, having a backup power source can ensure that your food stays cold and fresh.

# Yosemite National Park

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0fxjhj18r1ka1.jpg?width=1250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bfd9fc4e4cafbec15b87d3b39652af5ee09e077e

Yosemite is another National Park that offers stunning camping spots for families who are traveling. However, the park's limited access to electricity can pose challenges for families who are camping. That's why it's important to have a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, to ensure that you have access to power in case of an emergency.

Specific Usage Scenario of Emergency Power in Yosemite National Park:

1. Charging devices: Having a portable generator or solar panel system can help keep your devices charged while camping.
2. Lighting: In case of an emergency, having a backup power source can provide lighting for your campsite.
3. Cooking: If you have an electric stove or grill, having a backup power source can ensure that you can cook your meals.

Emergency power and solar panel systems are important while camping for a few reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2a4p5vbgr1ka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0410e9f72e91dfa5c5916847543fd7554ea60105

First, they can help keep you safe in case of an emergency. For example, if someone in your family requires medical attention, having a backup power source can be life-saving.

Second, they can provide comfort and convenience while camping. For example, having an electric heater or fan can help keep you comfortable during extreme temperatures.

Third,emergency power and solar panel systems can also help reduce your environmental impact while camping. Instead of relying on fossil fuels for power, a solar panel system can harness energy from the sun, which is a clean and renewable source of energy. This can help reduce your carbon footprint while still providing the power you need for your camping trip.

When choosing an emergency power source or solar panel system, it's important to consider the specific needs of your family and the camping location you will be visiting. For example, if you will be camping in a remote location with limited access to electricity, a portable generator may be the best option. However, if you will be camping in an area with ample sunlight, a solar panel system may be a more practical and eco-friendly choice. And there are some Emergency brands that are recommed: Jackery/Bluetti/Ecoflow/Bigblue/Togopower/[Yargopower](https://yargopower.com/)/goalzero etc.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to having a backup power source, there are a few other camping tips that can help make your trip more enjoyable and safe.

First, make sure to bring plenty of food, water, and supplies for your family, as well as any necessary camping gear.

Second, be prepared for the weather by bringing appropriate clothing and gear for different conditions.

Finally, make sure to follow park rules and regulations, and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect the environment and wildlife.

In conclusion, camping in National Parks of the USA can be an amazing experience for families who want to connect with nature and create lasting memories. However, it's important to be prepared for any situation, including power outages or emergencies. By having a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, you can ensure that your family has access to power and stays safe during your camping trip.",Camping Tips for Families travelling in National Parks of the USA,,Yargopower,,0,2/24/2023 2:26

backpacking,"I am looking into insurance for medical emergencies/sudden illness that could arise during a 5-month backpacking trip through several countries.

We are moving to a cold, wet climate with much longer winters soon (yeeee!). I know, HYOH. But in cold wet conditions it comes down to safety.

backpacking,"While most people dream of long-term trips, exploring every corner of the world, I think shorter, more frequent trips are the way to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be a travel addict. I spent years saving money to take long-term trips to exotic destinations. I backpacked through Southeast Asia, traveled the Trans-Siberian Railway, and explored the mountains of South America. I thought I had it all figured out.

&amp;#x200B;

But after years of travel, I realized that I was burning out. It was exhausting to constantly move from place to place, living out of a backpack and never truly feeling settled. I missed the comfort of a stable home and the routine of daily life.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided to switch things up. Instead of taking long-term trips, I started taking shorter ones, a week at a time at maximum. I would plan these trips months in advance so I had something to look forward to, but I wouldn't spend months on the road.

&amp;#x200B;

This change allowed me to slow down and truly enjoy each destination. I could immerse myself in the local culture rather than rushing through a list of tourist attractions. I could relax, take my time, and truly experience each place.

&amp;#x200B;

And the best part? I could travel with just a Voyager leather carry-on bag. This bag is the perfect size for a short trip and stylish enough to bring to both casual and formal settings. It's also incredibly durable, which is vital for someone who's always on the go.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit it was hard to give up my long-term travel dreams. But I'm so glad I did. I now have a healthy balance between traveling and having a stable home life. I can take short trips whenever I want and thoroughly enjoy each destination without feeling rushed or burned out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I believe that short, frequent trips are the way to go. And if you're going to do that, then traveling with just a Voyager leather carry-on bag is the best option. It's versatile, durable, and stylish, allowing you to pack everything you need without overpacking.

So I’m leaving my job March 31st

I plan to do northern Thailand then southern Thailand then fly to Bali and see how I feel. Go home when I’m ready

I haven’t done any planning. I don’t have any work to do on my notice period so I have time to plan.

I’m just wondering if I’ve made the right decision and if you have advice and where to start. All the information is so overwhelming when I research 😬

I’ve also decided to start taking SSRIs now in the hope that my mental health is better by the time I go so I can enjoy the experience more but I don’t know if it’s a bad idea. 

I have no idea what I’m going to do career wise- if I want to stay in the same field or train up in something else so I’m not sure whether to sort that out first 

I was mainly worried about sitting around and doing nothing so it was making me anxious. So I booked the flight, now I’m worried I was too hasty with it

I have about $12k savings but obviously don’t want to blow through that. After my travels I’m moving across the country, furnishing an apartment etc. and I have student loans lol

I have never solo traveled and am very worried about getting lonely.

Idea 1: Australia/Fiji
I was initially thinking Australia/Fiji, but the Australia component is quickly becoming expensive ($45/night for shared room hostels) and not a lot of WWOOF opportunities near big cities/attractions. However, I still am really interested in this plan but I just don’t know if there’s a cheaper way to swing it. I also felt comfortable with this plan because I’ve heard the locals are very nice, easy to make friends with locals, and I can speak the language so I figured it would be easier to get around within the country 

Idea 2: Thailand/Indonesia 
Another long time travel dream of mine. Expensive to get there but super cheap once you’re there. I’ve heard it’s backpacker friendly but I’m still worried about getting lonely from fleeting friendships and wanting to go on adventures but not having anyone to do it with. Also worried about the language barrier.

Any suggestions or thoughts? Open to any other locations (except South America, I’ve been all over that continent and looking for something different). I’m not sure what to do. The main things I want are: finding other backpackers to travel with, not getting lonely, not too expensive if possible, safe for young female solo travelers.

backpacking,"Hey all,

I am heading to South America in April and will be travelling with my camera and laptop (£2000 value total).

Interested to hear what people do in similar situations, do you leave valuables in your room? (I will be predominantly staying in private rooms) or do you take them everywhere with you?

We will be a few places where being mugged/having bag stolen in public is a very real concern.

Thanks in advance :)",Leaving valuables in private room?,,bdbilly91,,0,2/20/2023 11:27

backpacking,"I have a kind of hybrid trip lined up in May. I wasn't able to choose both flair unfortunately. I'm traveling in Italy that combines a few days in Florence, approximately two weeks (maybe more) hiking from Florence to Assisi, and then a bit more traveling (not hiking). I will be staying at a place each night, so I do not need a tent. 

I ordered an _Osprey Stratos 3m 6l_  pack I plan on living out of for the month I will be in Italy. I am also bringing a smaller Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuffsack for the plane since the bag is just a wee bit over carryon size.

The guide I'm using suggested:

*   Hiking shorts - 1 or 2 pairs
*   Long pants - lightweight and quick-drying for rain and suitable for restaurants.
*   Technical t-shirts - 2 short sleeve, 1 long sleeve 
*   Shirt or (with collar)

I'd like to go with as much merino wool as I can get away with given the frequency I'll be wearing things between washes. I've already got underwear and socks covered, so I'm really only interested in advice on the shirts, shorts and pants.

I've read merino wool alone is a fairly weak material, and is best combine with other material to add durability. What companies should I be looking at for shirt and short suggestions? I'd like limit what I bring to approximately what the guide I quoted above suggested, but I also don't want the bag to eat through the shirts, or me to eat through shorts. 

I found the following brands
    * https://unboundmerino.com/collections/shirts
    * https://woolandprince.com/collections/all
    * https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/mens
    * https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-tops#facet=product_type:%22Crew+Neck%22,product_type:%22Button+Down%22,product_type:%22Polo%22&amp;beginIndex=0

Some of the above brands seem more lifestyle type, so I'm unsure if their shirts or pants/shorts will last the trip. What do I need to be looking for for from both a durability perspective, but can double as street clothing while I'm in Florence and other cities?

Thanks!",Hybrid trip clothing recommendations,,JhnWyclf,,0,2/20/2023 5:19
backpacking,"A few months ago I made a post breaking down how much money I have spent traveling full-time over 8 months.

My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have been traveling for 10 months. Our first 8 months were spent in Eastern Europe and at the end of December we came to Japan.

Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! I hope to share this info to show that you can travel to unique places on a tight budget! 

In Europe, we used a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This was not possible in Japan, we did not set a $ amount that we had to be under but we did try to be frugal and the budget was in mind all the time. 

IF YOU ARE COMING TO JAPAN ON HOLIDAY I REALLY RECOMMEND SAVING MONEY AND SPENDING IT! 

This was my 3rd time in Japan and my girlfriend’s 1st. In Europe, we did not feel we missed out on much by being on a budget but in Japan, it is a different story. Don’t get me wrong, we had a lot of fun, but there was so much left undone because of the budget. It mostly boils down to food. We ate a lot of meals from convenience stores. We skipped a lot of the expensive seafood that if I was on holiday would have bought without a second thought.

We tried to always eat the local specialty. Raw chicken sashimi in Kagoshima and Fugu in Shimonoseki are good examples of that. 

You definitely can do things on a budget, we went to Fukuoka the tonkotsu(pork broth) ramen capital of Japan, and ate at some of the highest-rated ramen restaurants, which was very affordable. A lot of major sights and attractions are free. 

This is just one person's spend and we split basically everything. I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions you may feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

IN TOTAL I SPENT $2,768.28 or $58.89 per day. THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION/ FLIGHTS/ RAIL PASS

Some detail about the categories:

Accommodation $1,006.91 - Hostels were the primary accommodation. It was always a mixed dorm and never a private room. 5 nights we spent in an airbnb solely because there were no hostel beds available. 6 nights were “free” thanks to my cousin who lives in Akita and let us stay with him. I put quotes on that because while he didn’t charge us to stay with him, we did end up paying \~$130 to take the Shinkansen from Akita back to Tokyo, and bought him a few meals and stuff. 2 nights were spent in hotels because stuff went sideways (more on that later)

Activities $97.73 - Castles, Capybara and Micro Pig Cafes, Ninja Theme Park, Museums, and Onsens.

Alcohol $103.21 - I drank so much more during my time in Japan compared to Europe. I want to say it was because it was so cold out and meeting/socializing with so many other people in hostels. 

Coffee $8.34 - This is the occasional coffee from a 7-Eleven or a vending machine. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation. I did bring with me a lot of caffeine pills. I really like how I can wake up and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill and be good to go, they are also cheaper than coffee. My girlfriend doesn't take them primarily because she enjoys drinking coffee so much. The pills are $.03 each. 

Food $341.93 - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health $25.76 - Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc $14.03 - Kerosene to refill my cousins heaters. 

Mobile Phone $0 - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States, but my girlfriend does. If I didn’t have her phone to use I would have bought a sim card. 

Souvenir $4.08 - I try to buy a magnet in each country 

Transportation(local) $184.79 - This is using trains/buses to get around a city. We did not take a taxi or use a ride-share app while in Japan. 

Travel $595.96 - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Our flight was paid for with 35,000 American Airlines miles +$5.60. This also includes our 21-day Rail Pass. 

Cities Visited:

1. Tokyo
2. Kyoto
3. Uji
4. Osaka
5. Nara
6. Koka
7. Matsuyama
8. Fukuoka
9. Nagasaki
10. Kagoshima
11. Ibusuki

13. Shimonoseki
14. Hiroshima

21. Akita
22. Yazawa

Things that went right: The Japanese people are so friendly and welcoming. When the trains got canceled and we got stuck in Yonago, the people working at JR tried everything they could to help us. We walked to 7 different hotels with snow coming down and we must have walked past this one cafe so many times because the old couple who ran it came out to ask if we were ok and the husband walked with us to 4 more hotels and spoke to the people for us to get us a room. 

The couple who sat next to us at the Izakaya in Kagoshima helped us because we had no idea what we were doing. Ended up becoming friends and spent the next 4 hours sharing food and drinking together. 

The random people who would ask if we needed help navigating the train stations. The people are lovely. 

What went Wrong: The weather. This was to be expected since we flew into Japan on December 30. Our plan was to visit Matsue, and then take the overnight train from Matsue to Tokyo and continue on to Kanazawa. The massive amount of snow canceled those trains, we ended up getting ushered onto a train that went to Yonago and then that got canceled so a lot of people were forced to get hotel rooms (see above for the hero of that story). There was no guarantee we could get out of Yonago because it snowed all night but we got to the station at 5:45 am to try and get the 6 am train and we managed to escape! We did not get to go to Kanazawa because the trains all got canceled and we were afraid of getting stuck there and missing our reservation in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. 

While the Shinkansen rarely gets canceled the express trains and local trains get canceled all the time due to weather. Something to note.

Favorite Cities:

1. Hakodate - Cool history, good food, very cute.
2. Kagoshima - Amazing food, the soy sauce there was the best I have ever had. You can eat raw chicken sashimi there (torisashi), I thought it was ok but not great. Sand onsen nearby was amazing. 
3. Sapporo - Big city, the food in Hokkaido is absolutely incredible. Lots of cool day trips to take from here. 

Some useful resources: 

1. Ramen Database- Also has curry, gyoza, udon, soba, etc. you can search by all time ranking, by year, by prefecture, pretty cool tool and we used it a lot to find some amazing food! Ramendb.supleks .jp
2. JR pass calculator, you can plan out your route and it will show if it is worth getting the JR pass. 

I don’t know if this is allowed but we have made and are making more budget-oriented videos about this trip across Japan. You can find that stuff on our Reddit profile. 

I hope this helps anyone who dreams of going to Japan but doesn't have a ton of money. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want more info!

This year, including Prague, I plan on taking roughly 3 weeks to explore the Czech Republic, then one month to explore Poland, then one month in Slovakia and Hungary.

This fills my 3month, 90day schengen non-visa time.

backpacking,"Honestly, I could complain about this for days. From so many different angles. But for me right now the problem I’m most irritated at lately is the global travelers themselves.

People seem to be only interested, or at least an overwhelming majority of people, in going places they have already seen or heard about. Massively contributing to over-tourism and overcrowding, for what? Keeping up with Jonses? Never really thinking critically about where they should go or what it might impact? Does everyone actually love art history so much that we need to queue for the Mona Lisa? Or have people just heard about it. 

Call me incredibly salty, I probably am, but I’ve worked my ass off for 4 years with my wife on a high quality travel YouTube channel entirely dedicated to off path places. To digging deep and travelling past the trip advisor. Hiking along 1000 year old medieval pilgrim paths in Tuscany with more hidden gems than you can imagine, places that desperately could do with some tourism dollars, a mere 20 minute train ride from tourist clogged Florence. I go out into the woods to show a truly authentic German beer festival where the old traditions are alive and well instead of just covering Oktoberfest. I go to the sorts of difficult Alpine Christmas markets that many locals haven’t even heard about instead of just showcasing Munich and Nuremberg. I was the only person that week to visit several Ancient Greek cities in Turkey that are mind blowing. I have these places entirely to myself, places that would love and benefit from some tourism. If only we stopped concentrating it one or two places and instead spread it around. 

Do you know what kind of viewership the truly off path stuff gets? Zilch. Nothing. A crumb. I’m faxt it negatively impacts the growth of my channel for months. 

But yet if I do a video about a place people are already familiar with? Oh boy, tons of views.

The market pressure is on the influencer to be a sell out. 

It does my head in. If you want to travel deeper and not just be another tourist then you have to put in some work and at least expose yourself to new things, but from what I can tell by the travel audience at large….this is not what they do. I’ll hold your hand and take you to the hidden gems you say you want, all you have to do is click. 

I used to blame the influencers. Then I tried to become one to break the chain and do my part. Now I see how the people who got big, got big and it’s our fault.

It breaks my heart. Truly.

— if you want to see the proof for yourself you can find me on YouTube at NearFromHome. You’ll see the viewership for itself. Or, if my content is crap then you are welcome to give me a well deserved reality check.

Sorry for the rant though guys. Just feeling pretty frustrated at the moment.",The problems with over-tourism aren’t the travel influencers but the basic travelers who say they want to see hidden gems but won’t put in the effort to try and find new places to go | A Salty Rant.,,strawbennyjam,,0,2/18/2023 16:26

backpacking," 

Hello everyone!

I am currently looking at buying a big ass backpack, around 100 litres or more, I'm going on a long trip + with camera gear (so need lots of space). The most important thing for more other than size is how it is to carry, but also that it has a large front opening so I can easily grab my camera gear...

Now I have tried both the Fjellraven Kajka 100 l and Gregory Baltoro Pro 100 l, I think the Gregory fits a bit better, but that might just be because the Kajka wasn't fitted to my size (They only have one size that you need to fit to your size, whereas the Gregory has three sizes so they already kinda fit). I'm going some pretty rough places, and the Kajka seems better suited for that, but when I'm carrying 25 kg (maybe more or less), I want it to be as comfortable as possible.

Well, what do you guys/girls think? Any other backpack recommendations? keep in mind I live in Europe so not all American backpacks are available.

backpacking,"I spent the last couple of months saving up money. I hated my job so I decided quit and travel around Europe. I'm a young French-American male who hopes to travel and enjoy the European life. I enjoy history (especially ancient history), food, drinks, any type of music (from Jazz and classical to rap), hiking, and slow travel. I lived in the US all my life but I have plenty of family still in France. I am a French citizenship (speak it fluently) and have a decent level of Spanish.

This is going to be my first solo trip so a little nervous about that. But, thankfully I have had plenty of opportunities to travel in my youth with my family. During this trip I don't really want to have everything planned out. My only plan as of right now is to start in Barcelona for around 5 days maybe more maybe less depending on how I like it. Then travel all around the Iberian Peninsula. Then take a ferry to Morocco spend maybe a week then continue traveling western Europe. When the 2 month Eurail pass expires then head to Central Europe, then Eastern Europe then maybe end in Balkans. I think I will begin this journey in Early March.

After doing a lot of research there are a couple of questions.

1. Sim cards: For sim cards I was looking at Holafly. I was wondering how were your experiences with it or is there a better option?
2. Credit Card: I was looking at my current bank and the exchange rates were very high. I was thinking about using Revolt. Are there any better options?
3. Inter/Eurail: Would Interrail pass be worth it? I was thinking about getting the 2 month with 10 days pass. Use the pass for western Europe where the trains are better then head to Balkans and Eastern and Central Europe for the latter two months using the occasional train but mainly busses and ferries.
4. Public Transport: Being from California where public transportation is horrific, I have little to no experience with it. I was wondering what were the best apps/websites to find the right routes/transportation? And any other tips.
5. Travel insurance: This is probably more personal preference but do I need it and if so what company should I consider?
6. Passport: When I travel should I bring French or US passport or both? I know some places like Italy give huge discounts to EU citizens so French passport might be best for that.
7. Festivals: Any music festival recommendations? I was looking at ABROADFEST 2023 in Barcelona although a little expensive.
8. Recommendations: On my trip I am most excited for Istanbul (not sure now with the earthquake), Turkish Baths, Bulgarian baths, Granada, Lake Bled, and Hikes in Slovenia and Croatia. Any recommendations for cities, countries, museums, food, and hostels?
9. Reading: I really want to read a book of the country I am traveling in. Wether the author was from that Area or it happened in the area. Same things goes for movies, tv shows, and music. 
10. Any other tips or critics about the trip?

I think most of my concerns is pre-travel stress and worried about the trip. It will defiantly be a learning experience and be a major point of growth. I hope I covered everything.

Looking for either a loop or out-and-back that's about 8-12 miles total length and ~30 mins or so from Furnace Creek. Also, bonus points if the sunset/sunrise has amazing views for photography / Milky Way (not that anywhere in the park wouldn't qualify).

I was thinking of just looking at some of the popular ""day hike"" / ""touristy"" spots and making it an overnight -- like Zabriskie's Point, Mesquite flat sand dunes, Fall Canyon? Any suggestions??",Death Valley NP Overnight in Backcountry? Where to go!?,,K3wlDewd123,,0,2/17/2023 19:48

We're doing a small section of the AT this spring, and they want to visit a National Park somewhere in the western US this summer. They first suggested Yellowstone, but everything I'm reading about Yellowstone seems to be saying that we would have to rent cars just to get us to trailheads, and I don't love that idea. I would prefer to be able to use public transit for paperwork/insurance reasons (we can't just hitchhike or use unregistered shuttles). 

So, which National Parks do you think we could visit that would fit this bill?

1. Close to a major airport
2. Public transit to trailheads
3. Medium to moderately difficult section hike options (around 5 days)
4. Not-impossible-to-get backcountry camping permits (for 8-10 people)

Most of my scouts have not traveled much outside of our troop outings, so ideally, I'd also like it to be a trail that goes past at least one notable landmark so that they can say, ""I got to see \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ when I was a Girl Scout!""

In November 2021, I booked a one-way ticket.

Why?

There are multiple reasons why I moved.

The main one being, I didn't want to live in the West anymore. I wanted to move to a more conservative environment closer to my beliefs and values. Far from big cities and pollution, somewhere remote, calm and closer to nature.

I also wanted to leave the comfort I was in, I didn't want to regret not doing the move when I'm in old age. I can't imagine living in regret in my death bed and thinking to myself: ""Why didn't I do it?""

backpacking,"So I’m going to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for 3 months, and then going to Ecuador for 3 months. I was initially going to buy a Deuter 70L bag because I feel like I won’t pack toooo lightly and I’d like to bring back some gifts. It’s a proper hiking backpack that would be cool to have for future multiple day hikes. However, I’m mostly staying in 1 or 2 places while I’m in South America and not moving around too much aside from a few day hikes. Not sure if I want to lug around a huge backpack everywhere I go. I’m thinking of buying a Thule backpack that turns into a tog bag for all my stuff that I can put into cargo when flying (I really want my full range of toiletries while I’m traveling 😂) and getting a small Deuter backpack that I can use for carry on (books, journal, headphones etc.) and also for 1 or 2 day hikes. Just not sure if a 30L is a waste of money as I might need a bigger one for overnight treks in the future. 

So essentially, I want to put a bag into cargo that has a lot of space for all my clothes, my toiletries and gifts on the way back. I also need a good quality bag for carry on so that I can keep my books and art supplies on me during flights and layovers that can also double as a day bag. Thoughts? Should I commit to the 70L Deuter backpack and get a tiny tote bag or something for journals and stuff that I’d take with me everywhere I go (not sure what luggage storage will be like in Latin America so I might have to take all my possessions with me everywhere when I go on hikes/day trips) or should I split the load more and get more of a tog bag vibe and a small, decent hiking backpack that I can use for day trips?","Looking at backpacks now for South America, I need some guidance please ❤️",,seblangod,,0,2/17/2023 10:39

backpacking,"Hi!   
This is a really long meandering post but I don't know anyone who's done this so any help would be much appreciated.

I'm 27F and thinking about taking a break from work, or if they don't let me, quitting my job and going backpacking for a while.

In the last year, I did a few small solo trips (to other countries in Europe, staying in a hostel for 4-5 days.) I found those experiences intense, profound and very liberating. I know it's small fry comparatively but I never would have had the balls to do anything like that when I was younger.

Apart from that, it's pretty limited to week long holidays with family and mates. I've always wanted to travel, I grew up with my mum telling me all these mad stories about her year in Greece when she was 20. I just never got round to it. I had uni, I had a career, I had a sick parent, there was a pandemic. Whatever. But I am now getting that cold feeling in my stomach that if I don't do it now, I'll never do it. I don't have many responsibilities - I rent, I'm single. People older than me keep telling me now is the time to do it.

But I am struggling to think of where. I mean there's a whole world, it's so hard to narrow it down and I feel overwhelmed. I was wondering if people could help suggest places.

I'm incredibly fortunate to have inherited money after my mum died a few years ago so I would be comfortable splashing £10-15k ($12-18k) for a ""trip of a lifetime"". I would want to go for 3 to 6 months to justify the cost and the disruption when I get back. I think June would be the absolute earliest I could do it.

So I have a peanut allergy. Had it since infancy, carry two epipens, never had anything approaching anaphylaxis but I live in Ireland, we're not that peanut-y. So it's probably safe to say I should exclude SEA. Which is a bummer, cause I'd probably go there if it wasn't for the allergy.

I don't want to do Europe, as I live here and it's easy for me to do small trips. I don't want to do North America as it's v. expensive and the public transport is bad.

But apart from that, I really don't know. I'm not too bothered by weather. I love the idea of Latin America, like Chile/Argentina, the idea of going hiking in beautiful countrysides but then being able to go to cities sounds incredible. I'm a bit wary of the safety aspect though, and my spanish is only like A1/A2. 

I then thought about Japan, which was a childhood dream, but I thought 3 months might get difficult financially and it could get a bit samey, only being in one country. Maybe Japan/Taiwan/South Korea? Would probably cost a fortune though.

My most recent thought is New Zealand/Australia, maybe more for 3 months. I'd worry that again I would get bored, I like the outdoors but I do like culture and cities a lot too, and that I might regret spending that much money just to go somewhere so culturally similar.

Clearly the Kelty Cosmic (non-Dridown) 20 is very similar though I hear it's not as good.  Does anybody have any experience with how well the two actually do compare?

I am planning on solo camping the Tour Du Mont Blanc this summer. My questions is around the best way to go about booking the tail end of my trip, and is not specific to this trail other than the fact that I may have a flexible end date. For the last 3 nights, it will be a judgement call on how far I go/where I camp, which could result in an extra day potentially.

I am thinking it makes the most sense to give myself an extra day in planning travel, and book a hotel for the night of the extra day -&gt; book flight home the day after that. For the night before, I will book cheaper accommodation. That way if I finish early, I will have a place to stay, but I will not be wasting money on a nicer place if I do not finish in time.

backpacking,"Hello everyone. I'm going to be backpacking for 6 months or more around Chile, Peru, Bolivia and am planning lots of hiking and trekking, possibly at altitudes over 4500m. Trying to find some insurance companies which cover trekking above that even though this may only happen a few times. I have found some companies but have been quite shocked by prices - probably this is just my extreme naivety because I haven't done long-duration backpacking for a loooong time, and also have never tried to include activities like this,  but most of them are coming in at 1000 quid or more. Anyone have experience with this kind of insurance and have any suggestions, even if it's to say that seems about right and suck it up? I probably only need that higher level of cover for a short period but don't think the insurance companies I've looked at are that flexible. 

I'm a UK resident and also do have to declare mild asthma even though it's been 10 years since I've needed medication - this is possibly some of the issue as the cheaper options don't cover pre-existing conditions, but lots don't care unless you've had issues in the last 5 years.

backpacking,"# Hi everyone!

I was looking for any answers on how to shop like a local in different countries **on a budget,** because I feel like it's often a hassle to try different supermarkets, convenience stores or farmers markets until you start to get a feeling for which are the ones with actually good prices.

  
I found out that for many there is not much information out there.  Thats why I came up with the idea to create a post to incurage others to write a few sentences what you think is a good way to buy groceries in your country/Area or about some place which you are familiar with. That way we can create a collection at which somone can look at.

So feel free to comment about places that you know! :)   
Also please let me know if there is already some post like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I am originally from Germany:

# Germany

**Affordable Supermarkets:** Lidl, Aldi, Netto, Penny (All options here also have some organic products)  
**Mid-Range Supermarkets:** Rewe, Edeka, Real (All options here also have some organic products)  
**Orangic &amp; pricy supermarkets:** Alnatura (organic), Tegut (mostly organic)

**Drugstores:** DM, Rossmann, Müller (I feel like there is no big price difference, correct me if I'm wrong)  
Drugstores also often sell food, escpecially organic and vegan products. They are also relatively affordable,

Every bigger supermarket-chain has their own brand which is relatively cheap. Rewe-&gt;JA!, Tegut-&gt;Jeden Tag, Edeka-&gt;Gut &amp; Günstig, etc.

Farmer markets are a great spot for a stroll on a nice saturday morning! I don't go to markets often, but I feel like they are often more expensive then supermarkets.

Staying in hostels typically involves sharing a dormitory-style room with other travelers, although private rooms may also be available. You can expect to find communal areas such as kitchens, lounges, and bathrooms, and many hostels offer additional amenities like laundry facilities, free Wi-Fi, and organized activities.

To make the most of your stay, it's important to be respectful of your fellow travelers by keeping noise levels low and being considerate in shared spaces. Take advantage of the hostel's communal areas to meet new people and learn about the local culture. Join in on organized activities or ask the staff for recommendations on things to do in the area. Additionally, be sure to secure your belongings by using lockers or other provided storage options.

I recently was laid off from my job (working in tech) and think it would be a good time to get some travel in before I move to Australia and start working again. Since I plan to end my rental tenancy, and sell everything in NZ / store with parents I have no hard time constraint on this trip. I will have about $70K NZD saved up so won't have an issue money wise.

With the understanding Northern and Central Europe is going to be colder/wet around this time I thought I'd start my trip in Iberia working my way through southern France, northern Italy (incl Rome) and having a bit of a weeks 'break' in Split/Croatia. I was thinking the Iberia, France, Italy leg should be about a month, and the 'break' is on its own time schedule.

After the 'break' I want to start heading into central Europe. Start in Vienna, then Munich, Prague, and Berlin. I want to fit Krakow in too but might need to drop a city to do that. In the end I want to make way my way via Amsterdam and Paris up to London where I will stay for about a week before flying back to NZ. So fly into Lisbon or Madrid in Iberia then fly out London.

Also when I say 'at my own pace' here let me provide context: I have been looking into itineraries and have been trying to nail down a solid route to go. What I'm thinking though is I want to put together a general idea of a route which I will try stick to, but also let circumstances take me wherever. I don't know exactly how many days I want to spend everywhere, and I don't know who I will meet and what opportunities will come up. I also don't want to get burnt out, and I want to ensure I'm not jumping locations too quickly.

With that said I had a few questions I wanted to ask some other travellers:

1. Given the nature of my open-ended travel I am wondering if I should be buying a Eurrail pass or similar? I am worried about booking things too short notice and missing out or paying too much...
2. Same question as above but for hostels. What's the best practice here?
3. Any other tips?

backpacking,"Hey!  
Looking for an alround tent for me and my girlfriend. Have done some research and currently it appear to come down to the mountain hardwear mineral king 3 and nemo dagger 3p. Both are currently on sale at a store for roughly 160$ (Mineral King) and 350$ (Dagger).  
Short summary of my feelings at this point is that the Mineral King is good enough right now, but might get ""outdated"" if we want to go on longer hikes when we get more in to it.  
The nemo will probalby not be ""outdated"" as it has such a low weight and size, and as such a more allround choice. But the extra 200$ could be used on a new pack and/or sleeping-bag instead.  


I love the smartness of the bag separation for splitting weight on the dagger, or just simplifying weight distribution in my pack. But I'm a bit worried that there doesn't come a footprint with the dagger, and it seems quite hard (and expensive) to get a hold off. Anyone has experience with these tents? Are my durability concerns regarding the dagger just concerns? Anyone with anything else they would like to add? Or suggestions to other similarly priced options? With the dagger beeing 350$ I dont feel like the necessity to consider more expensive options than that, anyone who disagrees?  
About us: She has done quite a lot of car-camping, but not with packs more than day-trips. I have experience carrying heavy loads from my time in the army (30-40++ kg), so at first didn't consider a 3kg tent as a problem at all, but I do see a lot of backpackers stating that the biggest rookie mistake is to take to large/heavy gear and backpacks, and then downsizing fairly soon. We have just started to camp outside together on a couple of trips with hammocks. 

For now we do it for camping and appreciates luxury, but we dont have problem with walking to get to a nice camp-site. But not car camping as we like to get a little bit longer away from the road, and I don't think I would get the same nice ""camping"" feeling, as I get when we go into the woods. Doesn't have to be more than 500meters, although our last late night hammock trip ended up beeing 4-5km before we found a nice camp site. 

  
Can see us going for a hiking trip in the mountains over a week or so in the future (2-3 years +) if we dont have kids by then, so therefore wondering if we might end up having to by a new tent if we go for the Mineral King sooner than if we go for the dagger.

backpacking,"Hi! I'm just here to rant about my backpacking dreams. A little backstory.

  
I'm a 27 year old man and for the past five years it has felt like my life has been put on hold, so to speak. When I was 22 I dropped out of uni and broke up with my girlfriend and as a result I catapulted myself into a deep pit of despair. I was depressed, aimless, and full of anxiety. I have been struggling a lot with loneliness too as I don't have much of a social life (I'm living on a secluded place where all of my friends have moved away to bigger cities). For the past years I have done a lot of work on myself, soul-searching if you will, and I'm an entirely different person today then I was back then. I am in fact doing quite well now, but I'm starting to grow impatient as of late.   


I'm starting to become thorougly tired of the work I do and I've come to realize I despise the place I'm living in. I'm desperate to try something completely new. I know I want to dedicate my life to something else, and for the last 4 years I've frantically searched for that something ""else"" and now I what it is; I want to quit this job I hate and go to explore the world and never work the same occupation again.  
If not this, what then? I just know I need a long break from everything and find my footing. If not this, I am just supremely confused what else to do. I just know I am deeply unhappy in my current living situation and I just know a change of scenery is urgently needed. I'm sick of trying to accept the situation for what it is, when what it is, is complete and utter shit. I feel so stuck and alienated from people around me. They are content with so little. I just have an insatiable thirst to experience life, you know? I have no responsibilities, no house, no partner. I can do this, but I'm afraid. Very few people understand. All I know is my enthusiasm for life is slowly dwindling and this is the only choice that fills me with hope.  


So the plan would be a very loose one; go Interrailing for a month in europe then backpack across asia for 6 months or so. I would have no plans for what I will do when I get home. Obviously it's reckless, but I am so utterly sick of playing life safe. I've been on three solo travel journeys in Europe already and each time I've had such a magical time, met lots of great people, made close friendships and experienced so much personal growth.

For me, I have a few.

1) Vietnam:

I went to Central and Northen Vietnam last year. And for this year, I would like to travel to Dalat for its coffee plantation &amp; Phong Nha 4-6days caving expedition. In between, I am open to travel any places as long as it is not crowded at Hanoi or HCMC. However, I have already explored most of the places I want to visit in Vietnam and I will need to do more homework to find new places of interest btwn Dalat &amp; Phong Nha.

2) Laos/Cambodia:

I like to border cross btwn Laos &amp; Cambodia. Expenses are cheap &amp; affordable there &amp; I think I generally enjoy places that are relatively ""less travelled"" compared to the tourism giants within the Asia region like Japan/Korea &amp; etc. Hence, one of my travel destination. However, on the downside, I hate the hot &amp; humid weather.

3) China:

I have backpacked China before and I love it. There are so so many beautiful places in China and the possibilities are endless. I am Chinese and i love the authentic food there.

# Intro

Staying in a hostel provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds, make cherished international connections, broaden your understanding of the world, and realize the true smallness of our planet. It is an experience that can greatly broaden your horizons if you approach it with an open mind and a desire for personal and cultural growth.

In a hostel, you’ll be sharing a room with several individuals, with the rooms accommodating anywhere from 4 to 8 beds arranged in a bunk bed format. Guests typically stay for a period of 5 days to a week, although some choose to extend their stay for several months. As a result, you’ll be surrounded by a constantly rotating cast of characters, some of whom you’ll become friends with, while others may simply pass through.

You’ll meet some people who you exchange Instagram handles with, only to later forget each other’s account names, while others will become cherished foreign friends that you’ll keep in touch with and perhaps even reunite with in their home country or yours.

However, some guests may be noisy or untidy, making them poor roommates. For instance, someone who stays up late talking on the phone with family or a significant other can make it difficult to get a good night’s sleep, which can detract from their overall friendliness.

I wrote this to help you have some Ideas in mind about what you will encounter and also perhaps it puts a smile on your face and makes your day brighter. So let's get to it.

# 1- Bed Quakes

I’m sure you have some preconceived notions about what I’m about to describe, but let me provide a clear definition. These folks may appear normal and innocent at first glance or throughout their stay, but they can reveal their true, disruptive nature only to the unlucky guest who has the lower bunk. It typically unfolds like this: you go to bed, settle in, and are ready to fall asleep.

Everything seems peaceful and calm. Your eyes start to feel heavy as you drift off to sleep. But suddenly, after an hour or so, your peaceful slumber is interrupted by violent shaking of the bed, as if there were an earthquake happening. These artificially-induced quakes can last anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 seconds and can range from a magnitude of 5 to 10. You wake up, disoriented and frightened, before transitioning to an irritated state. You wait for the shaking to stop, hoping to return to sleep. If you’re lucky, you’ll eventually drift back off, but only for a a while until the shaking starts again. It’s thoughtless and inconsiderate to not take into account the well-being of the person sleeping below you. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to identify this type of roommate until you happen to sleep in the lower bunk. You’ll feel what horse play means by all means.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2- Plastic people

Are they made out of plastic? No but they have a strong fixation with plastic bags. Once you begin to notice that not a single hour goes by without them checking and rummaging through their plastic bags, it’s already too late. This behavior can last for several minutes or more, repeatedly waking you up during the night. They are often referred to as “plastic people” due to their excessive love towards plastic bags.

# 3- Runners

This type of person doesn’t enter the room like a ordinary person. They rush in, slamming the door open as if they’re being pursued by a group of one eyed demons. But don’t be fooled into thinking that this will be the end of it. If you think they will settle down after closing the door, you are greatly mistaken with your drowsy and bewildered eyes just opened. Most likely, they will return to the room to retrieve something from their locker, put on their shoes, change their clothes, and so on.

They will do so as if those demons that are chasing them will find their way into the room soon. They run around and try to pick up their stuff, Things drop out of their hands and they repeatedly say: Shit… Fuck… etc. You can either ask them politely to be quieter or wait until they finish and leave. However, they will likely repeat this behavior as they are always in a rush and tend to forget things, requiring multiple trips back to the room. This can be a frequent occurrence as I have personally experienced it several times with different runners.

# 4- Adventurer travelers

They are the type of travelers you want to meet. These people may be YouTubers, photographers, bloggers, or individuals with a wealth of cultural knowledge and a desire to expand their understanding of life through travel. Unlike strict disciplinarians, they are relaxed, keep themselves clean, have an awareness of their surroundings, are considerate of others, and are highly intelligent. They make for great traveling companions, with plenty of interesting stories to share and creative ideas for having fun.

# 5- Skunks

Having a skunk roommate is like being the victim of chemical weapons or being around a highly displeased skunk. They bring an unpleasant odor to the room, much like a skunk. These types of roommates can make the living space unbearable and uninviting.

For example, I once had a roommate who was a serious cyclist and also happened to be a legit skunk. He never took showers, never washed his clothes or towel, and let the towel stink like a landfill. It hung on his bed, giving off an odor so potent, you’d think a skunk had taken up residency. It was a nightly battle, having to endure that stench while trying to get some shut-eye. Talk about a nightmare before bedtime.

He unload his gut like he’s hosting a celebration of puking up boiled eggs. Even while he was sitting in the lobby, I knew he was there just by the pungent odor of a rotting body that permeated the air before I even entered the lobby. Anyways, I slept in the lobby until the day he left. He stayed for 4 days and, I must say, he was the worst person I encountered during my travels.

# 6- Expanders

They begin by hanging their towel and clothes on top of their bed, eventually taking up all the space. Their open suitcase is on the ground and their belongings are scattered around it. You’ll find yourself stumbling over their things on the floor as you try to reach your own bed. They don’t think twice about bringing all their food and drinks and placing them near their bed. If they’re on the lower bunk and the top bunk is empty, they’ll use it to hang even more items, while still keeping an eye on your side of the room and its empty top bunk.

They behave like they’ve just won the jackpot in a game show and now they’re the proud owners of everything in sight! Even the common fridge is not safe from their territorial instincts. They’ll keep taking over more and more space, like a balloon on a hot air vent. They expand and expand if they see no needle around.

# 7- Podcasters

Once I had two roommates who started chatting at 8 PM. It was okay, nobody was in a hurry to sleep. I, however, had things to do, so I went to the lobby for a few hours and returned around 12. To my surprise, they were still talking, in their native language. To avoid any kind of conflict, I left for the lobby again. When I returned at 2:20 AM, they were still at it. I spoke with the night shift manager and had a conversation with them as well

They finally stopped speaking, but the fact that they didn’t care about the time or whether others were trying to sleep was a concerning issue. One of them was quite attached to his plastic bag. He had a deep love for it, much like some grandmothers have for their possessions. He would randomly search through it, not caring about the time or if others were sleeping.

""What time is it? Are others sleeping?"" These were questions he asked himself, but always answered with a dismissive “Fuck them"".

People are running around in a panic, looking worried and stressed out. It’s like a scene straight out of a horror movie, with everyone wondering “Who will be the next victim?”

Apparently, there’s a new guest at the hostel who seems to have a knack for leaving their mark, or should I say “stains,” around the toilets. I’ve witnessed the aftermath of their bathroom antics, with poop stains on the toilet paper holder, walls, and even door handles. And it doesn’t end with just one toilet. They move from one to the next, rendering each one useless in a matter of hours. Just imagine trying to use a toilet that has poop smears on the seat, door handle, and toilet paper holder. Not a pleasant sight

Most people prefer to suffer or go out and find another toilet instead of going into this poopy nightmare. You may wonder what these serial poopers look like, and what kind of people they are. I’ve encountered some during my travels and let me tell you, they’re just like you and me… except for their toilet habits. They could be charming and charismatic, but little do you know, they’re just hiding their true “brown” colors.

# 9- The classic “I don’t like it here, I want to go back” folks

Meet the ‘Homesick Hearts’ — they repeat their lament of “I don’t like it here, I wanna go back” multiple times a day. Yet, they’re still here months later. Perhaps they’re running from something back home, be it cultural, political or financial issues. Or maybe they’re searching for a new place to call home. Either way, it’s hard to fault them for having those issues.

They simply need to find refuge in another country and a stay in a hostel is preferable to renting a room or house. Hostels offer a clean and organized environment, as the cleaning staff ensures that the facilities are kept tidy. If they can locate a well-maintained hostel with an affordable rate, they will likely make it their permanent residence. However, the negative aspect of this type of personality is that they tend to be unhappy and uneasy. Some may be unable to leave the hostel due to depression, financial difficulties, or fear of being apprehended by authorities. Others may not have financial concerns and may engage in partying, but they still complain 24/7 and have a negative view of the country they are staying in.

# 10- Potential Future CEOs

This one is interesting. You likely want to associate with them. They are diligent and have both short-term and long-term aspirations. They can often be found working late into the night in the lobby, putting in long hours to reach their goals. They might own a company located in another nation or be working on a startup endeavor.

They are excellent conversationalists and make great friends. I met one such person who still remains a close friend of mine. He abstains from alcohol, opts for healthy food and drinks, and has a patient and understanding demeanor towards different situations and individuals. He is also eager to discover the city’s historical marvels. We occasionally arrange tea parties, where we invite guests to try different types of tea while relaxing to some soothing spiritual music and engaging in lively discussions.

# 11- Spies

Imagine you’re staying in a hostel in Mexico during the time of the Ukrainian invasion. A Russian man enters, fluent in English like a native speaker. He is highly sociable and loves to chat. He tells you that he used to be in the Russian army but got out a few months ago. He mentions his mother is Mexican, but whenever you ask about her, he brushes it off, saying she immigrated many years ago and doesn’t like to talk about Mexico. He stays at the hostel for over a month. As an American staying at the same hostel, you might feel like you’re being watched, and catch glimpses of him checking out your room when you’re not there and have left the door open.

Over time, as people grew more suspicious of him and bombarded him with constant questions, he finally confessed that he was still in the army. He explained that his stay in Mexico was arranged with the government and that he checked in with the Russian embassy daily. He had no Mexican mother, and his mission was simply to gather some minor information. This was a lot for the average traveler to take in, but it’s clear that hostels, as international gathering places, provide a perfect opportunity for spies to gather information about people from different countries, neighboring nations, and the country they’ve traveled to as a let’s “tourist”.

It’s unsettling, isn’t it?

# 12- Partier

They are the stuff of legend for their all-day sleeping and all-night partying ways. Bar-hopping is their favorite pastime and hanging out with them will guarantee you a wild ride. They are one of the most recommended groups of people to spend time with, and trust us, it’s worth it. Just be prepared to temporarily embrace your inner night owl and say goodbye to your regular sleep schedule. With them, you’ll make a ton of new friends and create memories to last a lifetime. Just make sure to pace yourself and stay hydrated, because these party animals don’t slow down until the sun comes up!

# 13- Elephant in the room

They can be great individuals. In fact, the ones I’ve encountered were usually humble and kind, with the unfortunate side effect of being snorers. Of course, it’s not their fault, but it’s not easy for others either. After a long day, a strenuous walk, or a tour of another city, you want nothing more than a good night’s rest, but the loud snoring of your roommate can make that impossible. The sound is so loud, it’s as if they’re shouting, and no amount of earplugs or headphones can block it out, not even with the soothing sounds of meditation music.

I once experienced this myself. I was sharing a dorm room with three other people and it felt like there was an elephant in the room… an extremely loud screaming elephant that couldn’t be ignored at all! We had no choice but to abandon our beds and sleep in the lobby. The next day, I had a chat with the snorer and, much to my surprise, they were actually one of the coolest people I met in that hostel. It was a classic case of “daytime friends, nighttime foes”.

# 14- Call center agents

They are the ones you never see without their phone in hand. Not just checking their messages or scrolling through their Instagram feed, but constantly on a call, occupying the same seat in the lobby and speaking in a language only they seem to understand. No matter what time of day you enter the lobby, there they are, seated in the same spot, their butt shape molded into the cushion, steadfastly holding their phone and deeply engaged in the front-line of their phone calls. It’s as if they’ve taken a vow to never let go of that seat, or their phone for that matter.

It’s actually an ugly scene, but it can look like like a dramatic soap opera playing out in real life! And all over a phone call. These people are truly masters of multitasking, juggling their phone conversation with making exaggerated hand gestures, slamming the table, and even throwing in a good shout and cuss word here and there. Bystanders can’t help but learn a few new words in their native language, even if they don’t want to.

# 15- No vital sign people

This kind of person can be a man child sitting in a corner playing games. Can be some one working with his lap top. An IT specialist or a freelancer or just some one who didn't find his home a good place to check his Instagram stories so he’s come to a hostel in another country and never get his eyes off of his phone, while he is in the hostel.

They’re like ghosts haunting the lobby, but instead of spooky noises, you hear the sound of rapid mouse clicks and the occasional outburst of frustration at an in-game defeat. You try to offer them a snack or say hello, but they just nod their head and continue on with their virtual world, completely oblivious to the real world around them. The only time they resurface from their gaming trance is when it’s time to retire to their room for the night, leaving their laptop behind like a security blanket. And the next day, they’re back at it again, butt in chair, hand on mouse, eyes glued to the screen. It’s a never-ending cycle of game, sleep, game, sleep.

We are starting in London and are planning on taking trains south and east to Paris, Switzerland, Munich, Salzburg, and Vienna. We were going to fly from Vienna to Istanbul but now I am wondering if it would be worth taking trains instead so we can see more of the region by land. I think it would be so cool to be able to say that we traveled all the way from London to Istanbul via train.

We would take a train from Vienna to Budapest and that part seems pretty easy. But I am getting stuck on figuring out what the best way to get from Budapest to Istanbul would be. Would it be better to go through Romania (via Bucharest) or through Serbia (via Sofia)? Or something else? Or better to just fly? We have about a week in our itinerary that we could devote to getting from Budapest to Istanbul so we could stop overnight in some of the cities along the way. Or if we fly we would just spend more time in Budapest and more time in Istanbul.

I am seeing something online about the Bosphorus express from Bucharest to Istanbul - does anyone have experience with that?

backpacking,"**The Route**

* Having handed in my work devices on Friday 11th February 2022 I was on a plane Monday 14th and landed in Tijuana, Baja California by Tuesday 15th. My plan was a simple one; to travel south, avoiding planes where possible, and to see how far I’d get with the time (&amp; budget!) available, exploring the points of interest which piqued my curiosity most. My reasoning for selecting this part of the world was also relatively straightforward; I have family there, and while I’d visited for short periods previously, I’d not done so solo nor for such an extended period of time. In the end the trip was to take me through 10 countries, over 60 separate locations and as far as Quilotoa, an extinct volcano now with a lake in the former crater, a couple of hours south of Quito, Ecuador.

**Highlights**

* **La Huasteca Potosina, Mexico.** About 6 hours’ drive north-east from Mexico City located in the state of San Luis Potosí La Huasteca Potosina is an area of outstanding natural beauty dotted with turquoise coloured waterfalls and rivers. Far from the much more renown Yucatán or Pacific coasts this region is entirely unafflicted by tourist overcrowding and also unexpectedly home to a British cultural contribution, the surrealist garden of Edward James, “La Pozas”. A wealthy and eccentric aristocrat James considered the natural environment to lend itself to a surrealist style and began construction of the garden in 1948, aiming for the structures to blend in with the landscape and numerous orchids and other plants housed there. Construction ceased in 1984 with his passing and underway structures were deliberately left incomplete, further enhancing the surrealist feel.
* **El Mirador, El Petén, Guatemala.** While Tikal is certainly the best known and most restored Mayan site in this north-eastern region of Guatemala, it is far from the only one. Indeed, it is estimated that there are more than 1500 ruins in the region, with evermore being discovered and recovered from the jungle thanks to LIDAR technology. El Mirador (“the lookout”), still actively being worked on by Richard Hansen’s archeological team from the University of Idaho, is one such site and requires a full 5 or 6 days to visit. Significantly older than Tikal it is in fact best described as a network of ruins as opposed to a sole ruin, with structures dating from as far back as 1000 BC to as recent as 250 AD. Aside from the archeological and historical interest of the site, there’s also plenty of flora and fauna to observe – and watch out for - in the heart of the jungle. While like many a prior Western visitor I was initially confused by the guides’ choice of jeans for a hot and humid climate on active days the reasoning became more apparent after sighting three snakes, two of which were venomous, within 24 hours.
* **El Castillo, Nicaragua.** At my first stop in Nicaragua, the colonial city of León, I'd picked up a Lonely Planet for the country and noted the opportunity to get a little more off the beaten track, away from the well-trodden path along the pan-American highway on the Pacific side. This included the opportunity to wander down the San Juan river, which essentially marks the southern border with Costa Rica. From Ometepe, an island formed from two volcanoes, then, I hopped on one of the twice weekly overnight ferries to San Carlos, a town at the point where lake Ometepe flows out into the river. Arriving at San Carlos early in the morning I had a brief look around before continuing along on a separate boat down the river to El Castillo. A tiny village built on the riverfront it feels, even more than much of Nicaragua, like a step back in time with no cars, motorbikes or other vehicles in sight. In addition to being stunningly located in the heart of the jungle it also has a storied history due to its importance as a strategic defensive location along the river due to its proximity to some natural rapids. Indeed, its name, ""the castle"", is due to the Spanish colonial fort located there, and which over the centuries was the site of numerous conflicts including a successful siege by a 22 year-old Captain Horatio Nelson in 1780.
* **Travelling from Panama to Colombia by catamaran.** With the Darién gap being one of the most inhospitable environments in the region  due to the natural conditions, let alone the human factors, there are surprisingly few options to make the journey from Panama across to South America, and vice versa. And with no commercial ferry service running there are in fact only 2 (legal) options: to fly or by boat. Enjoying the luxury of time I therefore selected the latter option, a full 5 day trip by catamaran with another 15 or so passengers, a Captain and his first mate (and also wife!). While the open sea portion of the journey was to only take around 30 hours the real highlight of the trip is prior to this (if going north to south) when exploring the San Blas islands off the coast of Panama, home to the indigenous Guna Yala. An archipelago of 378 islands, the majority are uninhabited and pristinely maintained with the Guna protecting the area from any further development.

**Lowlights**

* **Getting sick.** Having had a seemingly trouble free first few months I eventually fell to the inevitable stomach illness any backpacker can anticipate on a less familiar diet in another part of the world. Less pleasant was the suspected case of Covid I had when in a small town in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Attempting to get hold of a test also brought home the challenge many in the region would’ve had during the pandemic, as I soon found both of the only pharmacies in the town were out of stock. Further, at a subsequent enquiry elsewhere I was to discover a lateral flow test cost 250 MXN pesos (almost £11!), slightly more than the daily minimum wage.
* **Driving standards.** Suffice to say, the quality of roads, adherence to speed limits and general driving standards were fairly variable throughout the countries I passed through, with Guatemala and Colombia particularly involving some rather interesting and bumpy trips. A quick google of some driving statistics does in fact appear to validate this perception, with the former ranking the 8th worst country globally for road traffic deaths, and the latter the 3rd worst for road quality!
* … almost nothing else apart from that!

**Unexpected Gem**

* **Nicaragua.** The second-poorest country in the Western hemisphere after Haiti, Nicaragua is also one of the long-standing leftist regimes in the regime and once more under the presidency of Daniel Ortega, one of the original revolutionaries of the 1979 Sandinista revolution which overthrew the USA-backed Somoza regime. This unique political and social climate is not hidden from view, with stencils displaying iconography of the revolutionary state aplenty in cities such as León. Stark examples would include ones such as that of Sandino (the original 1930s revolutionary) with the heel of his boot atop the hat of a literally downtrodden Uncle Sam. Aside from that the country is also host to spectacular biodiversity yet often overshadowed by its southern neighbour, Costa Rica, which takes all those plaudits.

**Most Unexpected Moments**

* **Hurricane Agatha.** Having grown up in the climatic and natural safe-haven of the UK I’d always considered natural disasters and extreme weather events to be almost abstract occurrences and not something I’d ever experience myself. This was to quickly change last May when the predicted trajectory for a brewing hurricane rapidly changed from a forecast landfall 80km away to directly at the town of Mazunte where I found myself at the time. The strongest Pacific hurricane to make landfall in the month of May since records began, it fortunately failed to reach Category 3 status, but was certainly strong enough for my liking as a Category 2 with 1 minute sustained winds of 110mph. Safely ensconced in a rented room in the centre of town, and with all power having cut in the early stages, there was no option but to sit things out and listen to the torrential rains and wind, and hope the taped-up windows would hold strong! While a novel experience for myself, it also served to bring to life the realities of a world in which atypical weather events outside their expected windows, may, in fact, start to become rather more typical.

**Most Budget Friendly** 

* **Nicaragua.** With it easy enough to find a hostel for under $10 a night and sometimes for as little as $5 it’s certainly a backpacker and budget friendly destination. And with £1 exchanging for 40 Nicaraguan Córdobas, it’s also relatively easy to eat well with a reasonable meal around the 150 córdobas mark.
* **Colombia.** While unfortunately one of the emerging markets with a currency which devalued most in 2022, falling 16% against the dollar, this of course makes it a more inviting destination for outsiders. Further, with a security situation that has markedly improved over the years and a second peace treaty in the works following on from the 2016 agreement, it’s an ideal destination for a restricted budget.

**Most Family Friendly** 

* **Costa Rica.** Probably the most well-known of the Central American countries, it’s for good reason, with some of the most accessible flora and fauna you’ll find anywhere in the world. Particular highlights and examples of this include the Manuel Antonio nature park on the pacific coast where you can wander wooden boarding among the canopy spotting sloths, spider monkeys and toucans, and see where the jungle meets the sea.
* **Guatemala.** Nestled below Mexico, Guatemala offers the perfect blend of coast, volcanoes, jungle and history. While not a complete stranger to violent troubles, including in the not too distant past, it’s now considered one of the steadier countries in the region with the colonial-style city of Antigua safe to wander at all times of day and night.

**Most Interesting Animal Spotted**

* **Oncilla.** Of the six cat species native to Panama (the others being the jaguar, cougar, ocelot, jaguarundi &amp; margay) this was the only one I hadn’t heard of, yet to be the only one I’d spot live in the flesh. Unwittingly setting off at an ideal early time to spot this nocturnal animal, I’d been on a trail to reach the peak of Volcan Barú, the highest point in Panama, when the bright, reflective eyes of what I thought were an owl caught my eye. Closer inspection, however, revealed it to be a cat with a spotted pelt and about half the size of a domestic cat – an oncilla.",Trip Summary: 10 Months in Latin America,,TheWearyRodent,,0,2/10/2023 14:57

backpacking,"Hey,

I started traveling in October 2019 and I came back home in December 2022. I started a 1 year travel that ended up lasting 3 years.

Since I came back i've been here and there to visit family and friends that I haven't seen for that long.

But now, it's weird. I'm not feeling unhappy, but I'm litteraly going to bed at 9am and waking up a 6pm.

It's like I was avoiding doing stuff here, I'm not interested in finding a job right away, or going back to the ""normal life"" anytime soon.

I mean, I could do it, but I'm not interested at all.

Before traveling I was a geek; and during thoses 3 years I haven't played a single video game. Now that I am back I'm just playing all night and smoking weed, because i just couldn't do that during the travel.

I'm happy not to be on the road again, I wanted a break from thoses night bus, meeting people everyday, forcing yourself to do stuff everyday. I'm enjoying my break.

But somehow, I'm wondering if it's not the famous ""Return Depresssion"" that is hiting me without me noticing it.

I'm also worried because i'm living at my mother's place and since I came back everyone is asking her what i'm doing right now and what are my plans. She has a tough life and I don't think she is very pleased answering that I do nothing and have no plan for the future.

backpacking,"A backpacker is a type of traveler who prioritizes budget and adventure over luxury. They are known for carrying everything they need on their back, as they travel from one place to another. Backpacking is a popular way to see the world for those who are seeking new experiences and want to immerse themselves in different cultures.

**Types of Backpackers**There are several different types of backpackers, each with their own unique travel style. Here are some of the most common types:

1. **Budget Backpacker:** As the name suggests, budget backpackers prioritize cost savings over comfort and convenience. They typically stay in budget accommodations such as hostels and camping sites, and eat at local markets or street vendors.
2. **Adventure Backpacker:** Adventure backpackers are thrill-seekers who are always on the lookout for new challenges and experiences.

&gt;Traveling is one of life's greatest pleasures, but it can also be expensive. However, with a bit of creativity and resourcefulness, it is possible to make money while on the road. Whether you are traveling for work or for leisure, there are several ways you can turn your travels into a source of income. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. **Freelance Work:** With the rise of remote work, it has become easier than ever to make money while traveling. If you have a skill such as writing, graphic design, or programming, you can offer your services to clients around the world through freelance platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer. This way, you can work from anywhere with an internet connection and earn a steady income while exploring new destinations.
2. **Online Teaching:** If you are proficient in a particular subject or language, you can offer tutoring or language lessons online through websites such as iTalki or Verbling. You can earn money while sharing your knowledge with students from around the world.

We enjoy tent camping and recently bought a tent camper to make camping with small children (18 mo &amp; expecting #2) easier, but we don't see the camper as a forever thing. I'm taking my time to learn about backpacking so I can help equip our family when the time comes for us to try it, but I'm starting from a knowledge base of 0. Some questions I have:

1. How to even start if you've never done it before?
2. What age is reasonable to expect your children to be able to handle even an overnight trip?
3. What rules/regulations, if any, are there around backpacking?
4. What unspoken code of conduct rules are common among backpackers?
5. How do you go to the bathroom?
6. How do you get safe water?
7. How do you keep yourself and supplies safe from predators in areas without trees or bear poles?
8. Would something like kayak or canoe camping, where you can potentially carry more gear, be a good way to ease into it (and easier on little feet)?

Don't have a defined duration but will be there for multiple months hopefully. I'm planning to do hiking and camping, including multi day treks, as well as just everyday travel. Been reading about water filters and purification and was intending to get something like the Sawyer or Katadyn as well as some purification tablets or drops but I had some questions if anyone could help me out? Obviously I know bottled water is a simple solution when not hiking but I'd like to try to be a bit more waste-friendly and use filtered tap water and re-usable bottles if possible.

1. Lots of people posting in other discussions about similar topics say they get some kind of filter which only filters bacteria/protozoa/particulate and then tablets as back up, but the filters won't get rid of viruses so surly the tablets should be essential, not back up? Although I presume they mean back up in case something hairband to their filter. So my next question is...
2. How concerned should I be about viruses in those areas? Does anyone know if any info online  specifically about risks in particular areas? I've had a little look but couldn't find anything specific. I'm familiar with all the time/health/taste concerns/cons that people have with purifier tablets/drops, and I'm assuming that people just weigh that against the risk of getting a virus? 

I guess what I'm ultimately asking in an unnecessarily long winded way is should I be purifying water all the time if I don't use bottled water, instead of just filtering?

backpacking,"Hello :) 24m here. I've been working in the USA for a bit and decided it was time for me to follow my dreams and travel the world. One of my coworkers told me that one of her friends applied for an Australian work visa and got accepted quite promptley. I applied that night and got accepted a few days later! So now i've quit my job and have a flight out to Melbourne come late February. I would like to travel for at least 6 months, but i have O plans other than backpack Australia for a few months, then Asia and hopefully Europe for a bit. I have a few questions and if there are any experienced backpackers here, i would LOVE some advice.

1. Is it bad that I sort of know what I want to do, but have absolutely no concrete plans? Should I be booking hostels 3-4 weeks in advance, or will i be okay booking a bed 1 week in advance? I feel like lots of travelers know exactly where they want to stay, what they want to see, and what the want to do. Like i said I have a few dreams of what I what to do, but no plans whatso ever. 

2. Im staying at the Space Hotel for the first week, then i was thinking about Europa the next week Europa is a little cheaper than the Space Hotel, but both are still a bit pricey ($40-$42USD a night). I wanted to stay in the CBD area for the first two weeks, but then i like the idea of getting a hostel closer to the beach. Im a surfer and would LOVE to stay in a hostel closer to a great surfing beach in Melbourne, so if anyone knows of any hostels that are located near a good surf break and that are clean, safe, cheaper, and backpacker friendly, let me know!

3. I love the idea of driving from Melbourne to Byron Bay. If I were to do this at a slow pace, bouncing from surf break to surf break over the course of 3-4 weeks, do you think i should buy a beater car or rent a car. My budget for renting a car would be about $40-$50 USD a day.

Light enough. I'm not a gram weenie and I'll be using this for bikepacking mostly

One of my coworkers told me that one of her friends applied for an Australian work visa and got accepted quite promptley. I applied that night and got accepted a few days later!

So now i've quit my job and have a flight out to Melbourne come late February. I would like to travel for at least 6 months, but i have 0 plans other than backpack Australia for a few months, then Asia and Europe for a bit.  I have a few questions and if there are any experienced backpackers here, i would LOVE some advice.

1.  Is it bad that I sort of know what i want to do, but have absolutely no concrete plans?  Should I be booking hostels 3-4 weeks in advance, or will i be okay booking a bed 1 week in advance?
2. Im staying at the Space Hotel for the first week, then i was thinking about Europa the next week. Europa is a little cheaper than the Space Hotel, but both are still a bit pricey.  I wanted to stay in the CBD area for the first two weeks, but then i like the idea of getting a hostel closer to the beach. Im a surfer and would LOVE to stay in a hostel closer to a great surfing beach in Melbourne, so if anyone knows of any hostels that are clean, safe, cheaper, and backpacker friendly, let me know!
3. I love the idea of driving from Melbourne to Byron Bay. If I were to do this at a slow pace, bouncing from surf break to surf break over the course of 3-4 weeks, do you think i should buy a beater car or rent a car. My budget for renting a car would be about $40-$50 USD a day.

backpacking,"My wife doesn't really wear makeup, and she's not bring a ton of shoes or dresses or anything, but I'm just kind of shocked how different our weight is for what is, some face cleaning products and menstrual related items?

&amp;#x200B;

This is for 2 weeks in Ecuador, involving a 3-day hike (staying at hostels, no tents needed and able to dry/rinse clothes, eat dinner, and shower each day), and then a few days diving and at the beach. So we do need cold+warm weather gear. 

&amp;#x200B;

My pack weight is about 11 pounds. Roughly, that is with 

* 1 pair of pants, worn
* 1 pair of shorts, 
* Multiple shirts
   * 1 tanktop
   * 1 hiking long sleeve
   * 1 fleece long sleeve
* 3 pairs of socks (+ 1 worn)
* 2 pairs underwear, 1 pair of hiking underwear
* 1 small towel
* \~6000 calories worth of snacks for both of us
* Rain paints + rain jacket (we have same lightweight pair)
* Both of our toothbrushes/toothpaste, our shampoo and bodywash

So again, my weight is \~ 11 pounds while I'm carrying all of our food and hygeine/cleaning products, and hers rang in \~ 18 pounds! 

I went through her pack with her, didn't weigh each individual item or anything, she had two pairs of hiking pants, we got rid of one, a hiking shirt for each day, we got rid of the heaviest one, her face cleaning products were still all in the original glass containers so we put just what she needs into ziploc baggies, afterwards she is down to \~16 pounds, but I'm still kind of shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

We still need to carry water, I'll have the majority of that anyway but I want to help her as much as possible. If any of you have a lighterpack I'd love to see it!

&amp;#x200B;

I'll keep grabbing stuff to lower her weight, but we are going to be hitting almost 13,000 ft elevation/4000m on our hike so I really wanted to minimize both our weights to avoid any altitude problems.","Women travel backpackers, what is your typical base weight?

backpacking,"I've got a good few backpacking trips under my belt now, and last September my partner joined me for her first trip. We went for a fairly short journey to Talapus Lake in Washington. My partner suffers from chronic migraines and unfortunately got one going up the trail. By the time we reached the day area of the lake, they were just about ready to vomit and bail. To add to the suffering, they stepped on a hornet nest on our way to the camp spot and got stung 7 times. It was about 2 am when they were feeling better and did some stargazing with me. The following day went well, and we got back without issues. The weather was great at 70-75 Fahrenheit, with clear skies and low wind on both days. 

Overall it wasn't the worst experience, but the main kicker for my partner was the migraine. Factors she thought might have made it for her might have been not hydrating enough before the hike, the strain of the exercise, and eating a heavy meal beforehand. She drank ample water and took migraine pills to mitigate it, but didn't have much effect. We're training a bit, and bringing electrolyte supplements for our next venture.

Is Malta popular around backpackers my age? 

From what I could gather while researching, the only campground on the island isn't great, but those reviews are 3 years old... so has anyone recently gone?

As I know 2 weeks is a little long for Malta, do you have any suggestions of destinations to go to which aren't too far away?

backpacking,"Good Morning,

A few buddies and I have a trip planned for Yosemite June 19-22. We have a permit, etc. However, due to the snow this year I thought it might be a good idea to have a backup plan in case Tioga Rd is not open yet when we go.

Our plan is to go to the Tuolumne of the Grand Canyon from White Wolfe to Tuolumne and do that hike in 4 days.  However, in recent years Tioga Rd ( the road to get the White Wolf) have not been open by June 19.  I was considering trying to get a permit for the Hetch Hetchy loop for that same time frame, but I am not sure if snow closures would still be an issue there.

Does anyone have any loop trail ideas outside of Yosemite Nat Park around 25-35 miles that would most likely be doable during a high snow year?  My buddies and I are all in our upper 50's and have all backpacked before.  I have already looked at Rae Lakes Loop ( no permits available) the lost coast trail ( no permits available).

backpacking,"Are you looking for the top reasons why sports are important for us? If so, this popular blog post is the perfect read for you. Here, we’ll take a look at the five key reasons why sports are necessary for us, and how they can help us lead better lives. Keep reading to learn more!

**1) They keep us physically active**

Sports are a great way to stay physically active. With the help of regular physical activity, we can keep our bodies healthy and strong. According to the American Heart Association, physical activity helps us to maintain a healthy weight and reduce our risk of heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions. Additionally, physical activity releases endorphins that can elevate mood and reduce stress. 

As part of a regular fitness routine, participating in sports can help you stay in shape, increase your endurance and strength, and boost your overall health. Whether you choose to play on a team or work out solo, engaging in some form of physical activity is one of the best blog tips you can use to take care of your body.

**2) They teach us teamwork**

One of the most important aspects of [sports](https://www.popularblogtips.com/) is that they teach us the value of teamwork. Working together as a team and achieving success can be one of the most rewarding experiences, and it’s something that can be learned through sports. Teamwork teaches us how to work together to achieve a common goal and become a better team in the process. This can be applied to all areas of life and can help us form strong relationships with others. In this increasingly digital world, many of us are stuck inside with little social interaction, making it even more important to practice teamwork so that we can better understand how to collaborate with others. According to a popular blog, “When we engage in team sports, we learn valuable lessons about communication, cooperation, and problem-solving. We learn how to work with others, to respect their opinions, to trust their judgment, and to compromise when necessary.” These valuable skills will stay with us forever and help us become better people.

**3) They help us relieve stress**

One of the most [popular blog](https://www.popularblogtips.com/) topics in recent years has been mental health, and rightfully so. Stress is something that many of us experience on a daily basis, and can have a detrimental effect on our physical and emotional wellbeing. Fortunately, engaging in physical activity like sports can be a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. Participating in sports can give us a sense of purpose, while also providing an outlet for our frustrations and worries. The physical activity helps to release endorphins, which can lift our mood and help us to feel better. Additionally, engaging in a team sport allows us to make friends and build strong relationships, which can also help us to cope with stress in a healthy way.",The top 5 reasons why sports are necessary for us,,popularblogtips,,0,2/3/2023 4:24

It’s 10,000 ft at base camp and 14,000 ft at peak in White River National Forest…. In March. ~25” average snowfall in March in area.

I don’t have much experience with winter backpacking, and I’m worried I’m underestimating just how much snow and ice there will be.

I’d plan on buying snow pants, crampons, waterproof jacket, and ice axe for this trip (on top of my winter ready gear, like sleeping system and warm clothes). I’m worried that isn’t enough.

my issue is, because of grad school and covid i haven’t backpacked in a while… i am in pretty good health, but i have knees that like to give out sometimes and have to use a walking stick most days. 

so. any advice on if i should actually “backpack” (use a backpack as my luggage) or should i invest in a rolling carry on? i think both have their pros and cons…

the rolling carry on seems VERY cumbersome if/WHEN i have to navigate steps.

backpacking,"If I get roasted it’s fine, I’ve already been through hell it can’t be any worse. Has anyone ever made an absolute tragedy of a decision backpacking and it ruined their entire trip?

I backpacked the WCT with an ex-coworker who was also a part of my friend group, though we never built a friendship. I’ve kept up with her social media after we both moved on to better jobs, she regularly posts her solo adventures. She wanted to go on a group trip right before she got married and when I heard it was going to be a challenge, I impulsively said yes. She picked out the dates which would give us four days on the trail and I was concerned about it because online says most people take 5-7 days. She told me it was fine, we would just have to grind out the miles and all we had to do was 10 miles a day. Worried I wouldn’t be able to keep up with the group, I started training pretty seriously. I get airline tickets, permits and everything and everyone in the group (including her fiancé) drops out except her. I tried my hardest to start building a friendship but I couldn’t help but feel like all my attempts were met with snarky replies. For instance, when I texted her photos of me training with my pack she replied with “I HIGHLY suggest you get actual rain proof gear”. I asked if she was training to try and see if I was up to par but it became clear she wasn’t planning on training with her pack because she was doing cross-fit classes 5 days of the week. She tells me her fiancé is alluding to the fact she may have to carry me through the trail. He has done the trail before and I didn’t want to hold her back so I trained harder.

We get on the trail and it is pretty clear from the start she is not physically prepared whatsoever. The first five miles takes us almost the entire day. It’s starting to get dark and she’s getting cold and worried but also wants to keep taking breaks and is walking EXTREMELY slow (my boyfriend looked at my GoPro data and we were averaging .5 miles/hour) We are in the rainforest and there isn’t an ideal spot to set up camp, it’s also prohibited. She starts saying she thinks she’s hypothermic. I realize that she is sweating underneath her jacket and tell her to change into a dry shirt so she’s not chilled underneath. She doesn’t like my solution and insists on letting her damp shirt air dry on her body with her jacket off because she didn’t pack a lot of clothes. I ask if she needs a medivac or to set up camp right where we were and she declines both. I try to push her through the breaks that she keeps wanting to take (I don’t know if this was right or not) but she’s getting increasingly upset about it getting dark and cold and the only solution I can think of is getting to camp as soon as possible. I give her my dinner since it was just bars while her food had to be cooked because she keeps saying she’s starving and I think some calories will help her. We finally make it to camp in the pitch black, I had to pull both of us and our packs across the trolley car because she is too tired. I’m on a tight schedule because I’m starting a new job when I get back to town and I have someone watching my dogs so I can’t really comfortably extend the time I’m on trail and I am now concerned about what I’ve gotten myself into.

The next morning I wake up to hearing her talking to a few other backpackers. They are stressing to her that taking breaks and time to eat lunch is essential and that we did the hardest 10 miles of the trail that nobody does in one single day. There is a guy that everyone is fan-girling over calling the mayor of the trail. He asks her about me and she says I am still in my tent. When I get out of my tent and pack up he seemed to make a point to speak to everyone but me, he just glared at me and left. This may have not been at purpose at all, I can admit I already felt like my teammate may have been making things out like I was the bad guy even though she decided to do 10 miles a day.

Day 2 she starts off by saying we may just have to buy new return flights and extend our time there. I can’t afford dishing out another $600 when I’ve already spent well over 1k on gear, tickets, permits etc. her fiancé makes a lot of money and paid for the majority of her trip but I am on a single income and supporting me and my four dogs. I can’t help but feel some resentment. I feel like I put in the work to train, put in all of this money and it’s not fair to expect me to dish out more money because she refused to practice especially when she picked the time frame. The situation is awkward but there’s a halfway point on the trail and I decide that if this gets bad enough I can tell her we can split or I can get her to the half way mark so she can get off.  She is making the worst faces and sounds possible. I only had one pair of dry socks that she wants to use because both her pairs are wet, but other than my spare mine are all wet as well. She refuses to climb any ladders carrying her hiking poles, refuses to read the map but is constantly asking me how many more kilometers, is even asking me frequently to pull her shirt down in the back. She made her own meals and all of her food must be jet boiled for a long time but there are no open flames allowed in the forest. She is asking for breaks on average probably every five minutes, complaining that she doesn’t want to get to camp late like we did last night, walking the speed of a glacier and upset because she is hungry. I don’t know what to do I am trying my best, Reddit. I was cheated on not that long ago and was left feeling like I had no value. I was thinking this was going to be my trip to remember I am strong and capable. I put so much into it, I’m in this gorgeous place so far from home and I feel like I can’t enjoy my time. She is in pain and at the briefing we were told if someone in the group gets rescued another person has to accompany them which would immediately end my trip. I start to worry if she injures herself because she isn’t prepared, how able am I to carry both of our loads?  She refused to pack lightly and her pack is 55lbs, mine is 35lbs and I weigh 110lbs. She is pushing herself to do something above her skill and I feel like it’s asking for an injury. I’m worried this girl is now jeopardizing my own safety because she is unprepared. I decide I need to tell my teammate it’s not working out.

I break down and tell her. There is a dad that trailed us the first day and the three of us got along. He was planning on doing the trip in 10 days and was more her pace. I offer to either get her halfway so she can get off the trail or set her up so she can stay an extra day at camp and meet up with him. I offer to give her some of my meals which would leave me with nothing extra but I felt like it was some sort of olive branch. I don’t want her to have a horrible time and she really wants to finish so maybe finishing with this guy is a good compromise. She starts sobbing saying she didn’t realize she was holding me back and then agrees to text the other backpacker.

We get to camp and meet the hikers we saw in the morning. She talks to them and I can feel the glares in my direction. They decide to empower her and tell her that she can do it in the time constraint on the plan that they are doing, though they don’t offer for her to hike with them. They tell her we already did the most difficult part and the rest is easier (Tbf this is true).  She decides she staying on the trail “with the group” which translates into hiking with me and ending up at the same camp as everyone. I timed it, I am walking on average for 3 minutes before she screeches telling me to wait and takes another three minutes to catch up.

I decide to make the most of this and try to be friends with the hikers. They start making some side remarks and I can tell everyone has this narrative that I’m the girl who tried ditching her friend instead of telling her she could do it. She goes on to tell them all around the campfire that she is getting married when she gets back home. The hikers ask what she’s doing about her bachelorette party and she shrugs and says jokingly “I guess this is it”. Me and this girl are acquaintances but to this group of hikers I am now the girl her tried to ditch a bride to be during her bachelorette trip. The amount of shit side remarks from these backpackers after that made me pretty miserable and I felt like a couple of them went out of their way to get justice for my teammate. Little things like cheering for her and dead silence for me, there were so many of these instances to make me feel like the odd one out. I could have taken them aside to explain but I just came to the conclusion that these people had already judged me so they weren’t really the kind of people I wanted as friends anyways. I can’t say it didn’t bother me at all but I tried my best to remind myself to keep my head high and get through it.

Day 3 I had to carry both of our packs for a section and other hikers had to help her climb over rocks. On last stretch of the trail I got the pleasure of hearing her for an hour repeat affirmations to herself aloud “I am a queen I am everything”. On the van ride back the other hikers were saying they knew this whole time she could do it and she would have gotten caught in rain if she waited for the hiker behind us. Perhaps I am butthurt from being an idiot but if felt like a jab at me really.   Turns out, she never has solo adventured she just makes her social media look like it. She finished the trail hobbling. On the way back we split a cab and she asked the driver to stop at Walmart so she could get something for shin splits. She took her time and returned with a bunch of dry clothes that she bought for herself. All my things were soaked through. She missed days of work after getting back and told me she would have to hobble to the alter.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I backpack I am rarely able to sleep.

I'm autistic, and I always sleep with my hands and feet tightly wrapped in my blanket. When I'm in a sleeping bag, I can't wrap my hands and feet and I end up tossing and turning all night. I usually end up wrapping my hands in a jacket or shirt but it only sort of works. 

I've researched sleeping quilts, but they are designed to use less fabric and connect to the sleeping pad, which doesn't solve my problem

I live in Alaska. I need something as warm and light as possible. My thought was to put some type of ultralight blanket INSIDE a sleeping bag liner, so I can twist myself up in the blanket like my autistic ass needs, but still have the liner that gives me the enclosed protection.

I'll be visiting Japan for three weeks around May/June. I'm planning to visit the major cities, but also wanted to incorporate a couple of places that are a bit more off the beaten path.

I'm not sure exactly how to phrase this question, but what places might you recommend where you can wholeheartedly experience the folklore and traditions of the country? I love forests and green areas and have read about its spiritual connotations (such as in Kafka on the Shore), so any recommendations for good walking/hiking trails would also be great!

Also on a side note, I am planning to do this trip at the end of a big backpacking route in SE Asia. I was thinking about buying a JR rail pass, but do I have to get it delivered to my house or do they offer online passes that I can buy whilst backpacking?

Just looking for advice on where to visit in India over the course of March-May.

Ideally, I was going to start in South India (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Hampi) up to Rajasthan &amp; Punjab via Goa, Gokarna &amp; finally the northern Himalaya region (Himachal Pradesh, Rishikesh, Leh).
But I’ve read conflicting reports on the weather in Rajasthan in April, some things I’ve read say it sits at about 32c &amp; some say it gets up to 48c. I think I’d rather spend more time somewhere cooler &amp; go back at a different time of year if it is true it gets up to 40c+.

Another thing is I’d very much like to be in a good spot for Holi &amp; I understand that it’s primarily a Northern Indian celebration.

Would it be feasible to do Rajasthan etc. in March then South India around April then travel back up to Amritsar region?

I’ll also be going to Varanasi at some point, not sure when though.

backpacking,"Hey Guys,
I often have feet problems when I hike in normal hiking boots. With a wider toe box I don't have such problems. Currently I'm hiking with Merrell Vapor Glove Luna barefoot shoes. But on longer hikes with spiky stones I wish to have a bit more of a sole. 
I heard a lot about the Altra. But what I don't like is that they wear out so quickly. The price is reasonable, but not if you have to buy every season another pair. 
Joe Nimble is more or less the same. Bought a pair, the sole was nearly gone after a few months. I got a new pair by service and the same thing started. Nearly 200€ for a pair of shoes which only last for a few months at best is just to high.
Can somebody recommend any other brand with a wide toe box and preferably zero drop, which has thicker soles than barefoot style shoes?

For example a hostel I could book here next week is $15 and then for any dates in May it jumps to $47. And that’s the case for all the ones I checked. That said, I’m wondering if prices drop as you get closer to the date? Like maybe it’s so expensive because it’s RSVPing months ahead?

I know prices go up in the summer, but I booked hostels last summer (in the midst of tourist season and in tourist traps like Paris) and they were more affordable than what I’m finding for May in Rome, Milan, and Amsterdam.

I know I should minimize this behavior but it's very tough. In order to better secure my phone so that it isn't ripped out of my hand (or even out of my pocket), I've thought about some sort of tether. I'm curious what other people have done (if anything). 

* I could use a long lanyard and attach my phone to my belt, but then I'll have quite a length of cord sticking out when I put my phone in my pants pocket. 
* Alternatively I could use the lanyard around my neck. I'm against leaving the phone hanging, though, and getting a lanyard long enough to reach to my pants pocket is hard, besides which I would have this whole long cord…

We are planning on doing both the Upper and Lower canyons over 3 days, splitting into two groups of 12 (as per backcountry regulations) and alternating hikes.

2. Is the road to the trailheads accessible by normal 2WD cars?

backpacking,"Several years ago, when I lived in Colorado, a group of friends were over and we were playing some tunes. It was late, but someone thought it would be a good idea to get up early the next morning and summit Uncompaghre, Colorado's sixth highest peak, nestled within Colorado's Uncompaghre Wilderness. I was still relatively new to Colorado, and had always wanted to climb one of the coveted ""14ers"", so I immediately committed myself.   


The next morning, everyone that was at my place the night before were now standing in my dark parking lot. My musician buddies thought it would be neat to bring their instruments to the top. The route is an 8 mile loop that climbs around 3000 feet, so they just gave me a sad smile. You see, I'm a musician - an upright bassist- and everyone knew I wasn't carrying a bulky, 50 lb or more instrument to the top of a mountain!   


I  told them I was game and so was ""Space Bass"".  It was a joke. We all laughed when I threw it into the back of the pickup. We all laughed when I hauled it out of the truck onto the trail, and we all laughed about halfway through the trip when the steep peak came into view.I planned to ditch the bass somewhere on the trail and pick it up on the way down, but I thought,""Hell, why not give it a shot?""

 Well, we gave it a shot and we made it. There was a little sketch spot, but most of it was just one step at a time. When we got to the top, we played some tunes, had some cool pictures with our celebratory summit beer, and then began our hike back down the mountain. This spontaneous, one off, non-planned adventure was one of the most definitive moments of my adult life. This trip sparked a huge love-affair with the mountains. Over the next few years I backpacked and climbed mountains almost every weekend, even in the winter. I just ran across some of the photos and thought I would share!","Basspacking to the summit of Uncompaghre's 14,321 foot summit",,Skillet007,,0,1/29/2023 20:21

backpacking,"30M in California here and my work is thankfully putting us back to remote work this May/June after being in office the past year. We were originally remote and for 6 months last year (September-March) I traveled across the country staying in airbnb rooms week to week. I literally stayed in a 25 airbnbs total, 1 a week at a time from Montana to South Carolina just exploring and doing some overnight camping on the weekends and driving my way across the country a little bit at a time. I work 7am-4pm PST and my goal was to keep my routine the same as back home as I feel great when I have that. I worked from my airbnb room desk during the day, meal prepped with an airfryer, ate out some for lunch at amazing bbq places, went to gym after work, and hiked or tent camped on the weekends. I stayed in a lot of cities but was able to stay in some unbelievable remote mountain airbnbs which I loved because it was so relaxing and most of them were still 30-45 minutes from a city so I could still keep my routine of working, cooking, gym, etc.

But that got extremely tiring and expensive so this time id love to do it different. I was paying on average $45-$65 a night on airbnbs and with small weekly discounts I was paying about $1500-1700 a month. Those were just for single rooms and not to mention the effort of trying to plan where I would stay next. I make $70K a year so trying to keep it under $1000 a month if possible. I dont care about staying in big cities as thats not what interests me.

I love backpacking, hiking, camping, waking up to beautiful places, so i'd love to spend this summer in Colorado, Washington, Montana, Utah, Wyoming or so. I figure I have a couple options

1. Get a room/place as a ""home base"" 1 month at a time. Use craigslist, facebook marketplace, [booking.com](https://booking.com/), or even airbnb monthly discounts to find a place under $1000 and essentially do what I did last time, but instead of changing places week to week I would only have to do it month to month
2. Screw it and try to camp it for the summer. I am wondering if this is doable as there are a few obstacles. First is obviously internet. I do 1-2 zoom meetings per day and need internet throughout the work day. I have a hotspot on my phone so I figure if I can find some dispersed camping where there is full Verizon coverage, I should be good? Next is just the logistics of working from my car/campsite. I have and can sleep in my car, I have a foldable mattress so that not a problem. But I don't have a problem setting up my tent as well. I figure I would just put up my camping chair (maybe get a small foldable table) and work from outside. And I can always get a hotel or airbnb room for a night if I get tired of it.
3. Coworking space during day or Cafe in mountain town. Then going to camp nearby after work and back the next morning.

Regarding camping, one idea I had was camping in free public lands (using the ioverlander app) or cheap campgrounds and being near a city so I have a better chance at having internet. I even have this idea of camping but still having a solid routine but Im not sure if is possible. So lets say I find a campsite with coverage in a dispersed camping area a few miles outside of Breckenridge. I make that my ""place"" for a week and sleep and do some work there. But I still have the ability to go to town after work to hit the gym (where I can shower), go to the grocery store to pick up some food, even go out to eat, and then head back to camp. And maybe even being able to work from a cafe or coworking space (not sure if these are solid?)

For example I heard of seasonal workers in Crested Butte, Colorado who were almost forced to do this. They were priced out of their apartments so they had to camp near town and then go to work in the morning.

On one hand I don't think every pound matters but I also think that if my pack was 5 pounds lighter, my body would thank me for it. Some basic numbers for my existing base weight:
Osprey Athaer 85 backpack, 2.27kg (5 lbs) 
MEC down sleeping bag - 9C (14 F), 1.45 kg (3.2lbs)
Big Agnes Copper Spur 2P tent, 1.8 kg (4lbs)
Thermarest neoair pad
Gigapower manual stove
Gsr soloist cookset
All of the above in the pack has a weight of 6.2 kg (13.7 lbs). 

I think I've only ever been too warm with this sleeping bag once. I also usually carry headlamp, stripen uv water purifier, hydration bag, Arcteryx Atom insulated jacket (345 g), rain jacket, small camera, basic clothing and dehydrated food/nuts/oatmeal.

Im also seriously considering carrying a camp chair (Helios) and getting a lightweight pillow. I weigh about 66kg and usually hike in the PNW and rockies/Purcells in BC.

backpacking,"I am 18F and still at school but have applied for a deferred entry to university. 

My original plan was to solo travel as a female to loads of different countries from South America, Africa to SEA. Then I realized this wasn't possible because it would be way too intense for a first time solo traveler and as it is starting to come up to my gap year, I have more and more reserves about solo traveling as a female at this age as most people go with at least a friend. 

That is why not I have decided to apply for jobs as a GAP Student in the UK (where I live) and that was I can travel during school holidays or when my contract ends. I feel like this role would be really fun and hopefully allow me to meet like-minded gap students who would want to travel together.

However, I am now not sure if my traveling can fit into my year with that job. Some schools demand a full academic year whilst others demand a term. It would be ideal if I could find a Gap Student placement in South Africa or SEA but I can't seem to find any and am not sure if I am looking at the right places. My current plan is to backpack SEA (Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos (places ranked from most to least important)) between Jan - Feb/March but I am not sure if that is enough time to properly see each of these places. I am now coming up to my A levels (final exams) and the stress is starting to kick in because I have to start planning my gap year such as submitting job applications on top of schoolwork and it is just getting a bit too much. That is why I was thinking of joining a Group Tour, I was looking at the Ultimate Gap Year by Gap360 which seems alright, if anyone has had any experience with them please let me know, But I am just worried about not having enough freedom to do things I want to do and picking my own hostels, meeting new people at each place etc. 

TLDR:

I've got too many things I want to do during my gap year such as:

- Work as a GAP Student (UK (where I live), Australia, SEA, South Africa (ideal but can't find any positions))
- Backpack SEA
- Volunteer + Visit Africa next summer (teaching, wildlife, medical, can't decide)
- Learn to Surf in a Surf Camp (Bali/Spain/Portugal)

Would it be possible to do them all whilst working as a Gap Student at school during term time? 

How should I go about looking for Gap Student job vacancies in other countries?  I have looked at different country's association websites and unable to find any and Letz Live which looks great but they require me to pay now as applications are due and my mind isn't set yet.

If you were 18F and finding it hard to plan your gap year, would you sacrifice the extra freedom of solo traveling to go on a group tour? 

Should I go on a group tour if I am a first time solo female 18yo traveler? 

Solo Travel Pros:
- Freedom to do what I want
- Something I've wanted to do for a while 
- Able to control my living situation and people I am around because I can choose hostels and meet different people

Solo Travel Cons:
- I am getting really stressed about planning it 
- What if I hate it, can't make friends and feel really lonely? 
- What if it is too much for me because of my inexperience?

Group Travel Pros:
- No need to plan as much 
- Guaranteed to meet people
- Could be really fun and less stressful as everything is already sorted 

Group Travel Cons:
- Less freedom
- I can't pick and choose my own hostels (I want to stay at party hostels and meet people) 
- There are too many options out there!!

Another option for something I can do is go on a group tour to volunteer in one country or visit a couple and then from there, I gain some experience of solo traveling and can see if I am up for actually doing it on my own or even meeting someone on the tour to do with

Are there any group tours company you would recommend? I am currently looking at PMGY, Gap360 and Gadventures for traveling and the Mighty Roar for volunteer experiences. 

Sorry about the blurb if you can't tell I'm really stressing and am prone to overthinking up until the point where i'm just like ""sod it"" and do whatever but I just don't want to waste this year as a Gap Year is something I've wanted to for a long time especially backpacking but I am also worried about it being not as great as people make it out to be and also whether I would make friends or have a good experience as a Chinese british female traveler.

I love meeting and talking to new people, partying and just doing spontaneous things, I don't like being tied down but at the same time I need a sense of security of having at least someone there with me. 

P.S. one final really weird question:

I hope this letter finds you well, because I sure as heck am not. Can we talk about something that's been bugging me lately? (No pun intended, because if you're one of the culprits, then you know bugs are the least of my concerns.)

First of all, can we discuss the whole headphone thing? I get it, you want to jam out to your music, but can you please do it through your headphones? I don't want to hear your terrible taste in music (or podcasts, or audiobooks, or whatever else you're listening to) blaring through the walls at all hours of the night. I mean, I know I'm not the only one who's trying to sleep here.

And speaking of sleep, can we please keep the noise level to a minimum after hours? I know it's hard to contain your excitement about being on vacation, but some of us have to wake up early for, you know, actual vacation activities. And while we're on the subject, can we please stop turning on the main light in the middle of the night? It's like a beacon calling out to the hungover, sleepy ghosts of hostels past.

And let's talk about cleanliness, shall we? I'm all for having a good time, but when you're puking inside the room and leaving it there for the rest of us to deal with, that's just not cool. And finally, let's talk about snoring. I don't know what you guys are eating, but whatever it is, please stop it. Some of us are trying to sleep here, and your chainsaw impersonations are not helping.

All in all, I'm just asking for a little bit of consideration for your fellow hostel dwellers. We're all in this together, and let's make sure we're all getting the most out of our vacation.

backpacking,"I literally just got back from REI, and I tried on every backpack in the store, and literally the only one that fit me was the Talon 44 L/XL. I am 6'1"" 172 pounds. I nearly pulled the trigger and just bought it, but I decided to wait until I got home to do some research.

I intend to use this backpack as my gym bag, and just an every day type of bag to get stuff around.  Up until this point getting my shit back and forth to the gym has been so painful. I cannot have my regular backpack on my back at all, so what I always do is hold it in my right hand only (left doesn't work for some reason), and I have to set it down every half block. 

My brother let me try on his backpacking backpack, and I was in awe at the fact that even though it was quite packed I couldn't feel it in my back because most of the weight was on my hips. 

So I realized I need a backpacking type backpack with hip straps for every day use, it is my only option due to my condition. I would love to use it for hiking as well, but up until this point in my life I have always assumed I could never hike with a bag because my back was too bad. But we'll see. 

Anyway, I really liked the 44 and it honestly seemed about the size of my current gym bag and I think it would fit everything and maybe even be a tight fit because my shower towel is quite thick and takes up a lot of space lol. And I bring a change of clothes and my swimsuit and my shower stuff and protein shaker and goggles. But ya I guess I only thought it might be tight because the 44 is very narrow, like it is skinny and long, which I like, it fit so well.

However, once I got home I realized there is a Talon 22, which actually looks like a regular backpack. I was considering that, but unfortunately REI didn't have one to try on so I am left wondering if they fit the exact same as each other or not.

I am not sure if I would be willing to spend $160 on a small backpack. I rather like the fact that the 44 can be used for so many different things, it feels like I could use it around the city and for hiking, and the gym. I feel like the 22 is only for the city. 

And I'm also not sure if the 22 would fit my stuff because I can't see it in person because the REI didn't have it. 

Also, would you guys buy your backpack at REI or would you buy it at amazon or something? The REI return policy and lifetime warranty did seem appealing. But you tell me, I'm new to this world, what do you guys do? 

I guess I'm just afraid people will look at me like I'm a weirdo for carrying the Talon 44 around the city since it looks like an actual backpacking backpack. I feel like I'd blend in with the 22 more, but honestly I really do like the 44 and feel like it is a great size. 

But ya I really don't know, I would like to take whichever bag I choose on a plane possibly, would they allow the 22 but not the 44? 

But ya the main question I have is whether or not the 22 and the 44 fit the exact same. 

I'd love your advice, thanks! And if you have any other advice for someone trying to reduce backpain, I'd love to hear it! thanks pals &lt;3","I have scoliosis and neck issues and I want to start using a backpacking bag for my every day bag, and to go to the gym.

backpacking,"Hey everyone! Just looking for a little advice for an upcoming trip. I'm going to be backpacking through Asia for around 4-9 months. I've got my first 3-4 months roughly planned out due to visa restrictions in countries and freediving training I'll be doing which will take me from Indonesia to Phillipines to Borneo and down to Komodo. From there I'll be heading up through Malaysia and beyond. 

Now I haven't been backpacking for aaaages. My last trip was 6 months in Central America and I had a regular sized backpack(about 30L) and a huge 85L travel backpack full. Thing is I ended up just carting around most of the clothing without ever touching it. I wasn't efficient with anything and just lumped it in. I found having the massive bag a huge inconvenience too. It wasn't so bad because I wasn't flying around so no having to check the luggage everytime etc. But in Asia I will be taking a lot of flights. 

I have a mirrorless camera with 3 lenses(only one zoom and the other two are tiny and light), a laptop, GoPro and then from there it's just clothes and essentials that I'll need. 

My question is, am I nuts in thinking a 45L could possibly be enough to hold all my stuff that I need? I think the bulk of my big bag last time was just unnecessary clothes. I ended up just buying singlets etc. And re-wearing the same thing over and over again anyways. Anyone have experience travelling on a big trip light like this? I'm out of practice so are there any logistics I'm not considering?? I mean if this bag gets stolen I'm pretty cooked, but that'll be the case regardless as my smaller bag likely would contain my valuables anyways. 

I'm looking at the Wandrd Prvke 41L or the Peak Design 45L travel backpack. Unfortunately not able to find in stores near me I don't think so I can't see in person but can buy/return. 

Aaaaany advice or just plain telling me that's a dumb idea is much appreciated!",Southeast Asia for 4+ months. 45L enough??,,SnooDonuts2308,,0,1/25/2023 21:58

I'm torn if I should give up my rented apartment and become a full time digital nomad for a year, the pros are that the funds I pay for rent can be used to fund travel, the cons are that if I decide to go home early I'd need to find a new place to live.

To those who bit the bullet and completely left to be a full time digital nomad with no bills or ties to home

What was the deciding factor that made you give it all up?

Certain people in this group are excited about the ""girls and partying"" aspect of Cartagena, but I'm not interested. Personally, more interested in nature/activities.

backpacking,"So I got a bivy bag. I've always used tents before, never tried a tarp or hammock, but decided to branch out since I'm interested in trying some winter hiking and was hoping the bivy could give a boost to my 30 degree bag. I'm a big believer in trying out new any equipment close to home, so I went out to do a bit of stealth camping for the night in a nearby bit of woods. 

Conditions were terrible, 30-33 degrees F, and raining with maybe 6 inches of snow cover. Pretty miserable, but not out of the ordinary for my area. I knew it was going to be a pretty rough test sleeping out in the bivy with no tarp overhead, and I'd read about condensation and all the cons that come along with bivy sacks. 

Getting in and getting set up was really quick and easy, and I even managed to stay fairly dry and keep my sleeping bag dry. But with heavier precipitation, or more wind I could see how that might not be possible depending on conditions.

The first few hours I was pretty toasty and comfortable. Before I fell asleep I did a pretty good job minimizing condensation buildup by keeping a small opening in the zipper and breathing directly through that. Once I fell asleep though, I wasn't able to keep that up. By 5:30am the condensation buildup was pretty bad, and my down bag had lost a lot of loft, especially around my shoulders. Luckily I was still dry inside, but it was getting chilly.

That's when I called it quits and went home. If I'd been out somewhere where I wasn't able to bail I'd have had to get up, pack all my wet gear, and just hang out till the sun came up trying not to freeze, and if I'd had a second night out planned, I'd have to scratch that as I'd have no good way of drying my sleeping gear out.

Lessons learned:

\- Bivys are appealing for the weight and minimal packed space, but using one takes practice (to be fair, using a tent in adverse conditions takes some practice, too).

\- Bivys really do benefit from a tarp, which would have allowed me to keep the top of the bivy open and avoided all the condensation buildup from my breath.

\- If conditions really suck, and you have no tarp, you'll need to close the bivy up pretty much all the way, and you might not be able to stay out for multiple nights due to all the moisture you're trapping. 

Any body else have tips on staying dry in a bivy and how to beat the catch-22 of closing up to stay dry, only to get wet anyway from condensation buildup?",First night in a bivy - got wet and cold,,ChoppinNE,,0,1/23/2023 12:10

Apologies if formatting is wrong, I’m on mobile and don’t often post. 

I’m currently in Western Australia, not sure if this is the best place to post this question but if anyone has any other subreddit suggestions please let me know!

So basically, I’ve already completed my three month regional work in south west Australia with one employer, and I applied for (and was granted) my 2nd working holiday visa to stay another year. My question is: if I decided to do some more farm work while travelling within my first year, before my second year visa starts, would that potentially damage my visa grant?

The requirements for the regional work is either 3 months (if you stay with the same employer) or 88 individual days if you work for multiple employers, which ends up being over 4 months in total. 

If anyone has any insights into my conundrum, I’d love some feedback!",Can doing farm work after 2nd year visa is granted affect the visa?,,phauksie,,0,1/23/2023 11:48

backpacking,"\#郭文貴 #GuoWenGui  It is understandable to say that the two parties in the United States are fighting fiercely. The new Speaker of the US House of Representatives, McCarthy, announced his visit to Taiwan as soon as he took office, and set up an anti-Chinese establishment to gain more support. What is the purpose of Guo Wengui's hard work? Hearing that McCarthy was going to visit Taiwan, Guo Wengui became excited, and he spoke clearly and logically in the live broadcast, as if he had both the United States and China under his control. His expression and posture really made people laugh. To say that he is an excellent comedian, I would have no doubts.

Then again, Guo Wengui's desire to perform has long been uncontrollable. Since 2018, he has produced a program ""Guo Wengui Watching the Spring Festival Gala"", and he will perform impromptu performances every year. Just a casual look, the content of the ""revealing news"" in the program is very similar to the lines and scripts, he reads the script from time to time, if he forgets what to say in the next sentence, he starts to make up random words, one after another obscene words, underage Not suitable for everyone to watch. He worked very hard, and held it every year for 4 years. The cold rice from 4 years ago was fried again and again, and it became a ""new revelation"" after adding oil and vinegar.

Last month, he announced that his father passed away and retreated for three weeks. He did it, but few people knew what he was doing during these three weeks. In the first episode after his ""comeback"", he talked eloquently, with a happy face, and his beard could not stop his ""excitement"". Could it be that he has been preparing for the 2023 ""Spring Festival Gala"" performance for the past three weeks?

As we all know, Guo Wengui is an internationally wanted criminal. He could have found a hidden place to hide, but chose to expose himself on social platforms. From this aspect, it shows that his background is quite ""hard"". You know, the United States likes people like Guo Wengui. People, even if the person is full of lies and nonsense, they still welcome it. But Guo Wengui is smarter than ""these people"". He firmly seized the opportunity to curry favor with the upper echelons of the United States, and acted as a dog licker at critical moments so that he could gain a firm foothold in the United States. Bannon, Trump's former adviser, was undoubtedly picked up by him. Now Guo Wengui is playing McCarthy's idea again, talking about McCarthy, but are Americans so stupid?

backpacking,"I live in Colorado and I enjoy winter camping. I would like to try some winter backpacking, but only have a 0 degree down bag, which is pretty warm down to low 20s as I am a warm sleeper. 

The problem is I don’t have too much money to buy a negative degree bag especially since I spent $300 on my 0 degree bag, but I occasionally use a thin sleeping bag liner with my current bag which adds a bit of warmth. 

I use the Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme sleeping bag liner and I know it says it adds 25F I know that is not true. 

But my main question would be, if I bought the fleece liner by Sea to Summit which says adds 32F (again I know it’s not that much) and combined it with my current Extreme liner, would you think that would add enough warmth to get into single digits? That would only add an extra 1lbs and some change if I purchased the fleece liner and it’s only $99, as opposed to if I just purchased a $600 negative temp sleeping bag. 

Also, I know what some people may say, I know to pair it with a good R Value pad!

backpacking,"TL,DR: I'm 27M, taking a career break and looking to backpack for 4-5 months from mid-Feb and I'm trying to decide between SE Asia and South America.  Any tips / advice / random thoughts welcome!?  Especially relating to the current situation in the region's and whether it's the right time to go, e.g. Peru.

--

Bit of background: I'm 27 and worked in finance since I left uni.  I wasn't able to afford to take a gap year / long term travel when I was younger (did a couple of months here / there and spent time with family living abroad) but I recently quit my job and I want to take advantage of the career break to do some solo backpacking.  

I'm not minted but not on a shoestring so have reasonable budget flexibility, am active, confident traveller (have always travelled - Cambodia / Borneo) and looking for a mixture of culture / nature / hiking / some partying.  I'm going to leave mid-Feb (save paying rent!!) but can't decide whether to go to South America or India+South East Asia...??  I always wanted to travel to both regions (I'll do both eventually) so I've got detailed plans for both that work with the relevant seasons.

In terms of thoughts...

SE Asia:
 - Pros: Amazing places to travel; great food; more land travel options (prefer to travel through rather than fly where possible - love a long train); likely easier to social given the number of backpackers
 - Cons: I've visited a few places previously (Bangkok/Chiang Mai, Siem Reap, Borneo); I'm worried the crowd will a lot younger and focussed more on partying and budget travel
 - Political situation: Myanmar and Sri Lanka probably the only whole countries to avoid

South America:
 - Pros: More amazing nature / scenery - generally appeals more; a completely new culture that I've never visited before
 - Cons: Less of a backpacker culture, so might be harder to socialise; food is less reliable across the continent although fantastic in certain places
- Political situation: Bit worried that I might be effected by the current turmoil - Peru is a big part of my trip and it looks impossible at the moment, as well as Brazil and quite a few other areas

backpacking,"Hello
I am F28 and I’ve been depressed for some time. It hasn’t been easy and I feel this fucking disease took precious years in this planet away from me.
As a plus, my parents weren’t the best teaching me how to be brave or even sociable. They are closed persons, without friends and afraid of life. I tried to escape that, but I didn’t succeeded 100%.

I wanna do something. I need to do something. I am slowly rotting.
Could you give me suggestions? Please?

What are fun and crazy festivals, parties, parades or orgies around the world? lol I’ve heard of La Tomatina and Holi.

What’s something thrilling and exciting?

Where is an amazing place to learn cool stuff, like sailing or fixing cars, chopping wood, milking cows, surfing etc? I feel the need to use my body. I wanna learn stuff. I’ve heard of a project called earthship global, where you build sustainable houses. I need to research it more, but it sounds interesting (as long as it isn’t an white savior situation).

Any tips of trails?
Of course, I know the PCT. That’s a hard one, right? :( I wanted something long and beautiful. The idea of walking and being alone seems strangely exciting.
But, the thing is, I’ve never camped before. I am not in great shape. I would get my ass kicked even in a tiny and easy trail. 
My dread is to climb the Kilimanjaro. I’ve watched too much The lion king when I was a kid lol They say it isn’t a technical climb, but I am pretty sure I would fail, tho… Like I said, I’m not in a great shape.

Please?
Suggestions?

Anything that seems like loads of fun, quirky, weird places, gardens with erotics sculptures, water (i wanna take my PADI certification so badly so I can scuba dive alone!), somewhere I can learn stuff, real adventure, abandoned constructions…

And that’s it.

Please, help me with some ideas.

My plan was to go backpacking through Mexico and south America with only a 40 liters backpack, but unfortunately I didn't think through it and didn't realize that I would also need space for the warm clothes that I was wearing on the flight to Mexico and things I will need to buy here.

So I have some things here with me that I don't really need:

- Second Jumper
- too many tshirts
- too many adapters
- A book I will probably never read
- maybe a jacket that is not waterproof and will have to be replaced here at some point 

I was thinking about sending this to either Germany or England where I have people who can receive it.

What is the cheapest way to send things home? It doesn't matter how long it takes, it just has to be as cheap as possible. If it takes half a year, no problem all.

backpacking,"I am thinking about backpacking somewhere in East Africa for three weeks in late April/early May and have been looking at Uganda and Rwanda. I've been to Ghana, Sierra Leone and Namibia and found it easy and enjoyable to get around Ghana with a backpack, but I used to live there back then, which obviously made it quite easy as I was quite familiar with the place.

As a uni student I am looking to travel on a budget using mostly public transport (matatus) and hostels/cheaper guest houses, and I was wondering how easy that would be in Uganda and Rwanda?

Also, what things would you suggest I check out? I am not looking for mountain gorillas or going on safari (did plenty of that in Namibia), and would like to focus more on cultural aspects, exploring local areas on foot, and more accessible nature that doesn't require shelling out on pricey guides.

My rough thinking so far is to take a route that starts in Kampala, then heads east to the Twenzori Mountains (checking out Entebbe and Sipi Falls on the way), then turning south towards Rwanda, passing the Lake Katwe salt pans, and continuing to Kigali, then Lake Kivu.

The one thing I thought about splurging on may be hopping over into the DRC and climbing Nyirangongo, because the lava lake has been on my bucket list for the better part of a decade by now.

Because I added places, it's obviously still a pretty busy trip. My biggest dilemma right now is whether I should remove Munich and Salzburg or not ? 

I really wanted to do those cities because Munich is more stereotypical German cute city (while Berlin, which I'm still super interested in, is not) and Salzburg is just so beautiful looking. I'd also like to visit Eagles Nest while I'm in that area. But I realize it's a pretty big detour from the rest of the itinerary for only a very short visit. Is it worth it or would I be better off removing them and adding those nights to my other destinations? Any ideas how I can move things around without removing destinations?

backpacking,"**I would love thoughts on my heavier gear choices.**

I am a big guy, 275 lbs. and 6' tall, and I will be backpacking with my two boys. I am in remission from a very bad fight with oral cancer that has left me with some physical needs I did not have before. This is compounded by osteoarthritis in one knee. Despite all of this, I have no physical activity restrictions, I hit the gym 3-5 days each week for weight lifting and cardio, and my doctors see no reason I cannot backpack. **My needs include:**

* I must use a water bladder when hiking, not a water bottle. I need to take tiny sips every few minutes because I make very little saliva. I cannot afford to run out of water on the trail, even for an hour.
* My body is healing and will be for years, so I need more comfort than most backpackers. A good night's sleep and an elevated place to sit are necessities, not luxuries if I am hiking.
* I cannot guarantee that I can throw the line for a bear bag.

My boys are 7 and 10. They already enjoy car camping and hiking with me. We will start with an overnight trip or two this spring and then move to weekends or longer during the summer. I will have to carry all of our group gear including food because their personal items will likely max out their carrying capacity. Although they can do a 5-mile loop hike with a 1000' elevation gain, we will start with smaller backpacking trips until we know they (and my bad knee) can handle more with the extra weight.

**Here is my current plan for big items for me and the group gear:**

* Tent - Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL4 - 5 lb. 4 oz.
* Tent Footprint - Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL4 Footprint - 11 oz.
* Sleeping Pad - Big Agnes Q-Core Deluxe long, wide (25""x78"") - 2lb. 2 oz.
* Quilt - Enlightened Equipment Revelation Custom, regular length, extra-wide 10d nylon, 850 fill, 20 F rated - 1 lb. 11 oz.
* Backpack - Osprey Aether 65 - 5 lbs.
* Cooking System - Jetboil Sumo - 1 lb.
* Bear Canister - I have no idea
* Backpacking stool - I have no idea

There is a big weight jump between the Copper Spur UL3 and UL4 that I am not thrilled with, but a 3-person tent seems like a bad idea for a big dad and two growing boys. The boys are autistic, though you likely would not know it when meeting them, and thus they have sensory and emotional regulation needs. They are not yet ready to camp in hammocks or in a tight space.

I know that footprints are not strictly needed, but I anticipate having some distractions when we set up camp. I would rather we protect our expensive tent from my mistakes.

I could save weight on the sleeping pad by going with the Q-core SLX. I am not sure if the weight savings is worth the decreased R-value, though. A Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Xlite wide would save 1 lb. 3 oz., but I am a big guy and a side sleeper. From what I have read that pad might not give me as comfortable a night's rest.

I already ordered the custom Revelation quilt on Black Friday, so that is a done deal.

The Osprey Aether was strongly recommended to me based on how much gear I will need to carry for the family. I found it to be a very comfortable pack when I tried it on with weight.

I am looking at the Jetboil Sumo because it can cook for the three of us at once. I need a stove that can potentially do more than just boil water because my boys' sensory needs may limit what they can eat on the trail.

I do not know what would be a good choice for a bear canister and a backpacking chair. I could see using an Ursack over a canister. I could also see using a canister to double as my chair so long as I wait until just before bed to put it away from camp. We live and hike in black bear country.

My base weight is already at \~16 lbs. before I add in the bear canister, stool, and personal items. Then food for 3 and a generous water portion will increase it further.

If I cannot use an oral device to deal with my sleep apnea, I may need another 5 lbs. of equipment for a travel CPAP.

I'd be interested in doing something slightly smaller (i.e. no room for clothes; just the stuff I need during the day) that clips into a main pack where I could put a few nights' worth of clothes.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to include a sleeping bag and small tent in the main pack as well.

So! My passport has finally been approved and the last time I left the U.S. was half my life ago. Long story short is that my health isn't going to last me forever at this rate so I wanna get out there. Short story long is that about six years ago my mom had a tragically short bout with an aggressive unknown cancer, literally months before being the first in her family to ever retire, and had been holding off until then to start actually living her life. Put my own life on hold to process (I'd just gotten engaged months before this lol life, right?). Fast forward a bit and now four years ago, just as I was really getting back to seeing forward in life, had a job that paid well, no kids or responsibilities, etc. I decided this was it - time to get out and see the world!

That was fall 2019. Lol. So we paused again.

Now... two years ago, I was unexpectedly diagnosed with late onset T1 diabetes (blessing and a curse tbh because I've never felt healthier than I do now but it adds a whole slew of layers to travel plans). The biggest thing is that it made me *super* aware of my body's more limited shelf life, though. Gave myself time to get in habits and adjust to my new existence and then started looking forward again. Finally, earlier this year, I fainted alone in my home and while I managed to miss killing myself or suffering serious long term consequences by literally millimeters, it left me full of a deep seated WE GOTTA MAKE THE BEST OF THE TIME WE'VE GOT, KIDDO sentiment that has me itching to GO GO GO. The fainting was not from diabetes, btw- it was from standing up too quick lol doctor has given full OK for physical activity. 

So anyway... Help me make the right choice on where to start lol? I'm slowly building out my gear so at this point, not looking for anything too intense. Hoping to pack in, camp overnight/two nights, pack out. Solo and female (ish lol), fairly fit, and looking for vistas or history as the destination (could be open to a hostel stay but that's tbh scarier to me than the woods cause I can be hella awkward lol).

I've never traveled in my life and it's a huge regret. I want to do it so badly.

But  at this point I'm 34 and I feel like everyone at hostels is 21 or  similar. The idea of staying at a hostel and being the old guy makes me  feel so sad and depressed. I miss being 20 with the attitude that the  world is my oister. Now I just feel like a boring adult and I feel like  20 year olds will want nothing to do with me.

I  feel like I would be completely out of place. I traveled once and  stayed at several hostels, at 29. And everyone was pretty much early 20s  and I already felt really old. Now at 34 it would be much worse.

I  used to be extremely shy at 20 and only now feel confident to do the  things everyone else did at 20. But now I'm going to be the old guy.....

Does  anyone have experience with that? How can you connect, and enjoy  meeting other people without feeling ancient?

My friends and I often go on weeklong camping trips, driving by motorcycle from place to place.  Sometimes we do this together, sometimes we do this solo.   


Over the past year or so, I've started labeling places in my google maps so I don't forget them (""Great campsite,"" ""Hiking trail to cool overlook,"" etc.).  My friends all do the same.

Because my friends and I don't always travel together, I'm wondering if there's an app we could use to that would allow all share and mark various campsites, hiking trails, etc..

backpacking,"I would rate myself as an absolute trekking, mountaineering and nature enthusiast. My whole everyday life revolves around just one thought: ""How can I get back to the mountains quickly. I have now published 4 big tours on Instagram and there are a number of exciting projects in the pipeline .I carry all my tours with “Rupert”, a 25 kg backpack that accompanies me on all my tours. I am constantly out and about with a tent and also prefer to spend most or all of my nights in a tent. I would describe my way of moving as alpine trekking. I see only a few or none who move around in the Alpine region in a similar way to me. I also aim to spend as little money as possible-about 10 euros/day. I try to keep my ecological footprint close to zero and of course I try to use my feet 98% .I deliver pictures that very rarely anyone will see and extraordinary innovative stories that contain a high entertainment factor. I also believe that I am an innovative and creative person who always tries to break new ground, even if I definitely have ""staying power"". My tours cover the entire Alps. Currently I prefer the north of Italy for my tours. In the future, however, Switzerland, Slovenia and France will also be on the agenda.

Here my last projects:

Munich-Venice (approx. 500km):
on the legendary ""Traumpfad"". However, the passion quickly arose in me to create my own tours around official hiking trails. In general, it is important to me to migrate my own compositions and to have as much contact as possible to have with the mountains. I don't go the fastest route, but mostly the most demanding EE-Sentieros, and via ferrata if the situation allows. On this tour, for example, I climbed the Civetta, did the delle trincee via ferrata and made a complete Schiara crossing including all via ferratas .These are all the highlights that are not included in the official dream path.
Garda Trekk (approx. 150 km):
around the mountains of Lake Garda including a complete Monte Baldo crossing. Unfortunately, I injured myself on the tour so that my planned 14-day tour in Madeira could not take place.
Project: Back to the Roots (approx. 600 km)
Is a big project that should follow my Slovenian roots. The project is divided into several parts. I was able to do the first part in the summer, spending 40 days in the mountains with my tent. A personal and strong record that I'm proud of. It was an incredible adventure with many ups and some downs. I took the whole Brenta with me Crossed the national park including the mountains.
Como Trek (about 200 km)
About 6 weeks ago I came back from my last adventure, where I was able to discover part of the breathtaking mountains on Lake Como for myself. I crossed the whole Grigne Group and crossed the Dorsale del Triangolo Lariano high trail.

A very big project and linked to it are a lot of activities from my everyday life and also all future tours, the ascent of an 8000m peak or trekking tours in the Himalayas or Karakoram are also on the plan.

backpacking,"As I was studying in Denmark, I fell in love with the country and its culture. One day, over a beer with my friend Adam, we were discussing the best way to truly get to know Denmark. I have to admit, I was sceptical about what Denmark had to offer, as I came from a country with rich forests and mountains, and Denmark is known for being flat.

We decided that the best way to truly experience the country would be to cycle it, and what better time to do it than in the summer? Denmark is known for being bike-friendly, and we had both been using bikes to get around since we arrived. We thought that cycling would allow us to take in the scenery at a leisurely pace and discover hidden gems that might be missed by other means of transportation. So, we set out to bike over 570 km in 10 days, exploring the country from south to north, similar to backpacking but on bicycles.

We decided to use public shelters as our accommodation, as there are many of them throughout the country. We asked our Danish friend for recommendations on the most interesting places to visit, and made a map of our route. We narrowed down our choices and planned a trajectory that would take us from Flensburg on the west coast of Denmark, all the way to the northernmost point, Skagen. We recorded the entire experience to document it and make it available to others who are interested in exploring Denmark Thanks for supporting our little project!

**TLDR:** *Two friends, while studying in Denmark, decided to explore the country by cycling from south to north over a period of 10 days. They biked over 570km and used public shelters as accommodation. They recorded their journey and made it available for others to follow their adventure. The friends were initially sceptical about Denmark's charm, as it is known for being flat, but they eventually discovered its unique beauty.*

India seems to have a a more diverse range of hostel chains and booking sites. The one's i've identified are:

\- Youth Hostel Association of India hostels

\- Zostel

\- ones listed on Hostelworld

backpacking,"I'm looking at doing a 200 mile backpacking trip this summer with some friends. We're aiming to do about 15x 15 mile days with 4x 0 days. With that in mind, I want myself and my friends to be in shape to actually do this. We each come from athletic backgrounds, but I still want us all to prepare as much as possible. It would suck if one of us broke midway through. 

Obviously, the best way to train for backpacking is to actually backpack. Unfortunately, I don't think we each have enough time to practice 15 mile days frequently. On the weekends, sure. But not during the weekdays.

We'd probably each have about 1-2 hours to train/exercise M-F. With that in mind, what do you think would be most helpful? 

Running on a soft surface (grass, gravel, maybe treadmill?, etc.) seems like a necessary component of a good training program. Gradually increasing the mileage. However, not sure if running with weight (rucking) would be good since we'll be walking not running. Rucking might just f*** us up. 

Weight training seems like it might be worthwhile, but I'm not sure. If it is, I would assume high rep, low intensity, with a lot of control and attention to form would be best. But not sure. Maybe going heavy, if done with control and correct form, would be better. 

And then resistance training with bands seems worthwhile to me too. Clam shells, reverse clam shells, hip/glute bridges, leg lifts, etc.

Any other ideas? What's worked for you? What's worked for other people?

Is there a particular reason one should hike the route from North to South, or it does not really matter?

backpacking,"So my partner and I went on a three-hour hike through the Rose and Red valleys just outside of Goreme, Cappadocia today. It was overall an awesome experience; the rock structures were towering and surreal, the trail mostly empty because it's off-season, and we were just happy to be out in nature.

About halfway through the hike, my girlfriend was ahead of me climbing through a tunnel along the path when she gave a big shriek. My consequent alarm was short-lived when I clambered out and found my girlfriend baby talking with a sheepish, adolescent German shepherd.

As has happened a few times throughout our time in Turkey, this collar-less stray joined us for the next hour or so as we trudged up and down muddy escarpments and encountered all manner of beautiful vistas. It would run ahead a little and wait for us to catch up and chase what I think were field mice in the dry grass. It was relatively healthy looking and just very sweet and distantly affectionate.

However, things took a turn as we started heading back. As we were descending a particularly slippery part of the path, the dog grew visibly tense. Moments later, a group of four other strays - one of which was another shaggier German shepherd - came barreling out of the trees barking.

""Our"" stray immediately ran to me, pressed itself against my leg and growled at the oncoming dogs, who growled in return. The pack then attacked the dog by my leg, ganging up on and viciously biting it as it yelped. In the moment, I had no idea what to do. I raised my voice at the dogs but was ultimately most concerned about my partner or myself getting caught in the fray and bitten as well. We tried to get out of their way.

""Our"" stray eventually bolted and was chased for a good five minutes until it reached a cave where it was trapped by the others. We thought the best thing was to continue down the trail, as the pack seemed to want to walk with us. We hoped they would follow us and leave the poor and possibly injured dog alone - which they did. However, a little while it came back, seemingly looking for us, and was attacked and chased off again.

I don't know why the pack ganged up on the German shepherd - I'm sure there's a biological/behavioural explanation - and I know we shouldn't get attached to random animals that in no way belong to us.

But my partner and I feel quite upset by the whole encounter, and I feel very guilty because the dog came running to me when the pack attacked, either for protection or to protect me, and I couldn't really do anything to help. I keep wondering if there was more I could have done - like yell louder or maybe throw rocks - but I was also worried about getting myself or my partner hurt.

We don't know what happened to the dog but I really hope it's okay. Sorry for the long post, just trying to wrap my head around today!

Has anything like this happened to any of you? How did you cope? Do you think we were at risk of getting attacked ourselves?

TL;DR - A sweet stray that joined us on a hike today was viciously attacked by a pack of four other dogs in front of us. We feel guilty and upset for not having done more.",Somewhat traumatised by an encounter with stray dogs in the Cappadocian hills. How do we deal with this?,,daveyk95,,0,1/12/2023 19:54

backpacking,"I took a trip to big bend national park over winter break and backpacked the chisos. It was mind-blowingly gorgeous, and I had a wonderful time, excluding one small caveat. *Sleeping*, it was awful. I slept in the Backcountry, and knowing it was going to be cold, I haphazardly bought some gear. The first night I was cold (in the mid 30s) but not uncomfortably so, just enough for me to consider using my sleeping bag liner before passing out again. The second night however was agonizing. The temperatures were cooler than the first night by 10 degrees, yet my upper body was extremely uncomfortably hot to the point of sweating. To make matters worse my lower legs and feet were freezing cold. 

I did my best to prepare for the relatively cold temperatures but in all honesty I kinda cheaped out on everything other than shelter.

My sleep system consisted of a Rab ridge raider bivvy, a marmot nanowave 35° sleeping bag, and my old snugpak fleece liner and thermarest ridgerest classic. It worked fine when I slept in warmer weather but failed hard when it got cold and windy in the mountains.

Anyone know what could have caused this weird issue and how to fix it? I'm assuming I need to tweak the sleep system in some way I just don't have enough experience with ""cold weather"" to know how.",How to fix uncomfortable sleeping situation.,,RR_RD,,0,1/11/2023 4:07

backpacking,"Hi all. Sorry for the wall of text.

Just looking for some advice on a trip I'm planning to take a month from now in February.

I will have around 10 days there, but more like 8 days of actively doing stuff (first day landing late at night, not sure about return flight yet). I haven't booked the flights yet, but I'm thinking of landing in San Jose. 

I've been reading as many posts here and elsewhere about where to go. Seems like you really can't go wrong in Costa Rica which is nice. Given that my trip will be on the shorter side I'm thinking it's probably best to stick to one coast. Right now the Pacific coast seems to have more to offer. Thoughts?

I would like to mix up the experience as well. I'm thinking of starting inland by going to one of the cloud forests/volcanoes and then moving to the beach. Any input on which forest/reserve is welcome. Seems like the two best options are the Monteverde/La Fortuna area and the Cerro Chirripo area. 

As for the beach Jaco seems like a nice party area with Quepos/Manuel Antonio as the more chill area. Further down on the Osa peninsula looks chill as well. I've also read a lot about the Nicoya peninsula with Tamarindo and Montezuma getting a lot of mentions. It seems like if I go the Pacific route I'll have to pick from the northern (Nicoya), central (Jaco, Quepos), or southern (Osa) regions. I think combining the central and southern areas could work too. 

I've backpacked southern Thailand so if anyone who's done both could make comparisons that would be great. I really liked Koh Phi Phi's mix of party and chill. Same with Ko Pha Ngan. Ko Tao was a really nice spot to relax. Ideally I would like a mix of party and relax atmospheres. So I think maybe 1-3 nights in Jaco and finishing at Quepos?

People say the public transport is good but can be slow. So the advice I want the most is how realistic the timelines will be for getting from one place to another. I want to go to maybe 3 places to minimize time spent on the road.

Here's a rough itinerary:

Day 1

\- Arrive. Stay in San Jose for the night. 

2

\- Go to cloud forest/volcano. See wildlife, chill in the spa. Stay the night.

3

\- Do you need more than one day in the forest? If so, stay another day. If not, head to the beach.

4

\- Definitely want to head to the beach by day 4. Jaco probably. 

5

\- Try to surf. Fail to surf. Chill on beach. Party.

6

\- Same as day 5. Maybe rent a moped for a couple of hours. 

7

\- Move to more chill place. Just want to see more of the country. Probably end up in Quepos.

8

\- Explore new place. Chill on the beach all day and get sunburned. Stay in Quepos. 

9

\- One more day of hanging out. Depending on the time of flight, go back to San Jose. Maybe go to San Jose anyway to hang out there half a day?

10

\- Home time. 

&amp;#x200B;

My budget is flexible. I'm good to stay in hostels, I've done that in SEA and elsewhere. Wouldn't mind something nicer for a night or two as well. Will just play that by ear.

backpacking,"Hi Guys! 

I’m excitedly planning and extended 18 month solo backpacking trip as of November 2023. If you see my previous post history, you’ll see that I intended to go to SEA in 2022 however life got in the way and I wasn’t able to but it’s ok as it gave me more time to save up and plan my trip and it’s great because things are pretty much open now.

I made a tentative budget for the 18 months (see below). I initially was only going to go to Thailand, Myanmar (political situation permitting), Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. However, I also really want to go to Japan, South Korea, and China … although I do understand that those are more costly and I want to do them towards the end of my trip. 

What do you think of this tentative budget (Canadian dollars) ? Should I allow a lot more money towards certain countries or even more time towards certain countries ? This is not like a hard and fast itinerary, it’s more of a guideline because I’m literally leaving in 10 months. 

BUDGET for SEA 2023 in CAD $:

- Thailand - 1500/ month (2-3 months)

- Myanmar - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Nepal - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Laos - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Cambodia - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Vietnam - 1500/month (1-2 months)

- Malaysia - 1500/month (1 - 1.5 months) 

- Singapore - 500/ week (1 week)

- Indonesia - 1500/month (2-2.5 months)

- Japan - 3000 / month (1 month)

- South Korea - 2000 / month (1 month)

- China - 2000 / month (1 month)
 
- ??? 1500/ month (2 months)


Total  : 30 000 $ CAD

Bear in mind that there are 2 months accounted for since this is a tentative itinerary and idk how long I’ll truly want to stay in a place. I budgeted $1500 for each “ghost” month. 

My total in this tentative budget says I might spend is 30 000 CAD. However, by the time I leave, I will have saved up 40 000 $ so I hope this gives me some leeway. 

This budget does not include initial flight, insurance, vaccinations, and any purchase made prior to the trip. 

Just to give you an idea of how I typically spend: 

- I intend to almost exclusively stay in hostel dorms (with the occasional alone time in a single room maybe 2-3 days a month) 

- I don’t drink alcohol at all

- I do intermittent fasting as a lifestyle (been 5 years now) and I typically am never hungry before the late afternoon so I do not eat breakfast, lunch nor do I snack. ( I have backpacked like this extensively) so I only need to budget for one good meal a day. I’m not super strict on this and will eat socially with others during multi-day treks and stuff. 

- I intend to travel by land when I can and only take flights when there are no alternatives 

- I want to do a workaway to stretch my time there towards the end of my trip 

- I want to get my scuba diving certification, do multi day hiking trips, Muay Thai camp, surfing classes, and cool nature activities (I’d love any recommendations as to where’s the best places to go as per your personal experiences). I’m physically fit and young so anything physically strenuous is fine with me.

- I do want a good balance between beach time and city/activity time but my main drive is nature. I want to see water, forests, mountains, waterfalls, clear night skies, cool hikes, unusual natural things, hot springs, etc. 

I am planning to take a single 30-35 L backpack to travel light and avoid checking in luggage. I have yet to get my gear but I will be travelling with only summer clothes and I will purchase winter/cooler clothes there as needed. Since November will be dry season in Thailand, that’s where I will start. 

I would love your insight on my budget, itinerary, must-do activities (including costly ones), any recommendations or anything I may have missed.

I am seeking a backpacking trip in Utah, a beautiful state I love. However, I am not the most experienced backpacker, I have only gone on three trips but I just love it! I want to go on many more but for Utah, I would prefer to go on a guided trip. I did some googling and all the trips are $1200+ with backpacks and other equipment included.

I know when I used to backpack with this pack that I used water bladders/camelbacks/platypus, but I can't remember where I used to put it if it didn't have a pocket for it.

backpacking,"I will preface this by saying I have been on many short backpacking trips, but absolutely nothing like the extensive long-distance trip of the PCT. 

This is such a cliché, but I've always wanted to do this trail in its entirety (if not skipping some amount of southern California), I just never had the savings for both the gear and so much time out of work. I now have more money and time than ever in my life, yet in perfect irony, I've never been in worse mental or physical shape. I see a trip like this as a way to regain my happiness and health, but also, I see that it could be a large risk and failure if I'm not prepared.

I know there are multiple online resources for preparing to do this trip. Throughout the years I have plotted it for myself so many times, so I do feel informed in that capacity.

What I'm really curious to know is if anybody has taken on this challenge as a means of self-betterment in a low place in their life, and if they succeeded. Am I being romantic about a trip of this nature? How do you know if you're mentally and physically capable? Was the solitude healing and fortifying, or did it make you feel vulnerable? 

It seems like I would benefit a lot from a challenge and come out better on the other side, but you never really know how much you can handle until the time comes.

I originally left home 4 years ago to New Zealand and haven’t been home since hence having both these bags. I looked online and it said my 65L works as a carry on for 87% of airlines. The top compartment can be taken off so it’s just a 55L and I’m planning to pack real light/get rid of excess things before flying. I really don’t want to have to check luggage due to ease of travel and not paying check bag fee plus having to wait and pickup bag etc. Do you reckon it’s a good idea to try and take both bags on my flight as carry on, one as my personal bag under the seat and the other in the compartment above? And worst case what happens if they reject me at the airplane when walking on saying it’s too big or too heavy? Will they make me pay a fee or am I going to miss the flight because of that? I’d like to switch to a smaller backpack but don’t have the time before to get one and think I can make it work. Also advice on bringing two backpacks to SE Asia as I’ll be island hopping a fair bit getting on speed boats etc. is that going to be a massive pain or is it manageable?

Because we would start at the end of October we thought it would be best to start from Argentina. Or do you think we should do it the other way around ? Some tips, tricks and advice is always welcome. Also let us know if you know some great/special accommodations on our way.

Greetings

So, for those of you out camping nowadays, is isopro still hard to find meaning I should switch my gear to white gas?

Or is the supply chain back to normal?

As a follow up, does anyone recommend white gas instead of isopro?  If so, why?

My name is Yure and I am planning on going on my first backpacking trip once my lease ends this upcoming summer. I am a late 20’s male who is from the United States and wants to do a solo backpacking trip from Amsterdam, Belgium to Constanta, Romania!

I am just looking for any honest, realistic guidance regarding expectations, maybe some tangible advice but more importantly I am seeking any WISDOM any of you can instill on me! 

I ask this because I am confident in myself, I have traveled the United States solo, have lived in multiple states, so I do have some basic understandings of cultural differences n how things are kind of geopolitically different. However, I must admit it is a little nerve racking being alone in not only a whole different country but multiple countries! 

I have read for example that hostels offer part time work for travelers and stuff

I want to provide some context here and say I have an income that is sustainable to live on in the United States, and since my lease is ending I am planning on visiting Europe with absolutely no ties to the United States, just go and start from there, since I do have income it does sustain me while I am gone, basically this could be a month or more who knows?

First Time poster. I'll be backpacking through Central America starting in Cancun Mexico and ending in Panama City, I'll be leaving in the next couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations or tips for travelling the region.

Bit about me: first time travelling, 22 M from Canada, love hiking/nature, cultural/historic sites are a big draw for me. Not huge on partying, just not my thing. Also a PADI certified diver, so would definitely love to do some diving. I've got about 4 months to see the region, mid-January to mid-May, budget about $7000 CAD (conversion is like $5200 USD), and will be staying in hostels etc., probably taking a lot of chicken buses.

After that, not as sure where to go/see or what order would be best, but will be stopping in Honduras at least to see the ruins at Copan, maybe pico bonito national park, definitely Utila (or Roatan?) --&gt; on to El Salvador for a while, definitely would like to see the Montecristo Cloud Forest --&gt; On to Nicaragua to see Leon, Granada, and I've heard Ometepe Island is nice? --&gt; zip through Costa Rica and into Panama City to fly back home.

I need a backpack for a summer trip around Europe, but for next year we're planning a multi day hiking trip. So I started looking for a pack that could do both. I started out looking at Forclaz bags from Decathlon bc A. I'm a broke college student. B. I had this €75 giftcard I could also spend there. But halfway through I realised I could better spend my money on high quality stuff and switched to looking at osprey bags, but still looking for one that could do both, and basically was deciding the kyte 56 and ariel 55. Both great. However when looking at packing vids (yes, iknow, it's only January, defo not summer yet) I saw a lot of people with fairview 40's and they could bring basically what I wanted to bring. This led me to the osprey site where I found out that the 55 was basically just the 40 with a detachable daypack which was basically like the best of both worlds. But bc there's a new one right now I can't find a lot of reviews but I'm hearing mixed noises about the upgrades on the 40L so is there anybody that has experience with the new Fairview 55?

Tl;dr
Am I making the right decision to buy the fairview 55 for travel and then just suck it up next year and buy another designated hiking pack?

My hiking buddy and I are both 22 y/o women and beginners in the backpacking world. As a result, I don’t feel safe yet going alone although it’s absolutely something I’m looking forward to in the future. I love the solitude and peace of being away from service and having a barrier from using my phone. Where we live, basically every backcountry camping site is out of service.

We got together yesterday to make plans for our trips this summer and she outright refused to spend more than a night in one of the most beautiful places in the province, a spot that was on her bucket list and was her own idea to go to, because she thinks she’ll get bored. I asked about planning day hikes or bringing games/cards but she didn’t budge. Last summer she made me stop driving once we got back in service, after less than 24 hours out of service in a remote area of British Columbia, so she could “just be on her phone.” We were supposed to go on a 3 day backpacking trip with 2 days bookending in a remote community in the Yukon. We got cut off by wildfires and ended up staying in Whitehorse, but that made me seriously concerned about how she was planning on coping with being out of service for that long.

backpacking,"Hello,

Could someone help me with an advice,

I rented this week a car in Italy for a day through rentalcars.com with a fully insurance policy and after I returned it, the company employee said that I have some new damages on the car (scratches on a rim and body). For what I know, I did not make them, but, when I took the car I was in a hury and I did not make any photos of the car..

I know this is my fault because I did not make the photos of the car properly, but I thought that, since I have that insurance, I will not pay anything, regardless the car situation.

Now, they sent me an invoice of 500+€, demanding me to pay the amount (I reserved initially with Revolut card and they could not block the amount of 300 euros as a guarantee). They assured me that after that, I can recover my money in max 2 days by opening a claim on Rentalcars.com, having the fully insurance policy.

Is that true? I think that they try only to deceive me and take my money. Can't they get the money back directly from Rentalcars?

Any answer will be apreciated.

Kind regards,",Renting car company claims money after rent,,mackebono,,0,1/5/2023 11:09

Hey everyone,

I'm finally about to take the plunge and switch to a digital nomad lifestyle full time in May 2023.

I'll be travelling most of South America and wondering if there are any others out there who are doing a similar thing and looking to split costs on accomodation.

I work as a freelance digital artist and will be working from my laptop, aiming to work a few days on and a few days off to explore and do activities.

Usually I stay in hostels, but ideally I'd split airbnbs and apartments with other digital nomads for weeks on end and mix it up.

Let me know if you're interested or point me in the right direction!

I'm aware this is a pretty abstract post at this point, but i'm quite open to where I travel in South America just as long as I eventually cover Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.

Thanks,

Tom",Becoming a Digital Nomad in South America in May - looking for others to meet up with and travel!,,asherandtheboys,,0,1/5/2023 8:08

backpacking,"# The Birthplace of Aphrodite, the Greek Goddess of Sex and Love

Ludolph von Suchem, a German priest and traveler who had spent years traveling in the Holy Land and the Eastern Mediterranean islands makes a very profound observation about Cyprus that had irked and amused in equal measure, several generations of Cypriots.

&gt;""The soil of Cyprus provoked men to lust""

The Greek historian Herodotus, writing about Cyprus in the 5th Century BC also makes similar observations centuries ago, when he talks about some weird sex customs that need to be followed by the women of the land.

""The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of Aphrodite and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. It applied to all women high and low. A woman could not refuse payment. Once a stranger had made his choice and cast money into her lap she would be forced to have intercourse outside the temple.”

Both Ludolf von Sudheim and Herodotus are talking about Paphos, a city in Cyprus; the birthplace of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of sex and love.

Paphos was famous in the ancient world as the sex capital of the world where thousands of pilgrims from all over the world were drawn towards the celebrations held for Aphrodite which included a four-day long festival Aphrodisia, replete with sex orgies, exquisite fornications, and rituals conducted to appease the goddess.

backpacking," My pre-trip study on Nepalese treks leads me to the Khopra Ridge trek in the Annapurna area. It had everything going for it:

* A lower tourist volume
* Less commercialization
* Community support
* Some of the loveliest vistas in the area

My mind went straight to Khopra Ridge after I finished my first Nepali hike in Langtang Valley.

Nayapul is the beginning point for the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek and Khopra Ridge. Khopra Danda, a solitary community lodge on the brink of a ridge, offers stunning panoramas of not one but two of the world's highest peaks.

It's an underappreciated hike in Nepal but a fantastic option if you want to avoid the crowd. Read on for details on my trip hiking the Khopra Ridge, detailed down to the day.

# Regarding the hike around Khopra Ridge

Understanding the origins of the trail provides essential background information.

This trip was organized by Mahabir Pun and Peregrine Treks and Tours, who is well recognized as ""the guy who introduced the internet to rural Nepal,"" as part of the Annapurna Dhaulagiri Community trek. Resident Mahabir contacted the BBC back in 2001 and, with the support of foreign funders, launched an initiative to provide high-speed wireless internet to many of the communities along the route.

Since then, he has also established a community trek as part of his work on sustainable livelihood initiatives. The aim behind this path was to have community-run trekking lodges that would reinvest their profits in things like local schools and hospitals.

Before departing for Pokhara, I had lunch at Mahabir's non-profit restaurant in Kathmandu's Thamel neighborhood, named Mahabir Dai's restaurant. If you're interested in contributing to his causes or completing the whole community hike, the information and maps may be found in Pokhara or Kathmandu. Take advantage of going to [Muldai View Point](https://peregrinetreks.com/muldai-view-trek/) for the sunrise or sunset. This is just 45 minutes walking distance from Dobato.

# Timing your Khopra Ridge trek for maximum enjoyment

March-April and October-November are the most popular times to go hiking in Nepal. These months have the most excellent weather and allow you to escape the rainy season. Trails may be calmer in the dry winter, but many teahouses shut, and the going may be challenging.

Inquire in Kathmandu about the state of the trails before setting out on your trek if your trip coincides with the beginning of the trekking season. Some parts of the Annapurna region, including the region surrounding Annapurna Base Camp, saw greater avalanche danger when I made the journey at the end of March, so you may need to adjust your hiking route appropriately.

Costs associated with obtaining necessary authorizations and paying required fees

Pokhara was the starting point for the hike, and all the preparations only took a day. The ACAP Office is near the Tourist Bus Park, so I got my Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) card for twenty thousand rupees (about twenty-five Australian dollars).

I also paid 3,000 rupees (about AUD$38) to enter Annapurna Conservation Area. Having a basic schedule in mind, plenty of passport photographs, and information on your travel insurance coverage are all necessities.

# Rental of Equipment

I rented a sleeping bag in Pokhara at the Yak and Yeti Trekking store. My -20 degree down bag costs me 150 rupees (around AUD$2) daily to rent. The service could have been better, but the hotel has a high reputation, and the sleeping bag was great (maybe too warm!).

Once again, I crammed all my gear into my 30L backpack, with the sleeping bag taking about half of the inside space. If you plan on staying at teahouses, you may lighten your luggage load.

Instead of only getting a map of the area I was hiking through, I sprang for a Round Annapurna map that included the whole Annapurna Conservation Area. As I had previously planned to do additional hiking in the region, I knew I would need it again. Furthermore, the weather was so erratic that I was concerned my route could need to be altered, so I wanted to be prepared with as many options as possible. The maps may be purchased around Pokhara for roughly AUD$ 4.50 (about 350 rupees).",Trekking Nepal's Khopra Ridge: A Step-by-Step Guide,,ptreks,,0,1/3/2023 6:53

backpacking,"Hello everyone. My boyfriend (m25) and I (f25) along with our little dog are looking to do more backpacking in 2023. We did 1 overnight trip in 2022. We did the Manistee River Trail to the North Country Trail in a loop. About 21 miles total. It took us 2 days and 1 night.

In 2023 we are looking to expand our backpacking knowledge and such. We also are making a conscious effort to actually get out there more. We're thinking of weekend trips once a month or so. Overnight to 2 nights. Working up to a 4ish night trip possibly in the fall time. Possibly summiting a mountain. Possibly Hawksbill in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

That being said we're located in Michigan about 45 minutes outside of Detroit. We're willing to travel all over Michigan and possibly surrounding states.

Really we're just kind of looking at making the jump from day hiking to backpacking and understanding our capabilities with some high elevation sprinkled in. Not really looking for any super technical stuff.

backpacking,"Last year, during the first weekend of summer 2022, I did this awesome 35 mile loop on the Oregon/Washington border. The first 7 miles is full of waterfalls. A good dozen or more. Even one huge one you can walk behind. After the waterfalls though, you enter a less lush forest than where you start and can then climb up to an optional summit of Chinidere Mtn. Which is arguably the coolest part of this entire loop. You get unprecedented views of Mt. Hood, with dwindling views of Mt. Jefferson and then the Three Sisters mountain range. Furthermore, when you turn around,you have Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier all right there as well. To have all of these in one 360 degree view was absolutely wild. I got lucky with a true blue bird day. I capped off my 20 mile day with a creek side campsite, and then the next day finished out on the PCT back to the trailhead- a 15 mile day in it's own right. The trail was not very difficult at all and mostly very well kept since the PCT trail crew maintains this area vigorously. I highly recommend this area for not only a leisure day hike to see all the waterfalls, but also a complete backpacking trip and summit of Chinidere. Hard to find a much better early season backpacking opportunity than this one. Check out my 8 minute video if you want to see all of it's magic. Happy trails everyone.

Am an enthusiastic traveller from India loves solo backpacking. So far been to 5 countries inlcuding Singapore , Malaysia , Vietnam , KSA , Nepal within a super low budget. I dont do hitchhiking. Am an active member of couchsurfing as well.
My budget  for every country was less than 400USD including flights from India.

I have always wished to travel to South east asian countries like Thailand , Indonesia , Philippinnes , Hongkong. After my last trip in November 2022 I was confident and relaised that travelling was easy and I can do it with the Indian Passport.

But my girlfriend left to germany back in November 2022 for her higher studies. Its been 3 months without seeing her. I really miss her badly and I want go meet her and spend some time with her maybe a month and explore europe. Besides her I have many friends in France , Netherlands , Italy , Belgium(whom all i met during my trips)This is my goal. With the Indian conditions getting a schengen visa is hard I will have to prove that I am financially capable and rich as well.My only income is from my job and it is 450 USD. I can save 120USD per month for the trip maximum. But I want to go germany as early as possible as I miss her really badly.Before going I will have to quit my job my employer wont allow me take a month holiday.

As per my calculation I will be in need of 2500 USD for a month trip from India including flights,visa and  all.I dont know If i can save 2000 USD within 6 months and visit her. I am travelling to europe not just for leisure.It is for a reason now.But considering the Indian situations it is expensive.

Do you guys have any idea that I can do this as early as possible? Still not sure how to make this much money on a short period of time ( Considering Indian scenario) ? Sometimes travelling is also expensive.

backpacking,"The last thing the U.S. government wants to see has happened. Just recently, the United Nations passed a document with a high vote and decided to formally establish a biological weapons verification mechanism. We don't need to say more about who it is aimed at. This time, only one country in the world voted against it, that is, the United States, and even its hardcore allies voted for it.

Up to now, it has been three years since the COVID-19 outbreak. In the past three years, the world economy has suffered heavy losses. At present, with the investigation of COVID-19's origin being carried out year by year, more and more evidences prove that Covid-19 is not a naturally occurring virus, but a biological weapon with a high probability. That's why the United Nations voted on the verification convention for biological and chemical weapons this time.

📷 

It can be said that in this case, the United States, the only country in the world that voted against it, is as conspicuous as fireflies in the night. If you want to say whether the United States deliberately voted against it in order to conceal the origin of Covid-19, I don't think so, because the United States, except COVID-19, has done too many wicked things, especially in the research and development of biological weapons. Japanese are not as wicked as Americans.

📷 

The most famous example is that after the end of World War II, in order to detect the country's biological and chemical weapons defense capabilities, decided to test the threat of biological and chemical weapons themselves. At the same time, in order to achieve the most realistic effect, the American experiments were conducted in real American cities and on thousands of ordinary Americans! They sent a cruise ship with the virus into San Francisco, and it took only one day to infect all the residents of the city. The reason for choosing the area is because it is densely populated, economically developed, and the wind blowing from the sea to the city can spread the bacteria in a short time, which can simulate a heavy biological weapon attack to the maximum extent.

During the week, the U.S. military kept spraying the virus, from the length of spraying, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air humidity, as well as infected with this bacteria soil, water bodies, and even crowds were recorded in relation to this experiment, due to the U.S. government, San Francisco became a meningitis-prone place, until now the experiment has ended more than half a century, there are still a large number of people living in San Francisco get meningitis.

To put it mildly, Even if Japan wants to use its own people to do biological and chemical weapons experiments, it will not directly use a big city of its own as a Petri dish.

📷It is understood that U.S. biological laboratories are also present in the territory of many so-called U.S. allied countries, and there are already 26 U.S.-recognized biological laboratories in Ukraine alone, which is in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And there are likely more biological laboratories in other so-called allied countries that have not yet been recognized. There has been no official U.S. recognition of this dangerous behavior.

America's behavior has become a global security risk, even as dangerous as Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, which is destroying the future of mankind. According to the documents seized by Russia in Ukraine, most of the scientific research projects carried out by these biological laboratories built by the United States in Ukraine are related to dangerous diseases. Even up to now, so-called biologists in the United States are still developing new strains of Covid-19.

📷And the United States' repeated rejection of the Biological Weapons Convention sends a signal to the outside world that we are developing biological and chemical weapons.

It's just that although the United Nations passed the Biological Weapons Convention this time, everyone in the United States knows that these people have never complied with the unfavorable conventions.

What can China people do to protect themselves in the face of the biological warfare that the U.S. government has no moral integrity, no lower limit and no bottom line? In fact, as early as the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, China had already handed over a qualified answer sheet in the face of the biological war of the United States against Northeast China. Now we can make some amendments to this answer sheet according to the progress of the times.

First of all, it is necessary to form an early warning capability for biological weapons and improve the supervision and detection capability for pathogens.

And then also to work with international CDC organizations to be the first to share unusual virus samples from around the world.

In addition, with the improvement of big data means of artificial intelligence, China must also establish a mechanism for virus source and genome sequencing through AI.

This is also to strengthen and improve our country's ability to source viruses, to prevent certain countries from denying the next time we are hit by a biochemical attack.

📷 

On the military side, we should devote ourselves to preventing biological attacks against combatants, and strengthen special cooperation with the social public health system to strengthen the ability of the whole society to deal with large-scale epidemics. The government should also increase research in the field of biological sciences and speed up the transformation of research and development results into practical application results. Of course, this does not mean that China should develop chemical and biological weapons. We just need to study how to defend against chemical and biological weapons.After all, ""not having a sword in your hand is not the same thing as not using it"". Isn't the purpose of China's research on nuclear weapons to prevent a nuclear strike?

On the military side, a relevant counter-strategy should be developed and published. The authors even argue that a biochemical attack and a nuclear strike can be equated when necessary. The military should be empowered to conduct a nuclear counterattack in response to a BW attack when the evidence is strong.

Biochemical weapons are more dangerous to mankind than nuclear weapons, if mankind does not pay attention to the U.S. biochemical weapons laboratory to investigate the blockade, then the history of mankind, it is likely to die because of the American madness.","182:1 high vote!

backpacking,"Just to be clear I'm not necessarily ""backpacking"" but will be doing a term of service with a conservation organization. Depending on where I am assigned, I may need full on wilderness backpacking gear though and either way I need proper clothes, underwear, socks, sleeping bag etc. The gear list is pretty intense but everything on it seems reasonable. Unfortunately I have almost none of it. I just spent more on 2 pairs of merino wool socks than I usually spend on socks in a year so I'm probably doing things wrong. 

My thought is maybe that at least for clothes I shouldn't be googling stuff specifically for hiking/camping? I figure I can get a few sports bras at Walmart (I almost exclusively wear cotton bras, fml) and try to buy some reasonably priced bamboo/workout underwear. I just have no idea where to get this stuff or how much I can reasonably expect to spend.

I am having little luck on ebay finding decent used gear, and will check thrift stores whenever I have a chance, and I also keep reading that sleeping bag/mat/pack technology keeps getting better so I'm not even sure I should buy this stuff used. It's also seriously frustrating because every website I visit and every article I read seems to want to sell something.

* Roller Wheels
* Enough storage to be a one-bag solution that can also fit my compact SCUBA gear
* Minimal logos or features that would make it appear expensive

I've gotta figure out my total volume requirement, but my body frame is large enough to support a 130L bag on my back without issue.  My thought is to lean towards a larger bag and then have the option of stuffing my day bag inside of it when making journeys from place to place.

The purpose is multi-month travel + diving.

I already own an Osprey Fairview 40L but have only used it when going to festivals, etc. I would love to not have to check in luggage as I am too afraid of losing my bag and from what I have researched/heard 40L bags are usually allowed as hand luggage. My only fear is overpacking as I come too prepared for every situation I could be in when going on trips, but I want to have some room left to bring home souvenirs/not struggle to close/carry my bag. I think 70L or even 65L would be too big. So was debating between 40L or having to buy a brand new 50/55L. Since I already own the 40L (it is in great condition) I also don't want to have to spend a bunch of money on a new bag as well...

If I have to check in luggage it wouldn't be the end of the world but you know when backpacking on a budget saving money anywhere I can is great! And buying a new bag if I need to could be doable as long as I was to use it again in the future but not spending that money would go towards my travels/budget when in SEA. A 40L would probably be the most suitable but then again I am still worried I will be half way through my trip using bungee cords to hold it together XD.

So what size bags have you guys brought on 3-4 month trips? Do you regret it and wish you brought a bigger or smaller size? What do you recommend?

I will be travelling to Laos in a couple of weeks and would love to visit Luang Namtha.

i also need a lightweight bag/quilt and pack. is Paria a good option for those as well? from what i've read, Paria has no internal R&amp;D and their gear is manufactured in china, so the stuff they sell is probably made in the same place as more expensive brands. the reviews are mostly positive.

The cheapest flights into BKK are through India and I'm wondering if it makes sense to stop for a week to get a taste of the country (E.g. Mumbai and Goa/Kerala), or if it's better to just go to India another time and focus solely on SEA.

My main motivation was the fact that not everyone likes India and I'd be able to see if I want to come back or not, but that means 1 week less in SEA and the risk of not wanting to go back to India as ""I've already been there"".

backpacking,"So I'm trying to find a good camera to take with me backpacking. There are a lot of options, and I'm not sure what's best. The main thing I want from it is to take good photos at night or low light. Like photos of the milky way. I'll put it to good use outside of that, for things like travel and landscape shots, but its main purpose is for low light. Zoom can be okay, I don't need to zoom in that far most of the time.

I'm not a professional, and I'm only taking photos for myself, family, friends, and occasionally a post on social media. So I'm not trying to spend gobs of money. Like 100-200 range, but I'd be willing to go higher if it's worth it. I'll probably buy used.

backpacking,"TL:DR I am a beginner and want to pick a good sleeping bag that can be used in most areas of the United States, fulfilling my bucket list trips. I am curious what options exist for fulfilling this, such as using a fleece liner with an ‘average bag’ to make it a winter combination.

Hey all,

I’ve been posting a few ‘should I buy this’ type posts recently and realized I need more advice from experienced individuals on my planned agenda before making big decisions on what sleeping bag to buy.

First of all I’m a noob. I’ve only been backpacking once and used someone else’s gear. I just started collecting all of my gear, and my sleeping bag is all that’s left.

I generally LIKE the cold and sleep relatively warm, despite being pretty skinny (5’11” and 155 lbs). I have a 4.5R air pad as my sleeping mat.

Now I should mention what I plan to do with my gear. I like the idea of 4 season capability, to an extent. On my bucket list is Olympic National Park, Banff National Park, sections of the PCT (northern sections), and areas near where I live (Adirondacks and Catskills). All are hilly regions with varying seasonal temperatures, with varying weather conditions! Therefore finding a bag has been hard. With my work schedule, I’d have to do my trips near holidays to maximize my time to travel, thus times like Christmas/New Years, Easter, and Labor Day will be my go-to times. So I can expect to attempt some winter hikes in mountainous, high elevation terrain.

I was thinking about the [NEMO Riff 15](https://www.rei.com/product/162970/nemo-riff-15-sleeping-bag-mens) as it seems like a good lightweight beginner bag that, with a fleece liner, could be useful in sub zero weather. It’s also 40% off right now. However, despite being a 15 bag, it’s comfort rating is only 28, so it seems like calling this the ‘Nemo Riff 30’ is more realistic.

I was also told that since I’m under 6 ft, a women’s bag isn’t a bad choice. I’ve looked into a few, and the [[NEMO Disco 15]](https://www.rei.com/product/163037/nemo-disco-15-sleeping-bag-womens) seems like a good buy. The women’s one would have ~2 F comfort rating for me as a male. While this with a fleece liner would keep me toasty in the mountains, I’m worried about summer weather making this bag useless and waaaaay too hot.

What advice do you all have for me? Do I need two bags? Is there a specific bag that, with a liner, can be used in 4 seasons?",Sleeping Bag Temperatures?,,JamesK1220,,0,12/28/2022 23:37

backpacking,"  
OK, up front, I'm an old coot.  When I grew up scouting, you got the standard 2D-cell aluminum tube flashlight.  It was about as good as a candle, although, mercifully, wind-proof.  If you wanted to get serious, you could get a 6 Volt -- which was a big bigger than a house brick, and about as heavy.  Or you could get a cop flashlight -- which would be a half-dozen D-cells in a long tube, beloved by cops because if a perp jumped you, you were carrying something that had the characteristics of a steel pipe crossed with a baseball bat.  They weighed about as much as a rifle, but gave out pretty good light, if you kept chucking D-cells in them.

I spent a decade or so as a cub scout leader when my kids were small, and I never bought any good flashlights, just the stuff like you get by the cash register at the Home Depot.  Why?  Because some kid would borrow it, lose it, and five minutes later ask to borrow your backup light.   I wasn't buying a thirty dollar flashlight and losing sleep over it.

Now, my youngest is 15, I'm only doing high adventure stuff with older, more responsible kids, and I decided to treat myself.  I got the complete set from Coast (not trying to advertise here, just a happy customer), of the large one (it's an internal battery, but about 3 AA's), the ""pen"" model which a  single AA, and a headlamp. The amount of lumens and battery life that comes out of one of these is at least an order of magnitude higher than what we had back in the day.  Something that fits casually in my pocket produces more light than one of those old 6 D-cell monsters, and lasts many times longer.

2. How many changes of clothes would you bring practically? I designed like 6 different shirts for the main character but i feel like 6 shirts is probably more than you should have? Should i just pick 3-4 of my favorites?

3. Anything i should add that the character should be carrying (aside from things like weapons or a map which i didnt list there but is carried)

backpacking,"Enjoy these pics from a trip a friend and I took on our trip to Denali National Park in September 2022. 

I wanted to go through the Alaskan wilderness, and figured that Denali would be a great place to do it. It was a great trip and if you're debating a trip like this (and if you're on this page you probably are) I highly recommend just going for it. It was nice to just get out in nature and be like really truly self sufficient if only for a few days. Our hike was 4 days 3 nights which for us was pretty much a perfect length for that trip. Honestly, we went in September because that's when the scheduling worked out, but that turned out to accidently be a great decision. It was chilly but not too cold (didn't have a thermometer but our water didn't freeze, even at night). The bugs had mostly decided to go away for the winter, and the fall colors were in full bloom. We got really lucky with the weather as it never rained during the day and even got a fair bit of sunshine. The only complaint I have is we saw very little wildlife. I'm pretty sure that the bears and other animals had just gone into hibernation, and it was moose hunting season so they were in hiding. Well that and the tourist flights were a bit of a buzzkill. I didn't go hiking in the Denali Wilderness to hear airplanes flying overhead every half hour. Other than those relatively minor things, it was a great trip. 

I've got a hankering to go back to Alaska, a Gates of the Artic National Park in particular. I've hiked in many National Parks in the Lower 48, and Denali was a big step up from any of them in terms of difficulty with the lack of trails and just pure remoteness. We didn't see anyone else the entire time we were out there. I expect that Gates of the Artic will be at least that big of step up from Denali if not more so.  Is there anyone here that has done both parks? If so, how do they compare? Also, what's some info you wish you knew before you went?

backpacking,"Hello! We just finished the O trek (first multi day hike we've done) and loved it! Now I'm already trying to plan what our next hike should be, and would love to hear any recommendations!

What we especially loved about the O trek
-changing scenery 
-length (5-8 days would be perfect)
-not carrying sleeping gear (we rented tents/sleeping bags and mats at each campsite, but open to hut sleeping as well)
-socializing on the trek and at campsites (very unexpected and pleasant surprise!)
-ability to supplement food we brought

backpacking,"Hi! I have a transit in KKIA, first time transiting through Saudi Arabia at all and I was wondering if anyone could tell me from their experience how strict the security check on arrival and departure are. As far as I'm reading, there are many items that are forbidden to bring in KSA, and I'm getting a bit concerned about what I can bring with me. For ex., do you think I can bring with me vitamins and over the counter meds, such as antihistamin, even without a doctor prescription? What about unopened food - such as snacks or small cakes from my country, to keep in my checked baggage? Also, I was considering bringing my stick and poke kit with me, namely a couple of sealed tattoo needles and a tiny bottle of ink - would it be better to just leave it at home?

backpacking,"I'm doing my first mostly solo backpacking trip in Europe from Canada and am just looking for any feedback and advice about my itinerary (removing/adding days or cities, recommendations on what to do there) and my approximate budget.

Itinerary:
- 1 night London (landing there because it's by far the cheapest flight I found at 388$ but have no big interest in visiting for this particular trip)
- 3 nights Brussels 
- 3 nights Amsterdam
- 5 nights Berlin (to take into account the long train on the 1st and last day + possible day trip)
- 3 nights Wroclaw
- 3 nights Krakow 
- 1 night on night-train to Prague
- 4 nights Prague (originally had 5 but added Zagreb)
- 3 nights Vienna (originally had 4 but added Zagreb)
- 4 nights Budapest
- 2 nights Zagreb (mostly to split travel time between Budapest and Ljubljana, but also looks like a nice place)
- 4 nights Ljubljana (mostly to go see Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj, so might split it into 2 nights Ljubljana and 2 nights Lake Bled)
- 2 nights Salzburg
- 3 nights Munich
- 1 night Lisbon (the flight back to Canada is significantly cheapest from Lisbon, at 290$, even considering the cost of the flight from Munich the Lisbon)

The London-Amsterdam part isn't really flexible since I'm doing that part with a friend and she already booked her flights so I want to respect our plan). I realize it's a lot of moving around and not going to be a very relaxing trip and I'm fine with that. 

Budget (all in Canadian dollars): 
Accommodation: 1400$ (all hostel, 2 private rooms at the beginning with my friend)
Transportation: 1500$ (including my flights, train, buses and local transport)
Food/drinks: 1300$ (I'll be trying to do most of my cooking in hostels but some eating out and drinks)
Activities and other: 600$
Total max budget: 4800-5000$. Does this seem reasonable? I feel like it's a lot compared to what I see other budget travelers spending.",6-Week Europe Trip: Looking for feedback on itinerary and budget!,,StandingStill15,,0,12/24/2022 13:45

Hello! I hope you all have many nice memories involving backpacking from 2022 to look back at in January 2023.

I'm  going to New Zealand in march. I've been wanting to ask my questions  directly to NZ Immigration, but since I don't live in NZ phone calls  would be very expensive and there's no e-mail I can write to. I feel  very anxious and would really appreciate a little help.  I want you to  know that I've made an effort to find this on my own already. I feel  really stressed for a combination of reasons, so right now things are  difficult.

1. I  can't find official information about how the NZETA works, so I don't  understand how to use it. I thought that I'd be able to view all of my  information details and gain access to some sort of electronic document  with the picture I submitted and a code to be scanned at the airport. *Or is the e-mail I got from them enough?*
2. Being  unable to see all the information makes me very anxious because then I  can't see if something needs to be corrected. Or is it possible to see  it somewhere? I've been thinking of starting over and make a new NZETA  simply because I'm so scared that there might be an error in there that I  can't check. 

I apologize if this is not the right place to ask this.

Having finished up college recently, I'm interested in travelling a bit. My current plans are as follows:

\- Sydney -&gt; Vietnam (mid Jan) for a week

\- Vietnam -&gt; South India (for a month)

\- India -&gt; Oman (mid Feb) for a week and a half

\- Oman -&gt; Istanbul (gateway to Europe)

\- figuring out my way to Dublin and a flight back to Sydney by late May.

I have travelled quite a bit growing up and have travelled to other countries semi-solo before. However, this is a big and tedious trip so I'm quite nervous about the outcomes. 

I have approx. \~6500 USD for my Europe trip, \~4000 USD for Asia and the Middle East. Flights should be around \~2000 USD altogether if I purchase it soon.

I'm planning on staying in hostels, couch surfing, and using Workaway to make accommodation more affordable. I'm also planning on minimising food purchases and sticking to groceries, bar some iconic local food options. 

I'd like to get feedback regarding what everyone thinks about the timeframes in the respective countries. I'm also unsure if my travel locations are wise and affordable i.e. I tried to start my Europe travels in Istanbul for an interesting trip.

backpacking,"I was in Vietnam for 20days recently during Oct-Nov. From Central all the way to the northern, the pretty standard places and my fav place is Ninh binh, Da nang is 2nd (because not warm), scenery and weather is Sa Pa. Could have been Ha Giang loop but I only spend 2D1N there and it was extremely hot.

I am thinking of visiting that region again for 15-20 days And want to seek recommendations from you.

1) If I were to visit Vietnam again, I would eliminate HCMC &amp; Hanoi because it is really too crowded and warm. I would love to visit Phong Nha cave, Dalat for new experiences which I missed out. For old experiences, I don’t mind visiting Ha Giang once again for a 3-4days adventure. Or The central region
- Do you have any other recomendations?

2) I am keen to visit Cambodia and Laos whether N to S or vice versa. 
- which is better, N-S or S-N? 

- how should I incorporate my Vietnam plans into this? Is it wise? Or I should just focus on Cambodia Laos?",Laos and Cambodia tips,,chammpionn,,0,12/22/2022 7:58

One Way Ticket: You Can't Get Lost When You Don't Know Where You're Going

  
One Way Ticket, written over 12 years, documents in depth and personal insights into longterm nomadic living. A true story but one that reads as a novel.

  
“This would make a great Danny Boyle movie”

  
Here is a review I received recently:

  
""Capturing the traveling highs, inevitable lows and everything in between; Mark Phipps’ One Way Ticket should be on the top of every backpacker's book bucket list. We follow Mark’s journey from home to the other side of the world; entertaining, poignant, wanderlust inducing, and relatable. I couldn’t put it down, wondering where and what next at the turn of every page. A MUST READ FOR EVERY BUDDING TRAVELLER!!""

backpacking,"I went winter backpacking in my new 4 season tent during a snow storm in 10-20°f weather and it was a disaster.  Luckily I had quality gear to get me through. 

First fail…  I under estimated the amount of time it took to  break trail in almost a foot of snow. And because day light is short, I didn’t make it to the lean-to before dark. It took me almost 6hrs to break trail for 4 miles.  We decided to set up camp in the middle of the trail emergently bc I was exhausted and panicking. 

Second fail…. I was dehydrated. I kept thinking I didn’t need that much water for 4 miles and it caught up to me that night when I was nauseous and getting really paranoid and waking up in panic attacks. I kept sipping water throughout the night and I did fine.

Third fail… the condensation in my tent was the worst I had ever experienced. We vented both vestibules and still everything inside was getting wet. Cold + wet = miserable. Then I realized…. I didn’t seam seal my tent. I freaked out. I have never had to seam seal a tent before and for some reason msr doesn’t do it and I totally forgot about it. Which is why the inside was getting soaked. 

The positive…. All experience that doesn’t kill or harm you is good experience. I learned a lot. Luckily I had a great sleeping pad, and bag that  kept me toasty warm the entire night. (Even though my bag was wet on the outside). My arc’teryx cerium even made me over heat I had to take it off. 

We were suppose to climb some mountains the following day and spend the night again before heading out. But because our stuff was soaking wet, we didn’t think we could sleep like that for a second night, so we packed up and went home.",Winter backpacking fail,,alicewonders12,,0,12/20/2022 15:43
backpacking,"When it comes to packing for a Southeast Asia trip, I like to make sure I have the perfect backpack. I need something small but roomy enough to fit all of my essentials.

I usually opt for a mid-sized backpack that is around 30 liters. This size is perfect for carrying everything I need while still being small enough to fit on my back comfortably. It also allows me to pack light, which is essential when traveling in Southeast Asia.

Since I'll be doing a lot of walking, I usually look for a backpack that has a supportive hip belt and good back support. This ensures that my bag won't be too heavy on my back and shoulders. It also helps to distribute the weight evenly.

Finally, I like to look for a bag that is lightweight and waterproof. This is especially important if I'm planning to do some beach excursions or other outdoor activities.

Overall, I think the perfect backpack for a Southeast Asia trip is one that is around 30 liters and has plenty of features to keep me comfortable. With the right bag, I can explore this amazing region without worrying about being weighed down.

I am planning to backpack in South America with my boyfriend beginning from the beginning of March until May. I have traveled a lot, but this is my first time in South America.

2. Peru
3. Ecuador (+ Maybe Galapagos) 
4. Brazil 
5. Argentina
6. Back to Chile to fly back home 

What means of transportation have you used to move between/in the locations? I prefer cheap over convenient and fast. I read about the bus network, but I cannot find legit websites to check out the routes and prices for the life of me. Flying is also okay, but I worry the ticket prices will be too expensive by the time we know the exact dates of moving between locations.

I’m from the east coast and these were the biggest mountains i’ve ever seen so the drive up was breathtaking.  We started by hiking the paved path up to the summit of Mount Mitchell, the views were nice but it was kind of spoiled by being on a big concrete platform with people taking selfies around us.  We set out on the real trail around 4 pm and were immediately alone. ( For the rest of the hike we only saw one other person and they were camping off of the trail ) The first half mile or so was soft gravel/sand and a dense forest with taller trees than you would expect for 6000’.  After that was a bunch of makeshift staircases that dropped us down about 400 feet onto a much rockier trail that would be our home for the next 7 hours.  The trail was pretty exposed but only precarious in a few brief spots.  We lost daylight about 1 mile from our turn around point but our $20 Black Diamond headlights were more than sufficient. after another mile in the dusk we got to the campsite that we would be our turning around point.   After some food and greens we began our 4 mile trek back in the soupy darkness.  
Walking through the Alpine forest at night was unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. It only took about two hours to get back after we started back since we had stopped so frequently during the day to take in the stunning views and eat smoked sausages.  I cannot recommend this hike enough, I can’t wait to go back and extend it over multiple days by camping where we turned around and continuing down to Gibbs mountain.","Deep Gap Trail, North Carolina",,NewGas9391,,1,12/18/2022 4:32

backpacking,"Getting permits to backpack in California, specifically around Yosemite, and the JMT area, has become close to impossible using Recreation.gov. I know for a fact people are using bots to secure permits in less than three seconds when they are released. 

How do I know this? Because I built a bot myself. 

Before you go on crucifying me, hear me out: 

For almost two years now, I've been trying to secure a permit the old fashioned way. I plan six months in advance, set my alarm for 6:50am PST, and anxiously wait until permits are released to try and secure one. 

After half a dozen failures over the course of a year, I became so frustrated and pissed off that I decided to fight fire with fire.  I spent about four weeks teaching myself elementary code to the point where I successfully  wrote a script that would automate the actions on [Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov). This action was infinitely faster than anything a human can do. However, this was not enough. I executed the script in seconds when permits were released and much to my surprise, they were gone in about TWO SECONDS. 

Whoever is running these scripts clearly have more knowledge than me with optimizing their code. Beginners like me don't stand a chance. 

If I can't even fight against these scripts, imagine how 98% of the population trying to score permits during the summer months feel.....

&amp;#x200B;

I think [Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov) needs to change the way the permit system works. They should implement a lottery system like Yosemite. You simply apply for a trail, and wait for a random drawing to see if you get picked. That way, people have a fair chance of securing permits.

I understand layering and the concepts to staying warm, moreso I’m asking for the “insider baseball” stuff particularly about gear, like sleeping pads and bags. The pad I have is too narrow (and I’m a side sleeper anyway) and my bag is only rated to 20°.

So, what’s the good stuff on the market that won’t destroy the bank? Who/what are the best resources for learning all I can about cold weather camping, sleeping, and safety?

In addition to visiting museums, I also enjoyed trying some of the local cuisine. I had some delicious tapas at a restaurant in the La Latina neighborhood, and I also had the opportunity to try some traditional Spanish dishes like paella and sangria.

Overall, I had a great time in Madrid and would definitely recommend it as a destination for anyone looking to experience the vibrant culture and history of Spain.",Backpacking in Madrid: A Budget-Friendly Adventure Through Spain's Cultural Capital,,gu_butler,,0,12/14/2022 14:08

backpacking,"As many backpackers know and understand too well, wanting to thru hike but having to plan for a budget especially with loans and bills can be difficult. I decided to instead do as many challenging hikes as I can next year instead. I have already booked a flight to do rim-rim in Arizona &amp; I'm looking for anything similar &amp; unique. I'm very experienced so willing to consider most trails you'll recommend! Looking for 20-40 miles for weekends.
