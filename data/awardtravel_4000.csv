awardtravel,"Hoping to plan a Japan ski trip for Jan/Feb 2025. Have a specific route in mind SFO-TYO (stopover for 3-4 days), TYO-CTS, CTS-TYO-SFO and was excited to execute this plan using the free ANA stopover until I realized the obstacle: given that this would be a multi-city booking, I won't be able to book it the usual way (available outbound + dummy return) and change the dates online myself. So now I'm just trying to come up with a plan B:

Would it be possible to book SFO-TYO-CTS RT with no stopover using my usual method and then once the outbound and return dates are set, call ANA to change the layover in TYO to a stopover? I know route changes are not allowed, but I'm not sure if this is considered a route change...

If not, then I guess I'll either 1) book SFO-TYO RT and add a separate domestic flight or take the bullet train to CTS or 2) book one ways on Aeroplan with a stopover on the outbound

awardtravel,"**Background:**  
Ok, so this is my first time booking a flight with miles. Bear with me as I explain some background in this first paragraph. I found some great ""saver award"" flight options on [United.com](https://United.com) and called TK to book. TK couldn't find any ""saver award"" flights on the day I wanted to depart, nor any other day within the entire week for that matter. I even asked them to look ip up by itinerary and they said that it still can't be booked with miles. I understand that booking ""Saver Award"" United flights with TK is a crapshoot and I need to call other reps and also try booking through email. Now, see below for the confusing part.  


**Confusion:**  
The customer service agent said that I could use miles to book an American Airlines itinerary and then she put it on hold for me and I'll have 3 days(?)  to transfer my Capital One miles to TK and ""pay"" for it. I received an email showing the flight reservation. 

AA is my preferred airline because it is the only airline at my small regional airport that flies into Dallas. But, as hard as I look I can't find anything on the internet about booking AA flights through TK using miles????? Was the customer service agent wrong? I'm so confused. I researched booking AA flights with Capital One miles before I looked at United and it looked like there was no way to do it.

Now here's the kicker. When I asked how many miles it would be so I could know how many miles to transfer the agent said she can't view that yet and I'll have to wait two hours or more for the reservation to turn into a confirmation and then I'll see how many miles. I only booked it because from my research the United flight was 10,000 miles through TK and my understanding is that TK will charge about the same number of miles for all eligible same-ish routes. 

# I shouldn't get my hopes up because she probably just booked me a regular fare that I have to pay with cash if I want keep it? Or?

**Reminiscing, mostly unrelated, you really don't need to read any further:**  
And as for the Turkish Airlines slander, I believe you all but I had the opposite experience when I used them while living for a few years in Western Europe. It was through TK that I had my first business class experience and because it was transatlantic it was extra special and I felt like...Cinderella? For the Christmas holidays I paid $850 to fly economy Spain--&gt;US and US--&gt;Prague. After sleeping in and missing my return flight they only had business class available on a later flight and I paid $398 day of to upgrade. I get that wouldn't be a hack but at the time I was sooo amazed that that was all I had to pay to upgrade. 

The food was great on the flight, I was in heaven with my lay flat seat, and having never been to a fancy restaurant the hot towels were peak 5 star service to me. That layover in Istanbul was a huge shock because it was my first time in a lounge and still to this day it's the best lounge I've ever set foot in. Yes, I know that there are fancier lounges, but so far I've only seen the TK Instanbul lounge, TAP's Lisbon lounge, subpar Priority Pass lounges in the states and Mexico, Capital One in Dallas, and some Centurions. For the remainder of my time in Europe I booked TK business whenever I had the opportunity.",Turkish Airlines and American Airlines??,,PoloFieldsReturnee,,0,4/1/2023 23:22
awardtravel,"Hey, I'm coming up on 1 year from departure and started catching up on the strategy here.

I was looking to book two seats in J, but I've learned two important things:

* Only west coast (and JFK) release 2 J at calendar, IAH only releases 1 J
* IAH also doesn't offer F, so there's no possibility to do 1 J, 1 F

Apart from taking a separate flight the next day, the only feasible strategy I see here to get 2 J is to instead:

* Aim to get 2J on SFO-TYO, or LAX-TYO, etc
* Then, book RT to IAH-SFO, or IAH-LAX, whatever - on a separate PNR

Flights (all in economy): 

ORD-HND nonstop - 35K UA. Pitch 31” – sigh. 

KIX-BMP - 7.5K skymiles. 

ICN-LAX-ORD - 38.5K UA with the first leg on the top deck of an Asiana airbus. We’re dorks, excited: never flown upper deck! 

Hotels:

Tokyo (2 nts) Park Hyatt (30k / nt)

We had planned to stay longer in Tokyo, but we’re bumping into a Japanese holiday that weekend (Mountain Day).  And we do want to spend some time in countryside to experience less urban side and to get out of the heat. I had booked (and haven’t yet canceled) Hilton Tokyo Odiaba, but it’s not a standard room so it’s over 90k per night - wasn't feeling it. Hyatt Regency, GH, Hilton Tokyo, Conrad have no availability. Was thinking to transfer TYP and book via Choice / preferred hotels – but now that we were able to book the Park Hyatt, it’s hard to be excited about the Prince Tower or the other Choice options. Oddly, perhaps because their rooms are so spacious, PH is one of the few hotels where we could book a family of four in a standard room. (And staying in PH does seem like the kind of thing we will only do once in our lives.)  I don’t \***think**\* I’ll try for globalist before then, but if availability remains, maybe I can find someone to book us as guests of honor. 

Marriott Fuji Hotel (2 nts) (32k and 38k/nt) (using FNC the second night)

We wanted to see Mt Fuji and Marriott availability tempted us. (Marriott has become the new Radisson for me - so excited whenever I can find a sensible booking.)  Thinking we should probably rent a car (looks like \~$60/day). Not sure if we’ll try to hike up Mt Fuji… we’ve reached the stage where the kids could probably do it more easily than us parents!  

Hyatt Place Kyoto (6 nts) (1st 2 nights u/15K peak, using 2 FNCs – next 4 nights @ 12k)

We hadn’t planned to stay quite so long in Kyoto, but doesn't sense to go back to Tokyo for 1 night. We’re thinking to make Kyoto our base and do some day trips, thinking of Nara, Himeji, Osaka, maybe Hiroshima / Miyajima.

awardtravel,"Hey everyone! I was hoping to get some input on this redemption. My fiance and I are planning a honeymoon later this year and we really wanted to check out Bali, so after a TON of searching and going back and forth (I'm like at least 20 hrs into things at this point...) I THINK I've found a good option, and was hoping to get some feedback before transferring.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we live near DEN, but since I couldn't find a decent flight out of DEN - we're going to make a connection to SFO (probably doing it as cheaply as possible) and then fly from SFO on a straight shot 16hr flight to SIN before heading off to Bali (DPS).

&amp;#x200B;

We have complete flexibility with scheduling and we're looking to go sometime in Aug/Sept, but it can literally be anytime between Aug-Dec if need be. So, the plan is to do Singapore Airlines from SFO - DPS round trip in business class for a total of 514,000 KrisFlyer Miles + $104.70 USD. If my math is correct, this comes in at about 2.89 cpp (getting a good cpp is cool, but at this point, I don't really even care - just so long as it's over 1.5). 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as accommodations once we get there, the plan was to stay at one of the many Hyatt properties for about 5-8k points per night. 

&amp;#x200B;

The timeline looks like a flight out of SFO on 8/09 and arrival in DPS on 8/11 (21.5hr flight in total). Then we'll be leaving on 8/16 from DPS and arriving back in SFO on 8/16. From the sounds of it, we'll basically have 5 days there if I'm reading that right - which sounds suitable for a honeymoon (it won't be activity-packed, mostly just chilling at the hotel and seeing some local sights).

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's the backstory on the trip - but here comes my reservation. Doing this trip the way I suspect is going to be about 600-650k points in total (a mix of AMEX and Chase points most likely). That'll basically deplete my points (built up over 2 years). Now, I know no one else can tell me if it's ""worth it"", but would you guys take this trip if you were in my shoes? If not, what else would you consider (we've thought of just going to the Caribbean, but wherever we go I was hoping to make it something fairly special).

From DFW to HND it’s a JAL flight and then back to DFW with AA.

I have read that you can get JAL F usually with around 85k points but during the time of my booking I did not see any first/business available. Is this just due to there not being availability for award booking that shows up in AA until 14 days prior to day of flight or I’m guessing it’s either all been taken?

My other question is in the case that I may happen to find JAL F, since I booked already as a roundtrip flight instead of separate one way flights would this impact my current return flight with the AA miles I have? I would assume I can just cancel and rebook with the miles credited back but I just don’t know if the same cost of miles would still be applied due to cancel and rebooking.

Yes, you don’t earn IHG points or get to use benefits if you have status, but this is still a huge difference. I contacted the hotel after booking through Citi, and they confirmed all reservation details and that the reservation was paid in full.

awardtravel,"tl;dr: United award travel booking keeps waitlisting me on any Scandinavian Airline (SAS) despite having award seats available. My travel partner is insta-confirmed on their flights.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story: My partner and I were able to book saver United flights from different origins but on the same flights from Chicago (ORD) to AMS and to CPH. I booked almost a week ago (last Wednesday) and got waitlisted for the AMS-CPH flight while she got a confirmed ticket. I got an email that Friday that my flight was canceled and that I would have to rebook. Great.

I called a booking agent and they were able to change both of our flights to a slightly later AMS-CPH  flight with SAS. She confirmed there were 8 award travel seats available. My partner got confirmed and I got waitlisted again. Sunday my flight was auto-canceled.  


Today I called a 3 (or 4th time) and the agent confirmed that I would be waitlisted on every SAS flight. She booked me on an entirely different itinerary that goes through FRA and I'll get to CPH a full 14 hours before my partner and won't have the long layover in AMS.  


I suppose my options are: 1) book cash price AMS-CPH to be on the same flights as my partner. 2) Just deal with arriving 14 hours beforehand and not flying together. 3) Buying a positioning flight to ORD.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll take any advice. It seems like every agent I've dealt with has had an issue confirming tickets with SAS airline. Is there any apparent issue? Is there any other way to get to CPH?

Seems like I have 3 options if you guys don’t have any other suggestions. 

1) Keep the current flight and spend the night in NYC. Not ideal but my brother does live there, would AF compensate?)

2) Take the JFK flight on 6/11 and cancel our United flights home and rebook whatever airline is flying JFK-TPA. This would leave us with a $1000 credit which feels like a waste since we don’t have any travel planned for the rest of the year. 

3) Take the JFK flight on 6/11, keep our EWR flights home and Uber from JFK to EWR. Obviously not ideal but seems like possibly the best option currently. Looked to be about $125 for the ride when I searched last night. Any chance AF would pay for that?

awardtravel,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is more related to r/churning or r/creditcards, but I know a lot of people in this forum have the Cap1 Venture or Venture X and have been asking about this relatively new feature to the card benefit and whether hotels would actually recognize it. I haven't seen anyone post a success story so thought I'd post my own.

My SO and I spent last week in Portugal. We had a TK flight booked via IST to LIS in J from 3/17 - 3/19 with a one night layover in IST (Ik..weird routing but we're pretty new to the award game and this would be our first J experience so we were okay taking a strange routing to LIS). We found out earlier this month that our flight would be leaving earlier on 3/17 and would have us reach LIS on 3/18. The hotel I had already booked in LIS didn't have availability on 3/18 so I thought it might be a perfect time to experiment with the Premier Collection and at the very least, collect 10x points (I've already used the travel credit). The Premier Collection has one hotel in Lisbon: The One Palacio da Anunciada, a new 5 star hotel in one of Lisbon's central downtown neighborhoods. I booked a double room for one night (the third cheapest room) for $417 after taxes and fees. 

The stay was wonderful. At check-in, they informed us that they were able to upgrade us to the garden suite (the second most expensive room and &gt;$500 difference). I did have to ask about the $100 credit which, once they double-checked our reservation, they granted to be used for dining or spa (we used for dining). They also mentioned free breakfast but we didn't end up taking advantage (too full from the night before). We were also granted late checkout but that was subject to availability and we had to call the morning of check-out to confirm. All in all, the deal was tremendous and I can't wait to couple using this in the future with my travel credit.",Capital One Premier Collection...It WORKS!,,g2g2dabathroom89,,0,3/27/2023 17:19

awardtravel,"I received an email today detailing the changes. TLDR, they downgrade the reward program discount from 10% to 2%.

Previously you got a stamp with 10% of the value of the night for each night, and when you had 10 stamps you could use the average value of the 10 stamps for a new booking, effectively a 10% discount.

Now, with ""One Key"" you just earn 2% right away without having to save 10 stamps.

https://www.hotels.com/one-key

While I'm slightly pissed about this and think it will be slightly counterproductive (as the 10% discount was enough to keep me on Hotels.com, the poor 2% discount means I'll now just go wherever is cheapest), at least it seems like the transition to the new system will be fair, and you'll get your full stamps value in ""OneKeyCash"".

Then for Japan airlines it seems like I would have to jump through some hoops to book my flight through American airlines with my AMEX points. I think I can transfer with British airways and then transfer to AA but not sure on time delay for that...

awardtravel,"Hi all,

Looking for some recommendations on hotels in KL for 3days/4 nights then onto Bali in the summer.

I have a party of 9 with some older folks and some toddlers so location is pretty important and the itinerary is relatively light. Booking 3 rooms given party size.

**Day 1** We planned on doing some sort of half day tour with petronas tours  + central market + KLCC Park/evening light show

**Day 2**: Eco Park, Art Museum + National Mosque visit

**Day 3**: Sunway lagoon or swap for something else if it's a ""must see""

I have Hilton Diamond, Marriott Platinum, and IHG Diamond with decent amount of points for all three. Club Lounge access would be nice.  I do have a little more Marriott points than the others so that is a potential consideration I guess. 

I had narrowed down to a few places including:

\-**Doubletree Hilton KL** \- a family member stayed here with a party of 6 and had a good time with the mall access for food etc, close to KLCC park. 20k/night

\-**JW Marriott** I just liked the way the hotel rooms looked. Not too sure about location tbh. 15k/night

**-Intercontinental Kuala Lumpur**, - basically same location as Doubletree  i.e. close to the KLCC park. 17k/night

\-**Majestic Hotel** (Marriott)- close to the ECO park area, 15k/night

&amp;#x200B;

Sheraton seemed older so I took that off the list. Ritz points avail wasn't avail and I think they don't give platinum breakfast anyway. St Regis was a bit too many points so it out of reach, Hyatt I don't have status and seemed like bad value since the cash price is cheap. I know there are other options like MO, Four seasons, etc that are cheap since its KL, but it's a 2 week trip so we are looking to spend $$ on nice experiences/food and want to use points for the hotels.

awardtravel,"Hi. I'm currently looking at options to book some flights and wanted a second opinion on options.

Wanting to do a booking for 6 at the end of summer. 

Chances are, so last minute economy booking is the way, and the ""first"" options do not look enticing anyways. 

Not the most fond of WN/SWA and options for the dates I saw were either cash price or something crazy with 2 layovers in 10 hours one way, so I also disregarded that option. 

HA/HAL was 20k Hawaiian, which is not worth the MR since it would be 1 CPP. (less after $6 fee)

UA/UAL as an option on miles and doubt I can find Turkish availability at all, especially not for 6. Aeroplan had united for Aeroplan for 12.5k one way, with a higher fees of about $45 USD pp.

AS/ASA as an option, with Avios. From what I see, it looks like the best option, 13k Avios + $6USD pp. 

Figured I'd fly the route cash from HNL to OGG since the only option was HA. 

Other thoughts were if it would be better to pay cash with an Alaska Biz card and use my+my friends Companion Fares. This would require a route back from OGG-HNL to use the round trip if my research is correct. I would also need to open and or DD the AS biz cards too. 

This all seems better than paying cash through AS or HA which are all about $400 RT.

But because of how early we are in the AA year, this is also a bit of a decision point for me — should I try to get AS MVP status (which will take fewer flights) or aim for AA Gold (which I can direct travel spend toward)?

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- I have about 6,000 AA status points already, as much from hotel stays as from flying (although I’ve flown six times since March 1). I don’t have any AS points. 
- I live on the East Coast near an AA hub (DCA) which is also my favorite local airport. Most of my flying will involve this airport and happen on AA, not AS. So far this year, I’ve flown for cost reasons on B6, which is the only reason I have AA status points already.  
- I fly coast-to-coast about once a quarter, almost always on AS, and fly a shorter haul about once a month.

If I credit the flight to AA and chase AA status, I’ll receive fewer overall loyalty points for my flying, but more options to get loyalty points overall throughout the year. (I’m also part of the AA dining program.)

If I credit the flight to AS, I’ll probably get MVP status faster and without having to muck around with the AA shopping system, but I’ll have no way to get loyalty points without flying. 

If it helps, JUST this flight will get me 28% of the way to AA MVP status.

But if I credit it to AA, all my flying this year — and my AA shopping — will only get me about 21% of the way to Gold.

PointsPros.  PointsPros were the first company I reached out to and they ended up being least helpful.  I paid them the $25 Internal Research Fee and never heard back.  I tried to reach  out a few times with no response.  The site would not let me log in, I tried password reset but said my email does not exist.  The $25 was taken out of my account so I know they got payment.  Could I have gotten my email address wrong when I paid the deposit ?  Possibly… 

 

Chat Flights.  I was happy to find out right off the bat that I could get some info from them prior to paying a fee.  I entered in all my points info and where and when we wanted to go.  In the chat window the site told me we had about 140 chats in front of us but someone will reach out in the next few days.    After about a week I got a message that they closed operations due to Covid and would be back up soon.  I resubmitted my info and after about a week got the same response.  I did it a third time and after about a week I finally had someone who chatted back with some info.  They gave me a few ideas, and recommended Cathy Pacific for 170,000 per person round trip with no stopover.  They  said taxes and fees for this flight will be aprox $900 each.    I asked for other options as we thought about it and specifically asked for something that allows a stopover.  I didn’t sense the person I was chatting with was overly interested in finding additional information for me.  I told them we would think it over for now.   

 

Point.me  As I was in the process of getting info from Chat Flights I ran across a review on this site for Point.me.   The person specifically said they worked with James and the experiences was great.  I quickly found the site, filled out the info and paid another $25 goodwill fee.   I was contacted via email almost instantly getting a bit more info from me.   I was told an agent will contact me in the next few days for the next step.  The next morning I was pleasantly surprised to have an email in my inbox from James.  He had put together 3 sample flight packages (all one way) the airlines he offered were Eva, JAL and Cathy.  Both EVA and Cathy offered a stopover.   In the end we booked EVA for 87.5K points one way each way and added on an additional 5k points to spend a few nights in Taipei on the way out.    From the time I received the first email from James to booking the outbound flights was 2 days.  Then 2 weeks later he contacted me again with offers for return flights, we booked via Eva again. 

 

In the end we spent a total of 360K points and paid just under $500 in taxes and other booking fees.  We also paid a total of $400 for the service of James at Point.me.   Our trip will be San Francisco to Taipei for two nights before heading to Thailand for 2 weeks.   All flights are Eva business class.   

 I doubt I’ll be using a booking service in a few years from now after we earn enough points for another trip, but I’m glad I spent  the $400 this time.   I easily could have ended up spending more than $400 in taxes and fuel surcharges if I  didn’t have all the options James presented.

awardtravel,"I’m 20 years old and my dad passed away last year.

He was the only one making money in our family. My mom is on disability, and my twin brother and I are both in college. 

He loved to travel. We always took weekend trips to the nearby beach, or visited cities during break. It was a nice getaway from all the work he was putting in to keep my family afloat.

When he passed, we had no income but wanted to travel to continue his passion of exploration. That’s when I came across this subreddit.

I started back in August, applying for my 2nd credit card and my mom’s first. To be frank, the learning curve was fairly steep, but I knew this was the fastest, cheapest, and most fun way to travel.

Recently, I applied for the Barclay Aviator card. I didn't specify an AA number but I was able to create a new AA account using the same personal info and e-mail that was shut down. When my card came, it had no AA number attached to it. 

I've inquired Barclay about attaching the newly created AA number that I made and they said I would have to wait at least 30 days for Barclay to assign a number, then I could change it. Of course, after 30 days, nothing was created. I submitted a ticket for Barclay to investigate. 

During the 30 days, I met the requirement for the signup bonus (spend $1 to earn 60k AA miles). Barclay deposited the miles somewhere. Not sure where.

I have a hunch this road block may be stemming from the Dec. 2019 shutdown. I thought by being able to create a new account using the same personal info and e-mail, that all was forgiven and I could start on a clean slate.

* 150k+$134 USD (converted from CAD)
* 120k+$560 USD
* 90k+$975 USD

I didn't know this was going to pop up. I quickly did some math, and figured that because my cash contribution to make up for the points is going at a rate of roughly 1.4 cpp, I would rather save those points for another booking later and chose the 90k+$975 USD option.

We need to travel from IND to DEL, but since IND is a smaller airport, we can go to ORD and come back either in a taxi or with a connecting flight, but IND is definitely preferred.

We are planning on transferring points with the 30% bonus offered by C1 to Virgin Red soon, and already have 34k there, so this seems to be the best option. I can't think of anything better, but please let me know if you guys have any ideas for this.

AA has a lot of flights back to IND (basically every day) for 40k points each + $\~200-$300 in taxes, and we were looking at those for my Dad.

All transfers were made within a span of an hour. These were the transfers made in the following order:
1. 35,000 P1 MR to P2’s VS
2. 1,000 P1 MR to P2’s VS
3. 3,000 P1 MR to P2’s VS

5. 30,000 P2 MR to P2’s VS
The first transfer of 35K points never made it to VS. The four subsequent transfers appeared on VS instantly. So we are missing 35K points. 

It’s now been two weeks since the points went missing. Throughout this period, we have called Amex 13 times and VS 4 times. They keep bouncing us back to each other. I have had 6 cases open with Amex and it keeps getting closed because the backend office at Amex cannot comprehend that we are missing 35K points in the VS account. VS keeps responding to Amex’s cases just stating that VS sees 35K points and Amex takes that at face value and assumes that those are the missing points. Wtf? 

It doesn’t look like too many others have run into this issue with VS but it seems like they are having some serious IT issues. Will keep you all posted if this ever gets resolved.

We have Y flights booked for this summer including a flight back from LHR to LAX (home airport). We got these OW for crazy cheap, maybe 48k points total. Our last stop on our trip is to Amsterdam, then we’ll need to travel to LHR and spend the night there before traveling home. Instead, for 238k MR to FB we could all fly from AMS to AUS, spend the night there, then catch a SW flight the next day to LAX or, even better, BUR. 

This seems like a very decent late in the game summer option at 68k per adult and 51k per kid. I’ve done probably 750k total churn this year going through most of the Amex personal cards and a few others, and don’t expect to do quite that well each year between P1 and P2, but maybe more like 500-600k?

awardtravel,"Originally had a UA flight booked in Y for my trip but through some alerts that I'd set, I was able to snag JAL F on the outbound (JFK-HND) and ANA J on the inbound. For my dates atleast (March 4 - 15), there seemed to be a lot more JAL availability than there was ANA. I was curious about ANA after hearing so much about it. So having experienced both I thought I would do a comparison of the two. I burned 80k AA miles for the JAL F flight and 45k VS miles (\~30k in Citi points due to the transfer bonus) + $430 in taxes, for those wondering. 

&amp;#x200B;

A big caveat of the comparison obviously will be that I flew First in JAL and Business in ANA, maybe someone else who has done both can comment on this. 

JAL: 

Soft product - Personally, I was **very** impressed. The FAs were obviously attentive and polite but was surprised me was was how they were just the right amount of personable as well. The senior FA was always a few steps away and a delight to chat with. She gave me a bunch of travel advice for Japan, as it was my first time going. I was beaming the entire flight and truly was made to feel like royalty, as I'm sure the rest of the cabin was as well. The food was quite decent. I tried pretty much everything on the menu. The caviar (of which I had two servings) was excellent. The booze might have been the highlight, I must have polished off at least a bottle of the delicious sake + a few glasses of cristal. I also loved that the menu came in the form of a leather booklet instead of a flimsy paper (looking at you ANA). There was the choice between a firm and soft topper for the seat, which went a long way in making the already comfortable seat even more so. I was given a great Shieseido amenity kit which was much appreciated. Shortly before landing, the FAs went to each passenger to ask about their experience and offered small tokens of appreciation. I was given some beauty masks, as well as the JAL mug that I had made an offhanded compliment about sometime during the service. Very thoughtful. There was a family of 3 in my cabin with a toddler, and the FAs got her a very nice looking basket of Japanese toys and snacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hard product - I was very pleasantly surprised by how plush the leather seat was. I'm broad and at 6'1, I had no trouble fitting into the seat very comfortably and slept a good 6-7 hours. The controls were pretty exhaustive, and included lumbar support. The tray table was robust and it slid back and forth smoothly. Although I was traveling alone and so had no use for it, the footrest area that doubled over as a companion bench to facilitate shared meals and also seemed quite comfortable. One of the other passengers in F had a friend in J who would frequently be over to sit with him, which seemed like a nice add-on, especially for a 13h+ flight.  Overall, everything just worked flawlessly. No complaints.

&amp;#x200B;

ANA: 

Soft product - Unsurprisingly, the ANA FAs were also very kind and attentive. The big difference I noticed here though was that there wasn't the same level of attention to detail. The FAs were also not nearly as personable as they were on JAL. The relationship also felt slightly more transactional. Again, I was very spoilt by my outbound flight on JAL so I'm very likely just being a picky asshole here but it's hard not to compare. The F vs J comparison is another variance that I can't account for. The food was kind of mediocre ( I had the Japanese meal). There was no caviar. In the snack menu, I tried the ramen and the chicken sandwich, both were not great. If the JAL meal was a 7.5/10, I would put this at 5.5-6/10. Granted, I was flying back from the food mecca of the world so that might have factored into my rating here but I remember getting off the JAL flight absolutely stuffed, whereas after my ANA flight I got some food at the airport immediately afterwards. The booze selection was nothing special but what really bummed me out was that after my second glass of the sake, they ran out. This is 3h into the flight and the J cabin was at 60% or so capacity. The other sake option was a very dry one, that i wasn't a fond of. The champagne selection was also not nearly as nice. I had a glass of the Hibiki (of which they no longer serve the 21 or 17 anymore, only the blended version) and it was decent but I wasn't too impressed. The Chivas 21 on the JAL flight was much nicer. The food (and drinks) also took quite a while longer to come out than they did in JAL but again, that may have been a cabin difference. The menu also came out on this very thin paper, which is admittedly a small detail but rubbed me the wrong way - I've seen a card menu in trips I've taken in Y on other airlines. Moving on, I didn't notice any mattress toppers, which was a bit of a disappointment. The amenity kit was a Globetrotter bag, with an assortment of cosmetic products. Most people left theirs behind. It seemed like F got the same kit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hard product - This was probably my biggest gripe. Despite doing a good amount of research, I somehow missed that the seat is a few inches too short. I couldn't lie flat, and had to lie on my side in a slightly awkward position. Since I'm not usually a side sleeper, I think I only averaged 2-3 hours of sleep. To me, this was unpardonable. Everything else I can make my peace with but if I can't sleep flat on my back on international 13h+ J flights, what is the point? Outside of that, the seat is quite wide which is very nice. I preferred the longer wooden panel of JAL since I like keeping my ipad, books etc on the side as opposed to stowing them away which is what I did on this ANA flight. I did love the 'room', however. I had read some comments about it feeling claustrophobic but despite being someone who is claustrophobic, I did not feel that way at all. The privacy was quite nice. The buttons worked pretty well and I had no issues getting the screen up/down at any point. Same goes for the seat. I don't remember noticing any lumbar support though, which would have been nice. The 4K screen was also excellent. Ultimately, from a stylistic and comfort standpoint, I did prefer the leather, La-Premiere style seat of JAL to the modern, sofa-type seat of ANA. The suite enclosure in JAL would have made it perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it wasn't obvious enough, I vastly preferred the JAL flight and will likely be vying for that over ANA for any subsequent trips to Japan. I definitely came into this expecting to enjoy the ANA flight experience more, perhaps because of all the hype, so maybe this review will provide a much-needed dose of realism to all the ANA hype. Also curious about the experience of others.

AF - 80k + $200 fees. Is this as good as it gets for West Coast? Or are there better saver awards?

VS - 75.5k + $898 fees. Pretty crazy.... Didn't see any Delta one options. Are there normally?

UA - don't see any saver awards

TK - 45k + $425 fees (transfer in IST)

Are these essentially all of the options out there? Is there anything else I'm missing? And do these seem reasonable?

Last night, got notification that the Pisa to London leg has changed airports, now landing in LGW.  (Same flight #s, times shifted earlier by 10 min)  I do have a 5 hour layover but am now concerned about collecting baggage (might have to check), immigration, travel between airports, etc.  I called AA and they were unsurprisingly less than helpful and said they'd only help on the day of travel if factors directly within their control lead to a missed connection.  They also said I could call BA but warned me I should expect no help there.

I tried to call in and switch to a flight PSA-LGW, LGW-JFK but by the time I got off hold the award seats were gone.  (We live outside Philly so EWR is much better, but I'd rather do a ground connection in US than abroad)

Hoping the hive mind here can help me think this through.  I see my options like this:

  
1) Status quo.  5 hours is a healthy connection time for LGW-LHR.  I do have 7 Corners travel insurance and while I don't think that'll cover if I just have a bad time at Customs, it could help if something extraordinary happens.

2) Stalk the AA flight LGW-JFK and try to see if it comes back (expertflyer?)

3) Call BA and... something?

4) Scrap it and find an entirely different itinerary.  Still needs to depart 4/5 from the Pisa/Genoa area, possibly as far as Milan.  (Rome would be a stretch).  We will have no car so need to rely on Italian trains.  We can leave from La Spezia around 7 or 8am but that cuts out a lot of early flights I see from Milan.

Me and P2 are planning to go to Korea and Japan in August, flying out from the East coast. We would ideally burn some of our points (200k Chase UR, 150k CapOne) to fly at least one leg in business. We prefer nonstop routes and want to avoid layovers in Asia (layover somewhere in the US on the way back is fine since the availability to JFK is rather limited). Additionally, we have little flexibility regarding travel dates due to required overlap with family. So three weeks in total (as in 15 business days), starting sometime between Aug 5th and 13th.  
I have booked refundable flights as a backup (Delta, 2.3k pP refundable - crazy how expensive this has gotten). The plan is to keep checking for open spots on either leg and hope that maybe closer to the departure date we get lucky and I can cancel the cash tickets.

The only options I see are KE or OZ.  
For KE, I would have to use Flying Blue. However, I have not been able to find any KE availability on Flying Blue for KE (tested various dates between March and December). Just found some flights on AF metal with layover in Paris. Tested with Delta and also had no success finding any KE award availability.  
For OZ, I checked Lifemiles and Aeroplan. The good news is that if OZ shows award availability I also see it via LifeMiles and Aeroplan. The bad news is that there is not a single day with business class availability till the end of the year. Hence, I don't really know how pricing looks like.  
So the only option I currently see would be to keep checking/hoping for OZ availability. How likely is it with OZ for business class to open up in the weeks before departure?  


2. Return  
So ideally I would find NH J but I am aware that the chances of this working out are slim. Assuming that for some reason something opens up, I can choose between VA Flying Club, Krisflyer, Aeroplan, MileagePlus, and LifeMiles to book. Would Flying Club still be the best value even after the recent deval? Which routes to the US should I consider as alternative to just NYC only in order to increase my chances? I guess I would be pretty much open to anything in the US. as long as the layover isn't too bad.  


\- United has a lot of availability for beginning of September but it's outrageously priced at 200k.  
\- Aeroplan shows nothing useful, only flights with 1+ layovers at 300k+.  
\- FC shows nothing as usual  
\- Delta has flights with layover (one of which I booked cash) but price for J is astronomical with 400k  
\- Krisflyer shows some waitlisted with layover in Singapore at 213k.  


Seems like the only option that makes sense from a redemption point of view is to hope for NH seats to open up.

awardtravel,"I read the sidebar and a lot of threads here on the Chase UR portal, but didn’t see all my questions answered, so hope it is okay to post.

This is for international travel. The round trip flight is $964 if we pay outright.

If we book through Chase, the round trip flight is 77K points flat.

If we book through Delta, the round flight is 63K points + $197. Similar story on American. 

My questions are:

1-We prefer not to have to spend any $$ to book the flight, but have read the stories on here about booking through Chase and never being ticketed, or being double-booked in a seat with someone that booked directly through the airline and they got the seat instead, etc. Does this happen often or do we just hear about the bad scenarios and many of you do book through UR portals?

2-If we book with Chase UR, and are ticketed appropriately, would everything show up in my Delta app and at that point we’d be “safe”? I hear about people not being notified of flight changes etc. but don’t understand how that’s possible if it all shows up in your app?

3-Are we able to use miles to pay for a preferred seat on Delta?

Itinerary: YYZ-JFK-HND (YYZ-JFK with AC and JFK-HND with ANA)

Travel dates: have a 2-3 day departure window that we can be flexible with in September

Redeeming ANA ticket using Aeroplan points

Currently I found 2 economy award tickets within the departure window but we are hoping we can luck out and find J class tickets down the road. Trying to understand my options and what would you do?

1. Redeem economy now or wait?

* For the YYZ-JFK leg with AC - is there limited seat award availability or you can use Aeroplan to redeem as long as there is cash seat available?
* For the JFK-HND leg with ANA - does ANA release more availability over time or is it generally T-14 or is it usually a fixed amount of seats? Wondering if I risk losing these 2 economy tickets if I don't book it now.

2. Booking economy award now with future changes

* We are open to changing departure date/time if we see J class tickets open up (assuming best likelihood is T-14 window?). Based on that, does it make most sense to book a Flex reward?
* Point difference between Standard/Flex is 12K and Flex/Latitude is 20K
* If booking Flex reward - is an upgrade to J class (no change in flight) still a $100 change fee or do you only pay the point difference? Given we have two legs and assuming availability on both, does the $100 change fee apply to both legs or it would cost $200? AC policy reads it's per direction but want to double check interpretation
* Does $100 change fee allow any date/time change if I'm just moving it up/down my 2-3 day departure window?

3. For those who have taken a late night departure with ANA to TYO, what is the abbreviated meal service like for J and F? Are you only just offered the Anytime menu and nothing else? Wondering if there's a huge difference between a daytime vs nighttime departure flight in terms of experience for J and if there's a huge difference between J and F if it is a nighttime departure (found 1 night time F spot!).

Been lurking for a bit trying to educate myself in this world of rewards travel. 


I’m attempting to use/transfer MR points for the first time ever on an upcoming travel plans to London (any airport) on 6/29/2023. From NYC (any airport)

I don’t care for business or first class. I’m all about just getting there as efficiently(cost/time) as possible. 

I began this search using skyscanner and google flights first to see what airlines/flights are available for my date/city + to get a sense of the cash price they’re  going for. 

Currently economy flights from NYC to LONDON one way are around $632~ on 6/29 with option on UNITED, AIR CANADA, DELTA, Virgin Atlantic, and JetBlue. 

Because of JetBlues 250:200 rate that’s a clear no. 

Delta is 1:1 and it’s showing to cost me 64,000 miles + $5 taxes. That’s ehh. 

United didn’t seem to have my flight available for rewards on my dates. 

Air Canada has a flight for $632 cash but with 1hr layover. It’ll be 50.1k points + $40~ cash - if I math that out it’ll be roughly 1.18 cpp (?). 

Finally, Virgin Atlantic, has direct flight for $632 cash or 20k points + $152 cash so that comes to 2.4cpp ? 

It seems virgin is the clear choice for me.

I have been learning and preparing for hard dates for March 2024. P2 and I leave this Friday for a domestic trip, but plan to book flights for 2024 while on the trip when airfare opens up.

So, all of my research is based on what the current schedules are, but my plan is to book as soon as things open up. P2 is a teacher, so we are stuck to specific dates, but, I'm confident with the amount of research and help that we can still make some great redemptions.

**The trip is St. Louis to London on March 15, 2024. The return is March 23, 2024, Amsterdam back to St. Louis.**

**March 15, 2024**

St. Louis to Chicago Midway, early flight on WN. It's an hour flight. P2 is a teacher, but will take the day off so we can be to Midway by 9am or so. Not convenient, but we'll have to get to ORD, so either Uber, Taxi, or drag our bags on the train to get to ORD.

But, knowing we would have luggage and unable to check in to the hotel until the afternoon, considering the later flight that gets in at 3pm and taking advantage of 3-4 hours in the Iberia lounge. Good use of time since we'll actually have that access?

**March 19-21** Take the Eurostar to Brussels for two nights. Hotel availability with Hyatt not showing yet for SLH hotel Julianna. This is the plan that once it opens up I'll book there. 

**March 21** Take the Eurostar to Amsterdam to finish out the trip. Booked two nights at Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht for 50k Hyatt points.

7:00am - 9:00pm

United seems to have availability to get us straight back to STL for basically the same price with this itinerary to end up back in the states. Shows 77k UA Miles + 108 in taxes and fees. Plan to transfer these from UR to United to book. Might be able to swing something back to the states for a few less points, but then would have to have a separate flight back to STL, and it seems like the convenience factor of this would be great. 

**What Am I Missing? (Besides the fact that availability hasn't opened up and all of my research may prove to be in vain.)**

I have seen that Iberia has a pretty reasonable $30-50 redeposit miles fee, so I'm a bit more comfortable with this itinerary. Currently, I'm seeing UA flights to LHR straight from STL to LHR this weekend (one year out) for 60k biz class, so I figured it I stumble on something like that, I'll take the $30-50 fee and have something different. But, I like the idea of having a secured flight in biz class early on.

I also realize the MDW to ORD transfer might be insane. The 4:45 departure from ORD to MAD gives us the morning to get there.

awardtravel,"I’ve been coming across a lot of questions about how to book award flights on ANA, so I thought I'd make a post compiling all of the tips and tricks I've learned from 2 recent award bookings (SFO-NRT on ANA J and SFO-TPE-HKG on EVA J).

First, there are multiple ways to book ANA flights to Japan - directly via ANA or through partner airlines such as Virgin Atlantic (VS), Air Canada Aeroplan (AP), and United MileagePlus (UA). There are pros and cons to each method:

VS: Has more transfer partners, including Chase, and allows one-way bookings. However, the search and booking process is roundabout and tedious. You cannot search the VS calendar directly. You have to search for availability through another Star Alliance partner like United or Aeroplan and then call in to VS to book. Surcharges are high and similar to booking with ANA directly.

AP: Has the most transfer partners, including Chase and Amex, and allows one way bookings. Their calendar is also easy to use and opens up just as far as ANAs (355 days in advance). The flights cost double the points of ANA but with significantly lower surcharges. I think in a situation where you prefer to use more points and pay less cash, it would make sense to use AP. 

UA: Can transfer Chase UR and allows one way bookings. Calendar is easy to use but only opens up to 330 days in advance. Therefore, there’s usually no availability left after they are booked via other methods. The only UA availability I’ve seen are last minute ones within 2 weeks. UA also charges more points but lower fees. 

ANA: Amex is the only transfer partner, and it takes 3-4 days to complete the transfer. The calendar can be a little tricky to navigate, and they only allow roundtrip bookings. However, their calendar is open 355 days in advance, and the seat releases are very consistent and predictable. In addition, they allow free, unlimited changes. Redemption rates are great but surcharges are high.

Overall, I would say the best options are ANA and Aeroplan, and the choice between the 2 depends on 1) whether you want to pay more points or cash and 2) if you can be bothered to learn how to navigate the ANA booking system. Since I’ve experienced a recent codeshare disaster, I would always recommend booking directly with an airline. It will make your life much easier on the off chance that there are changes and cancellations.

The rest of the post will focus on tips and tricks for booking directly through ANA.

For US to Japan routes, ANA releases 2 business class seats per flight 355 days in advance. Only roundtrip bookings are allowed, and the redemption rates vary from 75k (low season) to 90k (high season) for one RT ticket. The surcharges are high at about $750 per RT ticket. 

Navigating the calendar: 

First of all, set your account location to Japan and language to English. That way, you will be able to see one day farther on the calendar. Each new calendar date is released and bookable at 9am JST. When searching, it’s best to focus on the last available week on the award calendar (at the time of this post, that would be the week of Feb 26, 2024). ANA business class seats are usually booked within hours to days of release so it’s rarely if ever useful to look for anything prior to that timeline; any earlier flights will most likely be waitlisted. It’s not recommended to book waitlisted flights since the chance of clearing the waitlist is low. 

Transferring points: 

Since it takes 3-4 days for Amex MR to transfer to ANA, I would not wait until you find the specific dates that you want before transferring. I would start tracking the ANA calendar a few weeks to a month prior to your desired start date to get a sense of how regular the releases and availabilities are.  Once you’ve gotten the hang of checking at the right time and can find availability for the desired number of seats almost everyday, then it’s safe to transfer with the understanding that you might need to be flexible within a few days.

Booking a dummy return: 

Since ANA only allows RT bookings but seats get booked very quickly, you need a way to hold your outbound seats while waiting for the desired return date to be released. In order to do this, you need to book your desired outbound with a dummy return. For example, the last 2 available dates on the calendar right now are 3/1/2024 and 3/2/2024. Let’s say you want to leave 3/1/2024 and there are 2 available seats, you would book a RT departing 3/1/2024 and returning 3/2/2024 (this is the dummy return). Then, you will keep tracking the calendar until your desired return date is available. Let’s say you want to return 3/9/2024. You will keep tracking for another week and when the 3/9/2024 date is released at 9am JST, you will go into your existing booking and change the 3/2/2024 flight to the 3/9/2024 one. Of note, you are allowed to use a waitlisted flight as the dummy return. The only difference is that you will not be charged any points or fees until you change it to an available flight. If your dummy return is an available flight, then you will be charged the points and fees upfront. Either way, you are allowed free unlimited date and time changes as long as the route remains the same. For this purpose, NRT and HND are considered the same airport so you are allowed to change between the 2. 

Adding a stopover:

On international flights departing outside of Japan, ANA allows one stopover exceeding 24 hours at no extra cost. For example, if you are flying from San Francisco to Sapporo, you can add a 2-day stopover in Tokyo at no extra cost. Just use the multi-city/multi-class search function to find availability from SFO-TYO, TYO-CTS, and CTS-SFO. The final cost will be the same as SFO-CTS RT. This rule also applies to partners as I booked SFO to HKG with a 3 day stopover in TPE at the same price on EVA. 

Booking a Star Alliance partner flight:

Many of the themes are similar with a few minor differences. First, the redemption rates and surcharges are different. One RT business flight on a Star Alliance partner costs between 55k and 120k depending on the zones of travel. For example, North America to Asia is 95k, and North America to Europe is 88k. Surcharges will likely depend on the airline, but for EVA I paid $350 per person RT, which is half the price of ANA surcharges. The other major difference is that both legs need to be available to book a partner flight; waitlisted flights are not allowed as part of the booking. Lastly, the consistency of award availability is dependent on the partner airline. While I found ANA releases to be regular and predictable, this was not the case with EVA and definitely caused some anxiety. The ANA calendar is also even more difficult to use when searching partner awards (there are some tricks like using the multi-city/multi-class search function but will not go into details for the purpose of this post), so it’s helpful to correlate with other partner calendars that are easier to use - Aeroplan is a good one.

2019 - transferred 290k to ANA from Amex. Booked my parents RTW trip, BOM - ADD - EZE - PTY - LAX  - TPE - BKK - CCU. 2 x 145k miles

2019 - Schedule change. Cancel ticket for free. Rebook 4 of us (me, my wife, parents) LAS - PTY - EZE - PTY - LAX. Possibly transferred more miles.

2020 - Covid. Argentina plan canceled for March 2020. Redeposit miles 4 free.

2021 - mileage extension.
2022 - booked Round trip for wife ORD - ADD - SEZ - ADD - ORD and RTW for me, ORD - ADD - SEZ - ADD - BOM - NRT - LAX. Family emergency. Canceled my RTW, 3000 miles penalty. Wife flew itinerary, I did SEZ trip with wife using other miles + cash.

Booked me and wife, LAX - TPE - CEB - TPE - SFO. I didn't think could extend miles further as expiring in 2023 April (I was wrong, could extend to 2024 now). But got a great itinerary from usa to Philippines (for a Boracay trip) and locked it in, planning to pay 3000 × 2 fee if better Europe or Africa for June-July 2023 popped up.

awardtravel,"Earlier this week, I made [THIS POST*](https://old.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/11l1yoo/practicing_searches_how_to_make_sure_to_hit_every/) about understanding points, transfers and partners for a trip I am planning for my wife and I to London, Brussels, and Amsterdam in March 2024. I'm trying to plan ahead because I know award travel is based upon availability. Thus, another question to make sure I am still on the right path of understanding things.

Ultimately, the question is this: is it NECESSARY to book international award travel as early as possible?

To clarify, in running the previous searches, and even looking at different dates now, I've found wide availability with basically all of the flights listed on the previous posts. Every Friday I have searched have basically been wide open with those flights...BUT, I decided to get creative, and I ran a search from the east coast to London Gatwick instead of LHR. In doing so with Air France, I found a random Delta flight that was 66k points and $10 in fees as opposed to the AF/KLM flights that are constantly available. It didn't take long for this to disappear.

Thus, just to make sure I don't rush into booking in the next two weeks, is the sole purpose of booking flights as soon as they become available through transfer partners and airline partners for the reason listed above? Delta releases flights to AF, and when they're gone, they're gone...but, the AF/KLM flight to the same airport will have wide availability?

I'm coming up on the 350-360 day mark, which I know is when award flights start being released. Just want to make sure that I'm understanding that partner flights are what we chase after, but they are going to go quickly and may not be found. But, the other carriers I've looked at (Iberia, Avianca, AF/KLM, etc) will typically have availability with higher fees and connecting airports?

I hope my question is clear. I simply don't want to make the assumption it is best for me to make a purchase as soon as things are available (for instance, booking Iberia to LHR for March 2024), when I will have time to be patient and try to find one of the ""better"" flights such as a Delta One flight direct, but using AF points?

*On the previous post, I never updated the numerous more searches I ran, and I finally feel confident in what I'm doing with points, transfers, etc. **So, to anyone trying to learn**...look at that post, and then spend hours running searches to figure things out about flight options, carriers, transfer partners, etc. If your MR/UR/C1 points will transfer to an airline...research it.",Booking Flights A Year Out...Continuing the Attempt to Understand,,mra101485,,0,3/12/2023 2:11

My question is should I get the reserve/platinum and go for delta platinum status this year (would earn it around June), or should I break that spend up across other cards and get points in more valuable programs (AA/United/citi/chase/etc). I would say overall CC per year is around 50k.

Some info:

* Located in Seattle (Delta and Alaska are strong here).
* Fly to Europe (BUD or BEG) 3 times per year. SEA-BUD is served by Finnair with much better departure times (6pm from SEA, noon from BUD) on both ends than Delta/AF (mostly 1pm from SEA, 6am from BUD).
* BEG is not served by OneWorld at all (SkyTeam/Star Alliance/independents/low-cost). BUD has both SkyTeam and OneWorld.
* Fly domestically mostly to SoCal and Hawaii.
* Around 50k miles flown per year.
* Finnair business class to Europe is much cheaper than Delta/AF. Alaska is slightly cheaper than Delta for domestic flights.

Main reasons are better departure times and cheaper tickets, potentially splurging for business seats if they are on sale. The main drawback is no OneWorld flights to BEG.

awardtravel,"So I booked tickets for the parents on the United portal. Cash (credit) booking, economy seats. Flight date is Apr 16 departure DLA to BRU, with connecting flight Apr 17 BRU to IAD. DLA to BRU is operated by SN Brussels and BRU to IAD is on united. 

I have 40,000 united miles so decided to upgrade my parents. 

DLA to BRU: SN Brussels is the partner carrier for DLA-BRU, and there is no upgrade availability through united portal.  

BRU to IAD: Option 1: 20,000 miles per passenger for united premium (waitlist). It says $448 to upgrade with cash, so 2.24 cents per miles

 Second option is 20,000 miles + $550 for United Polaris Business (waitlist). Cash ticket was approx. $5336, so a 4.18 cents per mile.

 So two questions:

1. Is the united premium seats a good deal at 2.24 cents per mile? Reading their description online and they seem to be equivalent to ""business"" class on small US  domestic flights.

2. Are the united polaris worth it at 4.18 cents per mile only for BRU to IAD leg? Also, the $5300 is what shows if i want to  upgrade seat for the BRU to IAD (United operator), i dont have the option to upgrade on the SN flight. If i search for a direct flight from DLA to IAD on united, I get business class options for as low as $3500 for both legs. 

Also, this is my first time posting and also my first time trying to increase the value of my miles. In the past i use to just use them for domestic tickets assuming 1 cent per mile was a good return. Thanks!","United Premium Plus upgrade for 20,000 miles vs $448 cash?",,NewUserND,,0,3/10/2023 6:57

awardtravel,"I will be traveling back and forth between the US and western Europe (mostly France/Switzerland) quite frequently. United and AirFrance/KLM seem to have the best flights by far.

I prefer AirFrance and KLM's product but so far I've been extremely impressed with booking award travel through United. Much more consistent availability and lower taxes. Most importantly though - no change fees.

I spent 2 months trying to find a decent flight for this summer and ended up booking a crappy AirFrance itinerary with 3 layovers (yes, it sucks). Despite looking for 2 months and finding nothing better, *of course* 1 week after making the booking, I find a much better AirFrance flight for less money and only 1 layover.

But there's a $56 change fee per person* and I already spent $200 selecting exit row seats which *apparently can't be refunded* when you cancel a flight, only applied to another flight with the exact same start/end airports within 1 year. I couldn't apply it to the new flight I found, so it was wasted money.

Ultimately I didn't end up changing my flight, but I'm annoyed that this would have been a painless process had I booked through United. We're only flying Y class (not baller enough for anything more yet) so all these little fees add up to more than the award redemption value.

This post is sort of a rant - but would also love to know if this experience is normal or if Flying Blue is known for strict rules. I'm really only familiar with United and Flying Blue.

awardtravel,"Hi all, was hoping to solicit some advice from the experts.

I am planning a trip to Portugal in April (I know, not a lot of lead time) and while I found a decent redemption to Europe, I have had a terrible time finding one back.

I am trying to get from Portugal (Lisbon or Porto, ideally probably Porto but either is doable) to Los Angeles on any of April 21-23 (could maybe even flex another day in either direction if there's a great redemption).  Cash positioning flights are acceptable; 2 stoppers are acceptable.  Only 1 traveler.

I would very much like to do at least the TALT portion in a premium class (this is the sticking point); ideally business, but I'd take premium economy or consider shelling out for first.

The best option I've found is a UA flight for 151.3k UA + $52 LIS-EWR-LAX in Polaris.  The second best option I've found is VS LHR-LAX for 67.5k MR + $750 in Upper Class, plus a cash positioning flight in economy to get to LHR (probably ~$250); the fees on this one make it pretty rough.  Another option is AC LIS-YYZ-LAX, with LIS-YYZ in PE and YYZ-LAX in economy for 84.7k MR + $83.

I'm planning to go with the UA option (I am a UA Gold so there's a preference toward booking with UA for PQP earning and flexibility/cancel-ability; obviously MR transfers are not reversible) but just wanted to poll the community if anyone had any sweet spots I'd missed.  I've been tearing through every FF program I can think of out of every European hub I can think of and haven't found any more reasonable redemptions.

My dilemma is... I was hoping to book Business Class if I could.  The options I scoped out are:

1. Transfer to AsiaMiles at 1:1 value, which would get us Business Class award fare tickets BUT whenever I search on the AsiaMiles site... no reward tickets ever seem to be available (I've tried +/- a few days, just covering Vancouver to HK leg, etc. but no luck.  
2. Use my points to buy a business class set directly at 2cpp (100 pts = $2).  I'd have to pay the difference as right now any business class seat is at least $4k pp.  So I'd still be out of pocket about $14,000.  Which, for 5 business class tickets is a good deal I guess but is it worth it? Best I could find was on Philippine Airlines and I'm not even sure that is worth spending my points on as I've heard not the best soft product.  But it is a direct flight...

So I'm hoping someone can advise me on the following:

1. Will there ever be any reward fares avail on Cathay Pacific or other airline that I could use?  Or have I completely missed the 350-365 day window?  Would it make sense to transfer to Avios and find a route there?

I am in the middle of booking a trip to Barcelona from JFK.

I wanted to confirm with more experienced travelers the right procedure to book a Qsuite on QA through AA and if anyone had recommendations/suggestion on going to Singapore with a stop in Doha with QA.
My overall plan is to surprise my S.O by getting us a Q-suite in a travel around October-November 2023 with 3 different travels :
* JFK-DOH-SIN
* SIN-BOM
* BOM-DOH-JFK
DOH is only present for the Q-suites. Singapore is the main travel destination and Bombay is to meet with my S.O.’s relatives.

QA booking :

* I did a bit of research, including reading different articles between TPG, Reddit and others
* I believe [this article from Thrifty Traveler](https://thriftytraveler.com/guides/points/book-qatar-qsuites-with-points-miles/) seemed pretty good
* Can you confirm that the only to book a Qsuite as an award ticket on QA through AA is to call AA bookings ?
* It still is 70k AA points for a one-way award ticket from the US East Coast towards anywhere in South-East Asia ? 
* How do you know before the call if the award space is available for a specific date or a specific month ? My goal would be to book tickets for October or November this year, so it's somewhat flexible but it's approaching fast.

Travelling to Singapore :

* Any advice or anything I should be aware of when it comes to travelling to Singapore ?
* Anything that I need to double check on traveling through DOH ? Looking at the current schedule on JFK-DOH-SIN flights, I believe the typical connection is 4-hours so it shouldn't be an issue.

I am currently a United Mileage plus Silver member and I have a lot of upcoming domestic travel and want to go forward by either continuing to pursue United Status or choose another airline. 

I just graduated college and used to travel twice a year between Chicago and Amman, Jordan on Royal Jordanian. Due to this trip, I gained Royal Jordanian Gold (which is probably the easiest move to gold possible on anything I have seen). This gave me Oneworld Sapphire status which was great for American Airlines. I discovered that AA gives Oneworld Sapphire status members access to both their Flagship lounges and their Admirals club on ANY AA route! This is contrary to having AA Elite status which does not even get you any lounge access on domestic routes in Economy. I unfortunately lost my RJ status due to changes in my travel schedule and did not continue pursuing it because the points are worth absolutely nothing. RJ points on any partner redemptions are never available and when they are the redemption values are comedically low and they charge ludicrous fuel surcharges on their own award flights. 

I discovered that United does the same and does not allow their Gold members access to their lounges on domestic flights and only allows other Star Alliance Gold members in. 

I am trying to choose an airline program that is either Star Alliance or Oneworld that has an easy route to Gold/Sapphire status, valuable points and easy redemptions on domestic US travel and US-Europe travel. My favorite programs that I transfer to currently are anything Avios and United.

Personally, I have stayed at Stowe mountain's The Lodge at Spruce Peak (Hyatt), sort of a ski in/ski out, besides the fact that you'd have to take the gondola to get to harder terrain which takes about 5-10 minutes depending on the crowd. I didn't actually use any points for this, but rather booked through AMEX travel and used the AMEX Platinum $200 hotel/resorts credit. Accommodations were great, at the time since I got the $100 special amenity credit to use towards food and beverage. The spa was separate, but we paid only $35 per person for full access. It was perfect for unwinding after a day of skiing. Unfortunately, I didn't have my Explorist status yet, otherwise an upgraded room would've been sweet. The room was your typical hotel room, plus a mini kitchen that had an electric stovetop and a fireplace. Considering my good experience with Hyatt thus far, I plan on staying with them for the foreseeable future.

I've procured a list of other **Hyatt** resorts that are in close proximity to or next to the lifts. Order isn't in any particular order. I'm mostly basing these locations off the two popular season passes EPICPASS and IKON pass.

The gist: I'm a grad student with 160k UR stationed out of DTW. My partner lives in Germany and I'm surprising her with Taylor Swift tickets in LA for August 9th. I'm looking to book her Economy flight tickets for FRA-LAX-DTW-FRA and was originally hoping to use the United Excursionist perk on the middle leg. Currently I can book something like FRA-(DEN)-LAX for 70k + fees, LAX-DTW for 0k, and DTW-FRA for 30k, for a total of 100k pts + fees. I'd appreciate any advice on how I can do a better job. It makes me hesitate to part with so many points, especially since learning about their worth with Hyatt (and booking a 2-night suite in LA for 45k). We'd like to put cash savings towards other life goals right now (the concert tickets were a favor payback from a close friend) but if this redemption seems awful, I can justify it. 

More details: My goal is to fly her from FRA (or MUC or AMS) the 1st or 2nd week of August into LAX (or SAN) and attend the concert. Then we'll fly from LAX to DTW on 8/10 to spend another week or so together with our friends, before she leaves 8/19-ish back to FRA. There's tons of saver space for her return flight to Germany, but I'm only seeing award availability for multi-stop flights ~70k pts for FRA-LAX in early August. 

Is there any chance that the nonstop FRA-LAX flights will release better award availability closer to departure?

Waiting almost a week from when I found the awards, to getting all the points transferred was excruciating.  I woke up everyday hoping the points there and then checking to make sure the awards are still available.

1) Sets up a link between the bank and the airline, which I believe speeds up the transfer.

awardtravel,"I wrote this a few months ago but never got around to posting it. Trip was in July 2022.  


**TL;DR**

My wife had use or lose vacation days and didn't give me a lot of notice. Booked a 6 night trip in Maui for the two of us. Flew from TPA to OGG, all on Southwest with **112k RR** points earned while earning companion pass. Hotel was 6 nights at Lahaina Shores Beach Resort, **96k UR** points (transferred to Hyatt). Route was TPA-MCI (no plane change)-PHX-OGG-SMF-DAL-TPA.  


**Flight notes/getting there and back:**  


I know what you're thinking, flying in Y from Florida to Hawaii sounds miserable. Thankfully, we had enough priority boarding reimbursements with my two Southwest cards to be able to sit in the front row (lots of extra legroom) on most of the legs. We did have to separate one time so I'd be able to sit up there (I'm 6'6""). That experience made me realize business class was going to be a necessity moving forward for international trips.  


I sat next to a fellow churner on the MCI-PHX leg (can't remember his name, it's been a few months). We shared some tips and stories and were both working on the 5 free nights Marriott card at the time, something my wife got a kick out of. Right before we landed, he gave us a barcode to get into the Escape lounge, which was incredibly nice of him. If you're reading this, let me know if you're ever in the Tampa Bay area and I'll buy you a drink or something.  


We slept in the Sacramento airport overnight on the way back which wasn't too bad. We were tired enough that we made it work and it was only a few hours.  


The line for TSA at OGG when we were trying to leave was incredibly long, there were hundreds of people outside in the hot sun. We were probably in the sun for a solid hour, they finally brought water out because people were starting to get testy. Kind of surprised no one passed out, we were packed close together and it was really hot out there.  


**Hotel:**  


The Lahaina Shores Beach Resort was a little nicer than I expected. We chose it because it was the cheapest non-Waikiki Hyatt in Hawaii and was condo-style with a full kitchen, which was important to us because we wanted a place to easily prep food the night before adventuring all day. We didn't go down to the hotel beach because it's pretty bad. The hotel pool is nice enough but quite small. There's a concierge in the lobby you can use to book excursions that we didn't use. They give you bottled water in your hotel fridge and we were able to get more by asking the front desk. We had a mountain view room since that's all they had available at the time, ocean view would have been stunning. But that didn't matter too much to us because we really only used our hotel as a place to shower, cook and sleep.  


**Food:**  


We can usually pack everything we need for a week-long trip in one backpack each so we used the extra bags Southwest lets you bring for free on beach chairs and a suitcase full of non-perishable food so we wouldn't have to buy it in Hawaii. That turned out to be an outstanding idea.  


From doing some reading online, Island Grocery Depot is the cheapest grocery store in Maui; we went to the one in Lahaina. It was still extremely expensive. Bought stuff to make sandwiches, bagels, some produce and some other small things to supplement what we had brought and it still came out to well over $100.  


We ate out a couple times, nothing that really stands out though. Leoda's Pie Shop was highly recommended by Reddit and the Shaka Guide app (more on that later) and it did not disappoint.  


**Rental Car:**  


Booked a 2015 VW Jetta through Turo for $671 for 7 days (my wife and I were both 23 at the time so it would have been cheaper if we were older). The couple we rented the car from were extremely friendly and helpful and gave outstanding advice on what lesser-known places to try out. Also had a box of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts waiting for us in the car (!) They picked us up from the airport, took us to the car, did a walk-around and gave us the keys. Then we returned the car to the same spot and they gave us a ride to the airport. No shenanigans with cleaning fees, phantom damage claims, etc. They were extremely friendly and helpful with excellent communication throughout. I'd be happy to provide a link to their Turo profile upon request, just send me a chat.  


**Itinerary:**  


First, I want to highly recommend you get the Shaka Guide app (or one of the others, though I can't vouch for those). $30 got us all 6 of the Maui tours, though some of them are redundant. There are 2 Haleakala ones, 3 Road to Hana ones, and a West Maui Coastline tour. So realistically, it's 3 tours for $30, which is still 100% worth it. We would have missed soooo many interesting little stops on the side of the road (like a barely visible lava tube cave) if we didn't have it. It also does a great job telling you where to find parking and what to skip. There were several times we'd see a group of cars stopped and the app would say ""you'll see a big group here. Don't stop here, keep going ahead and you'll have a much better view of the same thing and it'll be less crowded"" and the advice was always spot-on.  


If you want to go to Waiʻānapanapa State Park (famous black sand beach on the Road to Hana), you need to make a reservation ahead of time online. That's a fairly new thing we didn't know about so we unfortunately missed it. Likewise, you need to make reservations if you're going to see the sunrise at Haleakala.  


We went for the sunset then slept in our car for a bit until it was pitch black and got to see the Milky Way (Haleakala is an internationally recognized dark sky park). It was spectacular and much less crowded than the sunrise, from what I've heard. I'd recommend going for the sunset instead of sunrise tbh. No reservation, less crowded, plus stargazing. It does get extremely cold up there though, bring a winter coat. I saw a lot of people make a big deal about ""driving down Haleakala in the dark""... I don't get the fuss. Go slow and use your headlights and you'll be totally fine. The road was well-maintained and nothing to be scared of.  


If I could do it over again, I'd spend more time hiking at Haleakala, it was definitely the best part of the trip. We did one long hike through a bamboo forest and some other really cool scenery to get to a huge waterfall that I highly recommend.  


The west Maui coastline tour I mentioned is an absolute must-do. I might have enjoyed it more than the road to Hana.  


Road to Hana is great, I don't have anything more to add that hasn't already been said.  


We did a snorkel boat tour that was supposed to go to Lanai, unfortunately the water was murky that day or something so we went just off of Slaughterhouse Beach. Snorkeling there was fantastic, my only other experience with it was off the beaches at St. John and this was much better (although I swam with tons of sea turtles there so it's apples and oranges). Tons of different amazing fish and saw 2 octopuses.  


The town of Lahaina is kind of touristy for my taste, we didn't spend much time there but the giant banyan tree is something to see. We have them here in Florida but nothing close to that big.

awardtravel,"I'm making my itinerary for a round-the-world ticket via Oneworld, using  awards miles. I think I've messed it up - any help is welcome and appreciated.

I plan to use a combination of American Miles (169k), Amex points (393k), and Chase (144k). I used the Oneworld Explorer page to figure out the flights so that I could go find award space on American and/or Cathay Pacific and then call Asia Miles and book (my point of reference is a frequent traveler site I use often, and, the guide lists only Cathay and Qantas for Oneworld carriers with whom one can book a RTW ticket). It did not dawn on my dim head that I couldn't convert AA miles to Asia Miles. 

Full route is 32024 miles (30069 if open jaw distance doesn't count against total, but either way it falls in the 25-35k range on the price chart) for a total of 210k miles due for business, or 300k for first.

What is the best approach here? Is there any? There does not appear to be an option to book a RTW with AA (unless I'm paying cash - which defeats the purpose, and, I can neither justify it or afford it).  Would I have to transfer a full 240k from amex/chase to Asia Miles? The whole point of going with Oneworld was that I have AA miles, but are they useless for this?

I prefer Marriott since I have 140k pts, a 40k free night certificate, and ambassador status. However, I'm open to other suggestions that provide great value/experience

Location is important since we will only have 2 nights there to explore. Other than that, it's our first time so we don't know much about the area. I will try to use SNAs at whichever one I pick.

**Thu, Apr 13 - Virgin 12:33 PM – 9:08 PM - $129 or 11,500 miles (but the flight time sucks midday)**

**Thu, Apr 13 - Delta 9:50 PM – 6:27 AM+1 - $239 or 20,500 miles (better time)**

for return

Hey all. I've taken a new job that will have me traveling quite a bit. I'm imagining 40+ flights a year and of course that means hotel stays. Which airlines and hotel chains provide the best perks for staying loyal to them?

I'm not entirely picky on either. Flights are flights. I prefer to board the plane as late as I can (carry on only for me) so I'm not sitting on the plane for a long time. Nicer seats are always a plus but I've made due with basic ones. As far as hotels, I'm not really picky either. I'm not a breakfast eater, so the complimentary breakfasts never appeal to me outside of maybe grabbing a quick juice or bagel. As long as I have Wifi and a TV Guide that actually works, I feel like its a good hotel.

I'm planning a trip from AMS to DPS later this year, and it would be a great opportunity to finally try Qatar Business and its Qsuites.

Their customer service is no help as well, saying only: 'No sir, this is the only way of booking with cash + Avios, it must be on that page'. After that, they told me that I had to pay using a credit card first and that I could refund a part of the paid amount by using Avios, which seems strange to me. This also contrasts with what they say on their how-to page.

Am I doing something wrong here? The website says that I need at least 1250 Avios to do this, which I have, and paying first and redeeming points later just seems very odd.

From the perspective of racking up points, it's working out great. Getting 4x points on groceries and restaurants is perfect for my family. Here's the problem - I can't spend them. My schedule doesn't allow me to play the game to maximize points for flights and the points are basically trash for everything else. The Jet Blue conversions sucks, and Avelo doesn't take AMEX. I can get better deals on hotels on Priceline. Paying with an Amex Gold feels like a bit of a flex, but I'm starting to think it's a stupid flex.  


I'm seriously considering burning up my MR points on a statement credit and switching to either Chase or Capital One. Here are my thoughts. I would love feedback from Chase or Capital One people about the ease and value of redeeming.   


Capital One Pros: Capital One Venture has an Avelo card with nice bonus offer. Since I fly to Florida  about 1x (sometimes more) per year on Avelo, at least I can use points for that. It's 2x points on everything, plus 5x on hotels and rental cars for a $95 annual fee. TSA pre check and preferred Avelo boarding.   


Capital One Cons: Only getting 2x points on my big spend items - restaurants and groceries. Harder to rack up points overall.   


Chase Freedom/Sapphire Combo Pros: Get 3% on restaurants, great travel benefits, one year of 5% on groceries. Redeem for higher value with Chase Travel. Seems like it would MUCH easier to get good value redeeming through Chase.

tl;dr:

* Phone agents apparently don't get fed information from their automated system, and also can't access your profile?  (or else I just had an inexperienced agent?)
* Good reminder there may be additional flight options for a route which only show if you use multi-city.
* If you use it too much, the multi-city search search will start complaining that you have invalid dates, even if you don't (I had originally started out using a flexible date search)
* To fix this, go back to the non-multi-city search, un-select ""flexible dates"", and set dates.
* If you transfer points and refresh the last booking screen, the website shows your excess points (beyond what's needed for booking) as a negative number.

Detailed summary of my multiple hours of un-fun:

* Found 45k premium economy route to Europe during high season (July-Aug) that looks appealing.  Didn't like one segment though, and found an earlier flight that wasn't offered up when going through the standing booking flow.

* Called the 800 number.  Told the Automated system dates, starting and ending airports, and number of travelers.  Agent answered surprisingly quickly... maybe 5 minutes?

* Told Agent what I wanted to put an award booking on hold BEFORE I transfer points in, but United's website don't let you do that. She said by default you can't do that, but she went offline and then came back and said we can.

* Explain that the website not offering the earlier flight to me.  Can't recall the term she used, but basically she said that the route was a package deal and that it would need to be booked multi-city.  I slap my forehead for not thinking of this earlier (I must be out of practice!)

* Asked agent to price it out with the earlier flight.  She re-asks all the same questions from the automated system (number of travelers, starting and ending airports, dates) and prices it out to... the same price.

* I request that she put it on hold so I can transfer points.  She asks names of travelers.  I point out that they are already on my profile and she can get them from there, but.... apparently they can't.  So I spell everything out and provide birthdays.

* And then wait for a confirmation number.   And wait lots of minutes more.  She says its as if her system is hung.  She goes offline to something else (different computer/terminal?) and comes back saying that it isn't taking and suggests I book it through the website.

* I thought about asking her to resubmit since we already had everything in place, but I had no confidence that would work - and since there were plenty of seats, I said I'd do it myself.  Hung up with the reservation line.

* Played around with multi-city search more to see if there were other options I'd prefer.  Ended up getting the multi-city page stuck complaining about invalid return dates even though I triple checked them.  Finally went back to start over and notice that flexible dates was still selected, and after de-selecting that, found that the website had set the outbound and return dates were set the same.

* Finally settled on an itinerary and got to the final screen to see how many points I needed to transfer.  Had 7500 left over from previous, so it said I need 262.5k more.  Transfer of 263k from Chase was instant.  

* Held my breath as I refreshed the itinerary/payment page, and now it said I need -500 points in order to book

* I was laughing/crying enough at this point I may have overlooked it, but I didn't see the ""complete purchase"" button - so I went through the multi-city process one last time, being the semi-expert on it that I am now.

Bonus:

After spending so much time on their website, I noticed they have at least two, and maybe three different interfaces for searching:

* The main page search, which allows you to specify premium economy
* Advanced search, which allows multi-city, but lumps premium economy with std economy
* A completely different multi-city interface that I'm not even sure how I landed on (revise search maybe?), which doesn't have the date bug",United award website bugs and general booking un-fun,,HonestEditor,,0,2/27/2023 13:51

I just got my first flight rewards credit card, so this is all pretty foreign to me.

I am planning a trip from Pennsylvania to Taipei for December through American Airlines. I have been entering dates with the ""redeem miles"" button, but everything comes up as ""sorry, this isn't available."" But I checked- AA does indeed fly to Taipei on all the dates I checked. Once I uncheck the box all flights come up.

Is it likely that award miles can only be redeemed from/to certain cities? I have typed in a few other major hubs feom the US that I can think of, but nothing comes up. But I checked the AA awards map-- it says I can fly from North America to Taipei for 75000, so I'm a bit confused. Can you only redeem award miles from certain hubs, and is it up to you to find out what those hubs are?

awardtravel,"I'm a bit confused on my reservation. I had booked bkk-auh-ist business on 787s in J on etihad, a new to me airline. Also ist-mct-bkk one the way home, 330 and 787 in J and F respectfully. F only operates on Oman Air for the bkk segment. This was booked in January.  


After a few weeks, Etihad changed planes and I was rebooked to an Oman Air to MCT and Turkish narrow body on the outbound to IST. And a few days ago Oman apparently downgraded me to J. Air Canada called and said I'd need to request a refund after traveling (of just 20k points I paid extra for first.) The Oman Air return flights haven't changed at all, I simply lost my seat.  


1. Is there anything I can do here; I don't understand how I lost my confirmed seat? I wasn't under the impression it could just be revoked. I was looking forward to trying out the first class lounge in MCT in particular, which is only an option on the return since the IST leg has no first class cabin. I can't find first availability in this direction around my dates at all, which I am flexible about. Occasional outbound availability is there, but I'd only have biz lounge access then so it seems not worth spending the points on without getting the full experience.  

2. Most Etihad IST legs are on an a320 and it's easier for me to find a a300 and nice seat routing through muscat instead of Etihad via auh. Should I forego trying out Etihad and just look to Oman Air both ways in business? I'm under the impression Oman may be considered superior anyway at the moment?","lost my aeroplan booked oman air first class seat, what's the point of confirmation if it can be taken away anyway...?",,igobyplane_com,,0,2/25/2023 10:25

I'm trying to book a late March flight (SF to NYC), my flight dates are inflexible (3/26-3/31). I'm fine flying economy and taking overnight flights. I'd rather not have the total travel time (flight + layovers) exceed 7 hours.

I have Southwest points (\~15k) and Capital 1 travel points (\~60k).

I've noticed that the X/Saver fare for the dates I'm looking at now are unavailable, but it looks like United may release X fares closer to the travel date.

awardtravel,"I'm planning our honeymoon travel (yay!) and have decided to pursue Emirates F on the JFK-MXP route for spring 2024. Our plans are totally flexibile, I've mostly settled on this because Emirates product/service is legendary, we live in the souteast US so getting to JFK is very easy (and we have friends there so we could position whenever we want comfortably), and finally I only have Chase UR points and this seems to one of the best flights I can get with the least connections.

Looking at availability now there are quite a few dates with F availability...but only 1 seat. Searching for 2 causes the award search to dump us to Business class.

My research has shown that Emirates doesn't seem to consistently release award availability so there is no guarantee even if booked the day it opened up I'd actually have a chance of getting two seats.

My plan so far is: if there is only a single F seat for my desired date when it opens up, I will book that F seat and book a J seat. I intend to do this as one-way. We intended to be away for 2-4 weeks, I don't want to wait 4 weeks for the availability on the return flight to open up (even if it costs more miles to do this).

I've learned that Emirates offers an auto-upgrade option but it seems to rarely fire. Hopefully this will magically get P2 into First class, but I'm not going to bank on it. It isn't clear to me if this is because auto-upgrade doesn't work properly (meaning seats _are_ available to book, the system just doesn't work) or if it's because seats aren't released.

If that doesn't happen I intend to ask to be upgraded at the counter, and then at the gate, and then in the plane.

This seems to be what others have done; my main issue is that we like to fly seated together on these long flights. We think we'd both rather be in J than one in first/one in J. My fear is business filling up and then we are stuck apart.

Some questions:

How likely is it that J will fill up and we'll get stuck apart? Is there a way to keep an eye on business availability to make sure this doesn't happen?

Are there any things in this plan I haven't considered that might be better way to get that second F seat? I've seen reference to third-party tools for monitoring availability but I've never used one; any recommendations on a tool to help monitor for availability in this way?

awardtravel,"I booked an American Airlines reservation with three tickets for Thanksgiving weekend 2022 with UR points via the Chase Travel Portal. Tickets were over $600pp, almost $2K in total- and we ended up having to cancel at the last minute bc of Covid.

When I canceled, Chase Travel told me that when I was ready to re-book, it needed to be done over the phone. I confirmed the value of the credit (\~$2000) at that time. 

I called them today trying to book new flights on AA, hoping to use our flight credit from the canceled reservation.  The AA website, google flights, and a chase travel portal search all show a price of  about $350 per ticket- I was planning to just forfeit the fare difference from my more expensive itinerary and just eat that cost. 

The first person I spoke with told me they were just getting ""errors"" trying to book and passed me up to a Supervisor. The Supervisor said that, per AA policy, they're only allowed to use a credit to book a flight of ""equal or greater"" value. They were quoting me $800pp and asking me to pay an additional $500ish to make the change! I have no idea where this ticket value came as its almost triple what's showing on the AA website and other travel sites.

I'm super frustrated- I've never heard of this rule before.  I can't find it in the fine print anywhere. I've used flight credits to book tickets with AA  before- I understand that it can only be used for the same ticketed passenger, that I need to eat any fare difference with a cheaper flight, etc, but never that I could only use a credit from a canceled flight to book a more expensive ticket. WTF?

Has anyone run into this before? Any idea how to argue my case? Do I just keep calling Chase and hope to find the agent that can actually help me? I have definitely learned my lesson on booking travel directly through Chase :(",Using an AA flight credit on Chase Travel Portal?,,mccarton87,,0,2/23/2023 4:54

awardtravel,"Hey everyone, I'm a pretty new member to this sub but from what I've gathered it seems like finding F and J flights to Japan are incredibly hard, so I'm wondering if I should just settle for Y and how to use my points efficiently.

I have about 100k UR points to spend and I'm hoping to go in September from LAX with my SO, RT. I'm unable to find any F seats via United's search tool but there are some J seats for around ~$5,000 and Y for ~$900. If I wanted to book J, is it still correct to call VS and confirm availability of the seats and then transfer my points from UR to VS, then call again at a later point to book that flight? I'm also unsure of how exactly the dollar amounts relate to the number of points it costs - I'm assuming this is where the award chart comes into play with a fixed cost for each seat class?

Lastly, if I wanted to book 2 J seats but only have 100k points, would I be able to somehow pay for the remaining 80k in cash or is it restricted to ONLY points?

we booked 4 economy flights with Air France with a transfer from Amex points in July, over Bastille day (I didn't know it at the time, sounds cool!).   


we are repositioning to Chicago to make that flight. We initially booked a Nonrefundable, cheap, non-stop flight with American Airlines that would have worked for times, but now will not. Lesson learned.   


Rebooked a delta connecting flight that arrives in time the day of with 5 hours to spare for our departure flight with Air France. the flight home is the day after. Wish it was a day before departure, but couldn't make that work.   


Used a delta companion certificate to book first class for my son and I. Used points to book first class for my underage daughter and wife. We're on the same flights but with different reservations.   


We booked my son and my flights together and round trip due to the companion cert. wife and daughter were booked one way, both ways.   


We ALSO booked a separate return flight for the wife and daughter with points. It turns out that we come back to Chicago from France a few days before my wife and daughter need to be in Chicago again for an event. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thought being that we'd cancel whichever one they didn't use, and get the points back. So essentially they have a ticket to Chicago, and two tickets from Chicago.   


I've read that you should link your tickets together so airlines will keep you together, and help keep things in order for your family while traveling. Should we do so? Is having two return flights going to throw up a red flag for something? Can I even link the Delta / Air France flights since they are partners?

Possibly could do a cheaper repositioning flight to West Coast if that will make it significantly cheaper/more feasible. The issue is I don't have a ton of time off to work with so that may not be a totally viable option.

Hello,

Will be staying in Osaka for 6 days as the middle part of a Tokyo-Osaka-back to Tokyo 2 week trip in late May. This is our first time visiting Japan. We are Hilton Diamond members so prefer to stay at a Hilton.

We will be using Osaka as a home base for day trips to Kyoto for at least 2 of those 6 days. Was debating the Hilton ($240 a night or 65k points per night) vs Conrad ($580 or 95k points per night). Both are 5 star hotels but Conrad is considerably nicer. Was wondering if the Conrad is worth the splurge. My concern is how much time we will actually be in the hotel to enjoy. We are big foodies and will be relying on the hotel concierge for restaurant reservations and wondering if the nicer Conrad would make a difference with regards to the concierge service as well. Considering this is our first time in Japan we imagine ourselves to be out and about most of the day. I heard Hilton is better located for public transport?

awardtravel," Hi all   
TLDR: Redeemed 17.9 cpp using VS sweet spot with ANA. 

Long time lurker here and since everyone and their mom trying to go to Japan, the popularity of VS sweet spot, and the fact VS joining Sky Team soon makes me feel so lucky to snatch this deal. Little concern about VS joining SkyTeam soon but fingers crossed nonetheless.  


So here’s my story: Started my points game when I started college (just graduated), able to accumulate 110k MR, and 270k UR. Initially just thought gonna use points to book RT in Y for wherever I want to go, but then read about points value and realize the experience is amazing, and leveraging points by using them to buy J/F tickets is a better use of points.  Initially thought about going to Europe, was able to find 147k + $180 SFO - IST - FCO, CDG - SFO for November this year. But S/o wants to go to Japan/Korea more and I’m still missing some points to book 2 tickets in J. So more lurking and found the VS sweet spot to Japan. I read through every post on this sub about ANA and VS, and was considering open another amex to book 2 RT in J with ANA if I can’t use VS. I read through a bunch, as well as the podcast.  At this point, I know that Amex points transfer can take 1-2 days and Chase can be instant, and I need to find a seat/or 2 + have the points ready. 

I signed up for expertflyer, was able to get the trial period and search for any ticket to TYO from SFO as practice (we want to go in April/March or November). This is where the magic happened, I have a friend who has a travel agency business as his side gig. So I asked him which option should I go for (VS sweet spot, direct with ANA) and we talked and he compare the values of points across the board. At one point, we considered buying life miles to offset the ANA surcharge. And he told me to consider other months for better availability, cause April might be harder compared to February for example. 

While practising we stumbled upon 1 F in ORD. Although we are able to see it on Expert Flyer, I couldn’t book it yet, VS only see 331 days out. 2 more days until I can book it. I trust my guts and transfer all my amex points early. Right after I transfer the seat disappeared, words can't describe my feeling at that moment.  However, I keep checking it, and the next day it pop up again, another good news for me was my Amex points were already posted on my VS account. So I immediately called VS to try to book it, but they couldn't (what a LOL moment, I called around 5 pm pst and they said they can't see that far out yet, the system reset 7am UK time - which is 11 pm PST). I didn't believe that and would check on them every few hours, 4 times to be exact, at one point the call agent recognize me and confirm it to try again around 11 pm (a little bit of a shame but for that F seat it's bearable lol). 11:01 pm I immediately called and was connected after 2 mins. The morning shift agent confirm they can see the date I want just now and was able to check for the seat. Found it still available, and confirm the booking, paid 60k points + $360. My seat is done there,  still need to find my S/O seat, preferably outbound from SFO cause she didn't want to reposition. A day later, while on the phone with my S/O checked the same flight again and see a J spot open up. Immediately called VS and booked, this time it was so much easier.   


Now we need to find an inbound from TYO - SFO (finger cross). Overall, it was a dreadful experience but the joy after was really amazing.  And yes the dilemma between 2 J sitting together and 1 J, 1 F was discussed between me and my partner beforehand. She told me that it would be an amazing experience and she doesn't want me to miss it for the world (we are both in our early 20s so this is our first time flying in J/F).   


All in all, got 17.9cpp using my Amex card, could not be happier. :) Thank you for listening to my wall of text, if there are any tips about booking that inbound flight to SFO please let me know.",Booking Confirmed! We are going to Japan for the first time in J/F!,,SurvivorBayArea,,1,2/21/2023 9:21

awardtravel,"I'm looking to book a Lufthansa flight via Air Canada Aeroplan. Air Canada has a ""Standard Reward"" fare and a ""Latitude Reward"" fare, neither of which say whether/not I'd receive free seat selection or a checked bag on the Lufthansa flight. Lufthansa has an Economy Light fare which does not allow for seat selection or a checked bag, and Economy Classic/Green/Flex fares which do allow for seat selection and a checked bag. *Does anyone know how Air Canada fares translate to Lufthansa fares (i.e. Air Canada Standard Reward = Lufthansa Economy Classic, Air Canada Latitude Reward = Lufthansa Economy Flex)?*

\---

Below is what was going to be my original post, but I seemed to answer my other questions as I wrote this up. The only question I have is above.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to book a Lufthansa flight from CDG to BER. The flight is in Sep 2023, and I'm not confident about my other travel plans for the trip, so I'm really looking for flexibility in changes &amp; refunds.

&amp;#x200B;

When booking directly via Lufthansa, the cash price is

* the Economy Classic fare is 150.62 EUR (164.38 USD)
   * includes free seat selection, 1 carry-on, 1 checked bag
   * charges 35 EUR for changes
   * doesn't allow for refunds
* the Economy Green fare is 194.62 EUR (212.40 USD)
   * also includes free seat selection, 1 carry-on, 1 checked bag
   * free changes (just pay the fare difference)
   * again, no refunds
   * to me, the Economy Classic fare is better because the difference between the Green and the Classic fare is 44 EUR, which is more than the 35 EUR change fee (if I change the flight, I  expect to do so just once)
* the Economy Flex fare is also 194.62 EUR (212.40 USD)
   * again, free seat selection &amp; bags
   * free changes (just pay the fare difference)
   * refundable except 70 EUR

&amp;#x200B;

If I book this flight as an award ticket via Air Canada Aeroplan

* the Standard Reward fare is 7.5k miles + 119 CAD (89.27 USD)
   * for the seat selection &amp; checked bags, it says to contact Lufthansa regarding their policies. *Does anyone know what Lufthansa allows for in this case?* I called two different agents at Lufthansa, and neither of them could answer my question without a booking reference number.
   * charges a fee allows for changes or refunds for a fee -- it doesn't say how much though. [This Air Canada page](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/book/fare-options-and-fees/to-international-destinations.html#/) just vaguely states ""A fee applies"" for the Any-time change.
* the Latitude Reward fare is 20.5k miles + 119 CAD (89.27 USD), and
   * same issue with the seat selection &amp; checked bag
   * changes are free (just pay the fare difference)
   * refunds are free
   * I don't really consider the 13k mile difference to be worth free changes &amp; refunds -- I would likely just book this for the flexibility and then when my plans are finalized, cancel these tickets and book the Standard Reward ones

&amp;#x200B;

If I book this flight as an award ticket via United MileagePlus

* the Economy Saver Award price is 16.5k miles + 59.50 USD. when trying to book this itinerary
   * the seat selection is not yet available -- it says it's free after completing the purchase
   * it says 1 free checked bag (but nothing about a carry-on bag -- I would assume that's free as well)
   * says the refund/cancellation policy is free before 31 days from departure, otherwise costs 125 USD.",Booking Lufthansa flight via Air Canada Aeroplan,,thewaterofmelon,,0,2/20/2023 21:15

I've done point redemptions in the past but only on AA and not used to booking another person nor transferring from AMEX nor all the other options.

To start with:

**Dates**:

2 weeks, anytime in July to early August

**Points balances**:

84,000 AA miles (I'd need to do either points + cash, or buy points since this isn't enough to 2 people in business)

700,000 AMEX MR (soon to be about 875,000 when I'm done with a Biz Plat SUB and Rakuten spend)

**Departure airports**

JFK, LGA, or EWR

Could also do PHL for a great redemption but would rather stay in NYC.

**Destination**

Naples, Rome, or Milan.  GF wants to do Amalfi coast so Naples would be ideal.  Not opposed though to flying in to Milan and taking the train or road trip down to Naples and out of Rome or Naples.  Or vis-a-versa.

**Airline status**

None

**Bookings found**
 
_Option 1 departure_

*  Air France
* Business class
* JFK to FCO with a stop in CDG
* 777-300
* 124,000 miles total for 2, one way
* $489 in fees
* Thursday departure

_Option 2 departure_

* Emirates
* Business class
* JFK to MXP, nonstop
* A380-800
* 174,000 miles total for 2, one way
* $208 in fees
* Friday departure

_Return flight_

* Air Europa
* Business class
* FCO to MAD (737) to JFK (787-8)
* 182,000 miles total for 2, one way
* $82 in fees
* Saturday departure

Is it worth it for 50k extra miles to fly Emirates over Air France?  I have plenty of miles and no real plans for the rest of them.  Maybe a trip to South Korea/SEA next summer and fingers crossed a honeymoon somewhere in the next few years.

I've never been out of the country and I'm 43 and will be working the rest of my life, so this really is my best shot.

So I have about 300,000 miles on my United account, I am Premier 1K, and have 320 Plus Points. I am trying to do international flight for 4 people from IAH to Italy end of June (any airport would work, but I have chosen Rome). I am finding a few flights that have like ""award saver"" at 33K miles one way, so that is about 264,000 miles. Ok so the trip is virtually free other than the $300 or so I have to pay in taxes etc.

Now supposedly there is a way to search flights that can use PPs to try to get polaris seats sooner than later.  For international flights I think it's 40PP per one way per person right?  So theoretically I could use all 320 of my points on this one trip and be first class the whole way if they clear. No matter how I try I am not able to see which flights will clear, or have the best option to clear or can possibly book upgrade on booking.  Ideally I would pretty much use most of my miles and all my PPs, because I am going to hit 1K again this year so will re-up on PPs probably around August or Sept.

So my question really is how can I search for flights that will have a better chance to get upgraded earlier for the most legs and use basically all points for the flights?  Like I said I have found many flight combinations that will use my miles at either 30K or 33K per one way for Economy class.

3.) is traveling 30 hours give or take at 4.5 months pregnant…. That bad?
4.) cancellation policies - Hyatt is easy to work with, but any advice on airlines? Just worried something may come up with the pregnancy 

And yes, it’s our first kid. Lol. Also, it isn’t necessarily a once in a lifetime trip or anything - I’m going to run 600-700k through my credit card in the next year, so getting points for vacations is easy enough, it just seems a lot more daunting with a young kid.

awardtravel,"I'm a United flyer and currently Platinum. I'm likely to requalify for Platinum again this year with an outside shot at making 1K. I'm based in a UA hub so for virtually any destination I can fly nonstop, I will fly UA. (IF United doesn't fly nonstop and I have a connection anyway, I'd consider other airlines. And of course others have flights out of the UA hub as well, but just not as many flights). 

My question is, if I got the Aeroplan credit card, is there an argument to credit these flights to AC? Air Canada's website says that you qualify for status with a combination of miles and dollars. As to dollars, it says:

Earn SQD on eligible flights operated by Air Canada, Air Canada Express and Air Canada RougeTM

Earn SQD on flights with Star AllianceTM member airlines ticketed on Air Canada ticket stock (ticket numbers beginning with “014”

That makes it sound like a ticket issued by United (016) but credited to AC would not earn SQDs? On a different page, it says:

*Earn Aeroplan points on all eligible United Airlines flights, as well as Status Qualifying Miles and a Status Qualifying Segment that count towards Aeroplan Elite Status. Status Qualifying Dollars are earned on United Airlines flights ticketed by Air Canada""

Air Canada cannot sella ticket wholly within the USA. So, am I right that there's no option to earn AC status solely by flying USA domestic flights on UA?

My ideal departure days would be July 16-18 to 29-31. I'm flexible flying from SFO, LAX or SEA

For Cathay Pacific, their award chart is based on distance. If I fly from SEA, I have to fly the OTHER way around the world to Doha via QR metal which is 47,000 miles one-way. If I fly from SFO, I fly to HKG via CX metal which totals to 42,000 miles economy one-way. All other award classes are unavailable. I've tried checking the Asia miles website, but it keeps redirecting me to Cathay Pacific's website. Booking with cash totals to $1960.

Or is it just 67.6 cpp &amp; 23.8/21.6 cpp for SQ and 42.9 cpp for CX? I save more money booking CX, but get more value out of SQ??

I wanted to ask possibly a beginner-level question, but I've always been curious. I booked an economy class flight from SFO to DXB on Emirates with the hopes that I could upgrade to business with miles and avoid the additional \~$400 fee. Unfortunately, I was stuck with the ""auto-upgrade"" option, which didn't work. 48 hours before departure, the business class cabin had 14 open seats on ExpertFlyer (A380, 76-seat config).

The flight is now about 13 hours away, and the business class cabin is completely full. 

Does this happen because people are upgrading with cash? Buying last-minute tickets? Auto-upgraders with higher tier status with Emirates are getting upgrades filled first? My main question is, how does this happen?

Anyways, I have done a ton of research on Emirates' upgrade process... The first-class cabin still has 9 seats open. I'm hopeful that at least 2 people will upgrade from business class to first class at the airport, and hopefully, I can put in a request to snag 2 business class seats by being at the airport when check-in opens.

 Before I transfer enough point to Asia Miles, I'm hoping to get some feedback that I'm not overlooking anything major.    Are there any other airlines that I should consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello award travel redditors! First post here so I'm a noob in this reward point space but need some help.

My wife and I have recently been using our CC for business related purchases and had no idea how quickly we would rack up points. Within a single year, we now have 1M Ultimate Reward Points and have no idea what to do with them. 

Normally we would just sit on something like this and wait until we had an urge to go somewhere and then try to leverage the points the best we could in that moment. The issue arises in that it seems like points are a depreciating asset and we will likely have this amount of points recur at a frequency of 1M per 1-1.5 years. The recurring nature of our points and the risk of them depreciating leads us to believe we need to use them.

To round everything out for our situation, both my wife and I are working professionals with demanding careers with limited time off throughout the year so 2 weeks is really the max amount of time we can take with 3 weeks being on the table, but that would take some convincing on both our ends to put work down continuously for that long. We live in the CA Bay Area if that helps for the discussion, meaning we would need to leave out of SFO, SJC, or OAK.

So that leaves me with this question, if you were to blow 1M points on a single trip for two people given time to plan and try to maximize a trip's value, what would you do with these points? 

As a place to start, bucket list items for us are Italy/Mediterranean, Japan, some form of a Australia/Polynesian trip. We are open to go other places as well, both of us love adventure and travelling but those three are the things we have talked about recently.  We are also not necessarily in a rush so we could give booking a trip some time in order to maximize value.

awardtravel,"**TL;DR** IAD-IST-TLV-MAD-ORD in J (TLV-MAD is in Y) for 2 for **230k UR/MR + $569** in fees. 2 weeks in Israel/Palestine/Jordan.

**Intro:**

Yesterday, I booked a 2 week trip to Israel/Palestine/Jordan for 2, mostly in J, for January 13-27, 2024. I got a $12 one month membership to [point.me](https://point.me) to help with the booking. It was my second time using it, first time was a few months ago to book a Europe trip (I'll make a trip report on that when I return from it in June). It more or less did what I needed it to but there was one wrinkle that I'll talk about later that's worth mentioning.

**Planning:**

We were flexible on dates but I wanted to fly out and return on a Saturday and straddle a federal holiday to minimize the amount of vacation time I would have to take. We're still in the early stages of planning the actual itinerary, but we're wanting to see Petra, Wadi Rum, the Dead Sea, Jerusalem, Ein Gedi, Ramallah, and Rosh HaNikra.

**Flights:**

Between my wife and I, we had 97k MR that we wanted to burn through before going into our stack of UR. We have the SW CP and wanted to use that for repositioning (if necessary) from ATL.

To get there, we'll be flying IAD-IST-TLV on Turkish Airlines in J, booked through Air Canada. Access to the excellent IAD and IST Turkish lounges was a big selling point, as was the quality of the J product. For the two of us, that was a total of 140k UR/MR plus $123 in fees. That booking was painless and we found lots of availability that far out out of multiple airports.

We briefly considered using the program where if you fly Turkish J from the US and back with Istanbul as a stopover both ways, [they'll put you up in a 5 star hotel in Istanbul for free for 3 nights](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights/stopover/), but ultimately decided we wanted two full weeks at our destination. Will definitely keep that in mind for the future (an Oman trip is something we want to do in the next 3-5 years).

On the way back, we'll fly TLV-MAD-ORD on Iberia, booked though British Airways (more on this later). The TLV-MAD flight is in Y and the MAD-ORD is in J, which will give us lounge access in Madrid. For the two of us, that was a total of 90k UR/MR plus $446 in fees (the Y leg was 22k if you want to know the breakdown). This was a pain to book, which I'll discuss in the next section.

**Struggles:**

[Point.me](https://Point.me) showed the return itinerary as the 90k plus fee price we ended up paying, but it showed that it was supposed to be booked through Iberia. I went to the Iberia site (the interface is not good) and found the flights... but they were 100k plus fees.

That wasn't a big deal to me so I went to the Amex site to transfer the points, but the site was down for maintenance (this was late Saturday night). I went to bed and figured I'd try again in the morning.

I went to the Amex site the next morning... and there was a red exclamation mark next to Iberia, saying transfers to Iberia were currently unavailable (just checked and it still says this). I went looking for a workaround, found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/10hhh78/how_to_transfer_amex_points_to_new_iberia_air_jan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) post and got working. Long story short, that didn't work. I tried absolutely everything I could and wasted a couple hours trying to transfer Aer Lingus avios to Iberia (I was ultimately able to transfer the 1k test avios to British Airways though).

Right when all hope seemed lost, I had a eureka moment. Went to British Airways' site and, sure enough, found the same Iberia itinerary for the 90k+fee cost that was showing on [point.me](https://point.me). After adding P2 as an AU on my CSP, I was able to transfer UR to her British Airways account to finish the booking.

awardtravel,"Hi, Looking for advice on award booking mechanics on partner awards on American Airlines.  I have a close-in flight on JAL that departs in two weeks, that I've snagged two tickets (me and gf are travelling together) in business (60k pts ea).    This was booked in one itinerary/confirmation number on AA.

However, I see that either JAL/AA released one first class ticket at 80k at JAL on the exact same flight.  I tried changing the ticket on AA but the website says cannot change partner award flights.

Ideal goal is for both of us to fly in Biz.  However, I'm not sure how to work the booking mechanics to ensure I don't lose the biz seats and get stuck with no seat to get home (aside for paying really expensive cash one way economy tickets)I initially I was thinking this way to be safe:

1. Book for me and 2P on separate tickets for 1 biz and 1 First class.  Both are available on the same flight, and I have enough extra point to cover it (60k+80k = 140k(.
2. Cancel the original itinerary with both of us pretty much immediately right after.
3. Keep hoping the 2nd first class seat opens up close in, and repeat this process (ie, book 1 persons first class award, cancel the coresponding biz ward)

I'm uncertain about duplicate booking rules, some blogs suggest that AA will autocancel on you and it may not be the one you want cancelled! [https://www.johnnyjet.com/duplicate-reservations-american-airlines/](https://www.johnnyjet.com/duplicate-reservations-american-airlines/)

Or the alternative is:

1. Cancel original itinerary with both of us
2. Book for me and 2p on separate tickets for 1 biz and 1 first class.
3. Keep hoping the 2nd first class seat opens up close in, and repeat this process (ie, cancel 1 persons biz class award, book the 1st class award)

However, the downside is that there is a small risk of the tickets disappearing right out of under me, in the time between, right?

Also, I'm uncertain how fast AA refunds miles on cancelled flights, but I think it should be instant (let me know if its not)

LMK thoughts on how to manage this safely.

Also lastly any advice on how to check to see if there's any first class seats left at all would be appreciated - for example if we know there's little chance at all there's two that may free up since it's been all sold for cash fare that would be useful.",American Airlines Award Rebooking Mechanics,,cyborgcanuck,,0,2/13/2023 6:46
awardtravel,"Hi, I’m hoping to plan a trip from SFO to various cities in Western Europe in early June. I’m somewhat flexible in terms of dates but generally am aiming to leave in the first week of June and return after 2-2.5 weeks.

awardtravel,"I wanted to share my points.me concierge experience.  I heard about this service through various subs and decided to give it a go.  I accumulated over 400k in Chase Ultimate Rewards (UR) and decided to use it for an epic birthday trip for my wife and I.  Being relatively new to the rewards game, my goal was to find the best redemption.  The concierge service is $200 per person so in total the service was $400.  With such high initial investment I had high expectations and would say it was met.   

After filling the inquiry form on the website with trip details and paying the non-refundable $25 deposit, I was matched with James.  I mentioned to James that I was based out of Honolulu, Hawaii and worked in the airline industry so I was looking to fly out of either LAX, SFO, or JFK.  My intent was non-rev out of HNL to a larger hub then use rewards to fly business class to Paris.  My situation was unique in the sense we were extremely flexible.  I let James know that we were looking for roughly about 10 days overall and wanted the trip to occur in early September ideally for my wife’s birthday.  

The thing I liked most about the service was the smooth communication.  During this process, I was actually on vacation with my wife in Japan and we were able to quickly correspond via email between breaks.  I asked to look into doing a stopover in Cairo on our way over to Europe and James was able to accommodate this.  James actually recommended against this since it meant flying on Air Egypt which is inferior to other European carriers.  However, seeing the pyramids is a bucket list item for my wife so it was worth it.  Besides Paris and Cairo, James also recommended Munich for us as a fairly popular destination.

After settling on a redacted itinerary, I paid my balance of $375 for the services.  At which point, they provide the full itinerary with instructions for transferring the points and also help you with the bookings.

Having never booked an award flight, I was happy with the level of service I got for the concierge service.  I found the process to be really smooth and I was able to get the trip planned with minimal time investment on my part.  I surprised my wife with the trip as an early Valentine’s Day present and she couldn’t be any happier.  Now we’re actively looking at places to stay and things to do.

TL;DR I bought from Air France an international ticket on Virgin and Air France and Delta does not see it. I wanted to use my skymiles but couldn't, now I want to use them to upgrade. 


Hello, I am a gold medallion on Delta airlines with 235k skymiles and I live in Orlando Florida. I am going to Cairo Egypt in June for a wedding and wanted to stick with skyteam so I could use my skymiles. I found very expensive Air France/Virgin tickets through Delta (cash) and no option to buy my tickets with skymiles through Delta. I ended up buying economy tickets directly through Air France with the hope to use my skymiles to upgrade. A Google search assured me I would be able to use skymiles on both Virgin and Air France. I linked my skymiles account when I bought them and even verified with Air France that it was linked. I called Delta to get a quote and Delta cannot find my Virgin or Air France reservation or tickets. I gave them both the ticket number and the confirmation number. Virgin is doing my longest flight (9hrs) Air France is doing a 2 hr and a 5 hr flight. I humbly ask for your help I travel domestically and am a solid yearly gold medallion.

awardtravel,"I've been searching in anticipation of booking a flight for 2 adults and 1 lap infant in J sometime in the Spring for the Spring of 2024. What I'm finding is if I find 2 available partner seats on ANA I can book the 2 adults fine but if I select lap infant it doesn't allow me to see the availability. When I search for a last minute flight that has 3 or more seats then I can book with a lap infant selected. 

I think this is a technical limitation of the Aeroplan site where it shows 3 passengers in the search even though it's for 2 seats. Has anyone run into this? Is it easy enough to add a lap infant after you've booked the two seats either online or through calling in and paying the additional miles?

Hoping to get some feedback on this award redemption. Got a multicity ticket, booked via United for the listed itinerary for 178,500 United points (about 90,000 of these were transferred from Chase and rest were earned on United) 

The trip is— 
SDF-ORD-ZRH-DEL-JDH and coming back is JAI-BOM-DEL-ORD-SDF. 

The international travel from SDF-JDH is via business Swiss, and international part of JAI-SDF is business Air India. Some of the domestic flights are economy, that I don’t mind. 

Thoughts on whether this is a decent mileage redemption? I feel it’s a good deal from a points standpoint, but hoping for an outside view. Annoyed about not being able to earn PQP on this trip though, as well as the fact that I won’t be able to use Polaris lounge in ORD when coming back due to being on partner airline. 


Normally when booking travel between US-India, I book ORD to DEL/BOM (whichever is cheaper) Star Alliance business class. And then the other tickets between smaller cities on a separate round trip ticket.

I can get to BKK in Biz
I can stop in SIN for 10 hours and check out the city/airport.
I can actually find availability!!!

This flight is available on [united.com](https://united.com) for $3304 r/t, which includes base fare of $3012 and the balance in taxes/fees. That should mean I'd earn 3012 PQP if booked through [United.com](https://United.com)

[aircanada.com](https://aircanada.com) sells those flights for $2676, with the outbound in P class and the return in Z. According to [gcmap.com](https://gcmap.com), EWR-YVR is 2429 miles.

That means I'd earn 3643 base miles on the outbound and 4250 on the return.

PQP earnings on AC are base miles divided by 5 ([https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/mileageplus/earn-miles/airline-partners/premier-qualifying-credit.html](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/mileageplus/earn-miles/airline-partners/premier-qualifying-credit.html)).

So, I can earn roughly 3000 PQP for $3300 if I book through United, or 1578 PQP for $2676 if booked through [aircanada.com](https://aircanada.com)

Unsure if will have time to make use of an excursionist perk w/UA but on the other hand SKP seems very \*A dominant.  It's possible and flexible on where.  
Main issue is gonna be the TA flights it looks like

We have a lot of UR + MR...good amounts of DL, UA, AA

BIG IMPORTANT THING: if P2 gets a new job he might not go, so which options of these are the least painful to cancel just one person (or I guess we can book separate tickets?)

These feel like my main options:

PHL/EWR to \*A hub or OneWorld?  Any recommendations?  A small bit of searching on UA is not yielding much that's affordable, everything has billion connections?

EWR-ATH 5th freedom on EK, feels exciting, couple days in Athens could be dope.  Best way to book?  Prices went up, it's 174k each (87k one way) + $252.  Could be worse but could be better.  If I can see these flights, can I book elsewhere? such as.....

AA looks like it's 57.5k each way.  We have enough AA miles.  Would use cash ticket I guess from ATH-SKP?

Asiana is only 80k RT, is that for real?  We only have 100k Marriott tho, so would have to transfer something in.  Probably not into opening a Marriott card rn (had biz &lt;7 yr ago) IDK if worth it to transfer?  Transfer rates suuuuck from MR, UR. It's \*A so could do ATH-SKP as part of the ticket potentially.

awardtravel,"Hi there, I am feeling a bit stuck with travel plans and was hoping to get some assistance.

My partner and I had booked business class flights with KLM for our honeymoon (NYC-AMS-JRO and JRO-AMS-LAS) at what I thought was a decent price of 420K miles for the two of us. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to cancel the original plans which were set for March 2023 and now need to rebook for February 2024.

Our dates are flexible, but not extremely flexible, as we are set to start our Kilimanjaro climb on February 3, 2024. I now have the full 420K miles refunded to my Flying Blue account and cannot for the life of me find comparable pricing for this trip through KLM.

I checked the AwardHacker website and it seems more favorable to book with any airline but KLM to get to JRO. I am usually a MileagePlus loyalist but originally chose KLM given the ability to stay a couple days in Amsterdam before heading down to Tanzania, and having the comfort of two business class legs each way.

Award travel just got released for Feb 1st and the NYC-AMS-JRO flight is 398K miles for two and we no longer would have a couple days in Amsterdam like we originally planned.

I guess I'm wondering if I should just pull the trigger on rebooking with KLM given the exorbitant number of miles I have already transferred into the airline or pivot for a better deal elsewhere. We have about 250K-300K points between Amex and Chase that we can transfer elsewhere. I also can't tell if I should wait to see if the KLM flight drops more given their dynamic pricing model, or if I should book ASAP.

TL:DR: lots of points, but overall felt worth it for a special occasion. The best seat/bed combo I’ve had in the sky. The food was average to good but nothing special. Service was fantastic. 

We had seats 1/2F. I sat in 1F to FRA and then 2F to Singapore. Despite 1F being slightly bigger, I would pick row 2 every time. The TV in front of 1F was off and not able to be controlled by the iPad. So until we finished take-off (which took awhile bc of long taxi-big), I had to twist to watch the other screen. I didn’t feel like either seat had very good views out the windows while in the seat or bed. One thing I would note: If flying this route, try to sit in “A” (left side of plane) bc you will get to see Singapore lit up on your approach to Changi.

Lounge at NYC: virgin clubhouse. We were very excited for this, as this sub loves it. I would say this was the biggest disappointment. The lounge was rather dirty, and it felt in big need of an update. The food was good (when it came) but several times drinks or food would take 30+ minutes or just not show up at all. We had planned on taking showers but the water wouldn’t get past lukewarm.  Probably for the best, bc the showers really didn’t seem very clean. 

I found the seat Very comfortable. I really appreciated how it had slight rocking capability, which seemed to offset the turbulence a bit. The controls were pretty intuitive also.

Our biggest fear for this flight was the hot cabin. No need to worry. It was comfortably cold the whole time. Which leads me to the bed. I loved it! I can see people thinking it is a bit hard, but that was great for me. Pillows, sheets, blankets were all nice and soft. I slept 4 hrs on the first flight and about 5 hrs on the second. Generally, I have a real hard time getting any real sleep on planes, so this was a great result. Definitely the best sleep I’ve had on a plane. Landed in Singapore feeling refreshed, which is all I could ask for. 

Service was fantastic. Not overbearing but on it every time. Food was just OK. There were hits and misses. Seemed like the Asian inspired food was better overall. Of note, the book the cool items were my least favorite. Maybe stick with what they do everyday. 

In FRA we landed and I was escorted to first class lounge. Had an amazing hot shower and then headed back. (We arrived late so only had 50 minutes till boarding). Still plenty of time. 

Finally, they brought us an extra dessert and had “happy honeymoon” drawn in chocolate. Plus a stuffed bear couple. Was a nice touch.",SQ suites A380 review NYC-FRA-SIN,,amriser24,,0,2/8/2023 7:51

MR points- P1 254K, P2 -162k (an additional 170k after 4/1/23- waiting for SUB to hit)  
The earliest we would like to go is 10/18/23 and the latest is 11/20/23 (but we are flexible)and be gone for around 10 days. Ideally, we would like the tickets to be a bit flexible in terms of changing dates/cancelling in the event of an emergency (if that is even possible).

I had waitlisted for an award flight with EVA and just assumed I can cancel freely.  A month goes by and no word so I decided to book another flight and cancel the waitlist.

What actually happens, according to the EVA rep I just spoke to: 

- You're issued a ticket for the waitlist, points deducted, taxes paid. 
- If you cancel / refund before the flight (whether or not waitlist is confirmed), you need to pay $50 refund fee for the points and taxes refund. 
- If you don't cancel (even if you are NOT confirmed a seat by departure), you can use the ticket for up to a year from booking, but it has to be the same departure/destination.

Why in the world do I need to pay a fee for cancelling waitlist? According to them, I'm issued a ticket, and whether or not I get a seat doesn't matter. Cancelling that ticket incurs a fee.

Took a bit of back and forth with United to change my BKK - NRT - SFO - SEA return leg to BKK - NRT - ORD - SEA, with BKK - NRT in ANA's 787-10 and NRT - ORD in The Room. Unfortunately the experience was underwhelming, some pros and cons for me:

Pros

* The flight attendants were great as is the case on all my ANA flights.
* The food was amazing.
* The seat is very wide, a bit hard compared to other seats but I prefer it personally.
* The sliding door, although not full closing, made the seat feel very private.

Cons

* There was a lot of wear and tear. Scuff marks and dents to corners on the hard surfaces, and fraying and loose covering for the soft.
* My seat controls had multiple unresponsive buttons. Took a lot of trial and error to get the seat into different positions with the ones that did work.
* The seat seemed a bit short. I'm 5'11 and wasn't able to stretch out fully.
* There were crumbs on the seat and floor. This was the case for my seat as well as the seats in front, behind, and across the aisle from me.
* Meal service was surprisingly slow. Started 2 hours after take off and finished an hour after that.

Although the service was in general great, I was very surprised at the poor state of the seat. It looks like my plane was 14 years old, but I don't believe The Room has been around for that long. The other seats I've gotten to experience this trip were better (new 777 Polaris, EVA's 787-9, and ANA's 787-10). I don't know if this is an outlier, or if anyone else has had similar experiences with The Room.","ANA The Room, worth the hype?",,aloudasian,,0,2/5/2023 15:46

Also, wouldn't mind having a few things to do locally tourist wise.  Was not necessarily wanting to do 7 days at bonita Hyatt although the water slides will be awesome.  I also like that Hyatt doesn't allow non guests in to use water park.

awardtravel,"Yesterday I finished booking a RTW ticket that begins later this month and lasts a bit over two months. 

---
**The Route:**

SFO-FRA-LIS: *United, then Lufthansa for short haul - 5 hour layover FRA*

&gt;22 Day period which will include Paris, Lisbon/Porto, and Istanbul

IST-PRG: *Turkish Airlines*
&gt; 8 Day period which will include Prague, Copenhagen

CPH-BKK: *Thai Airlines*

&gt; ~35 day period which will include Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, TBD

BKK-ICN: *Thai Airlines*

&gt; 5 day period in Seoul

ICN-YVR-SFO: *Air Canada, United - 4 hour layover YVR*

All legs are in Business class with the exception of YVR-SFO, which is in Economy -- though I can see if space opens up later and change for free. 

---


**The Cost**: 125,000 ANA miles + 729$ in taxes and fees

* The mileage total in Greatcirclemapper is 21,350. Originally I had also planned to include Porto to Paris (OPO-ORY) but I had a charting error and it turned out that would push me above 22,000 miles, which would raise the mileage cost to 145,000. The agent was very helpful in calculating and removing that leg on request


* Of the 729$, about 500$ is carrier imposed surcharges in YQ/YR:
 * ~200$ for Thai Air CPH-BKK
 * ~100$ for Thai Air BKK-ICN
 * ~150$ for Air Canada ICN-YVR
 * ~50$ for Lufthansa FRA-LIS

* I could have reduced the cost by flying SAS and Asiana instead of Thai Air for those legs, but none existed. The surcharges would also have been way worse if I didn't have a UA leg transatlantic and an Air Canada leg transpacific

___ 

**The Booking**

First, there was a failed booking attempt using my brother's partner's expiring miles. I won't ramble too much about details but suffice to say while ANA are lax about verifying relationships, there are relationships they won't book for and this was a no-go. 

After that rough 3.5 hours on the phone (including 2 hours on hold) I initiated a transfer from Amex to my own ANA account. It took about 2.5 days, during which my preferred transpacific leg disappeared. I kind of expected it would though and had found backup options. 

After the transfer went through, I called and connected in maybe 20 minutes -- seems later in the day PST has lower hold times. The agent was very knowledgable and helpful and despite a small language gap the booking went through very smoothly, with me reading off dates and flight numbers. That agent reserved the flights, and the next day I got a call to complete payment for taxes and fees.

____
**Observations**:

*I've never been too interested in RTW tickets in the past as they often seemed to shoehorn in more continents/countries then the time alloted really needed. I have a lot of time to play with here so it felt like a far more appealing option. But still, I would caution against feeling like you need to book a RTW vs just efficiently booking other legs.

*I was surprised how constraining the 22,000 mileage band felt. I suspect that people not transversing the entire US, and people skipping Southeast Asia and just travelling to Japan/Korea are saving a lot of miles which they can use elsewhere. But I will have to end up buying a decent amount of flights

* One of the bigger booking restrictions is the max 3 stops in Europe -- I could have done far more than that if I had the mileage and had to use ground stops creatively as is.",ANA RTW booking report,,gamesst2,,0,2/5/2023 1:47

I am attempting to redeem 2 AirCanada Aeroplan 50k mile flight certificates (from the Chase Aeroplan card last year) to send 2 people from Boston to Calgary in September. When I go to book the flights in premium economy with the certificates, I am that by the website that there are not enough miles to cover the flights despite being within all of the parameters set by the certificates. I am able to make the booking for economy flights but for whatever reason, premium economy gives me an error message saying ""there are not enough Aeroplan points in your account to apply to this booking."" 1 roundtrip on these flights in premium economy is 44.9k miles, which is of course less than the max of 50k each. The certificate says it can apply towards any cabin so premium economy should not be an issue yet the certificate is only properly applied for when I attempt to book in economy. The economy ticket charges steep fees to pick a seat in advance which I think is absurd on an award ticket but that's a separate issue...

I've called Aeroplan's customer service line \~10 times and have not gotten through to a human once. I was on hold for over an hour on one of those calls before Aeroplan dropped me. I've DM'ed on Twitter and Facebook to no avail. Their customer service is simply horrendous. I'm at the point where I'll never use AirCanada again but in the meantime I want to use up these certificates.

awardtravel,"Hi folks, typically we use award travel bookings. This was a paid booking by a relative and I'm curious what experiences have been in biz class.

During this KLM flight, the seat next to them was apparently broken and not reclining fully as the passenger next to my relative discovered, and then called the cabin crew over for. This woke up my relative (it was a late night flight) and the crew then spent 1 hour trying to fix the issue before then moving the original passenger with another passenger - who turned out to be a KLM crew member on a personal flight or such, so they switched seats (meaning the KLM crew member was now in the broken seat)

Throughout the flight, the crew member and the cabin crew spoke for a few hours straight and would literally hang around next to the seat, so it was not so quiet as an area, even with headphones on. There was also a lot of bustling as a result, I guess it's just colleagues catching up

When the family member did manage to sleep, they were skipped over for a few things which I think is normal but they managed to flag down other cabin members to help them, though it appeared to be from the other side of the cabin (i.e. serving the other side of biz class) than the original assigned crewmember

I am asking this on behalf of the relative because while the skipped over when sleeping part makes sense, they were surprised by the service itself and the colleagues being around rather than going to a quieter area for cabin crew etc. We do not fly biz class ever as a family so we have no experience, but it was a onetime splurge for this older relative and it would be good to know if their expectations were too high in this regard for what to expect honestly, or is this normal for biz class?",Is this experience typical of international long haul biz-class with KLM's service?

I am helping my brother to book a ticket for April at the moment, and thought I would ask for this sub guidance. My dad has some miles with Asiana that is about to expire pretty soon, which I thought could be perfect if it could be used towards my brother’s ticket since my dad does not have any near future travel plans. The only problem is that my brother has traveled quite often before, but I guess he had never set up an account with Asiana or any other SA partners. My brother was about to make an account with Asiana and apply for family mileage plan to use my dad’s miles, but Asiana apparently has this policy:

If the boarding member’s remaining mileage is 0, family mileage cannot be added to or used through the boarding member’s own account. Instead, a family member account can be used to issue a mileage ticket in the name of the boarding member (however, branch office visit is required.)

Does this mean that if my dad visits a branch office, they can issue a BP with my brother’s name? We just looked and see if we can buy a few Asiana miles too (for example I know I can buy United miles by paying them), and it seems like there is no way I can buy their miles like for example UA. Can he maybe make an account at UA, buy some miles, then transfer them?

I have \~115k Avios left to use, and my wife has \~130k left, so trying to fly back BA business class would be out of the question as that would be 190k Avios for each ticket.

awardtravel,"OK, phantom availability happens. We all hate it, but we get it. I warn clients about it. Some airlines are prone to listing phantom inventory (TAP, LOT for example) so I know to be suspicious and call to check. However, it's incredibly rare (to the point I've actually never seen this) where phantom inventory occurs when booking flights on an airline in their own program. That is, until tonight with KrisFlyer.

KrisFlyer is currently displaying inventory that is bookable. You can book it, get all the way to the end, submit payment data, etc. and then you'll get a notice that you were ""added to the waitlist."" Wait, what? Making matters worse, you aren't even actually waitlisted. You'll get a confirmation code with no booking attached.

I called Singapore, let them know what happened, submitted screen shot proof and they're going to escalate somehow and maybe decide to open up inventory. Hopefully it works out, but my client transferred 144k points out of Amex (which instantly posted, oddly enough!) and they're now stuck in KrisFlyer.

But my question is regarding miles you earn from flights. Do you create accounts on all airlines you fly and collect their miles? Or do you credit them to few specific airlines?

For example: In a few months I’m gonna fly with these airlines: Lufthanse, Qatar, Aegean Air, United/Delta, Air France. This is going to be more than a month long international trip visiting multiple continents.

So my question is what is the best way to accumulate all miles so that I can redeem them in a big trip later on. I have accounts on United, Lufthansa and Qatar. For Aegean, I was able to enter my United Travel number so hopefully it gets credited back to United.

What about Air France? Should I create an account there to collect those miles? Or look for a partner airline that I already have an account? Or should I only pick and choose a few airlines and only fly them?

awardtravel,"This is an update on [my 4-year-old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/bpb0ra/award_flights_to_new_zealand_booking_experience/) about booking flights to New Zealand and Australia. Even if you read this post 4 years after I write it, much will still be relevant.

The beginning is more of a listing of the flights. I have removed the frequency of flights and the exact time frame because they change frequently. [Flightconnections.com](https://Flightconnections.com) is a great resource to find this information currently. Post-pandemic closures we have seen some changes and I would not be surprised to see more.

The second part is more of a quick go-through of programs that are the most common to book through. The third part is more strategy in getting award seats, even if there doesn't appear to be space initially. 

This was initially written mainly focusing on New Zealand, I have made it more inclusive of New Zealand and Australia.

(This post was updated on and off over a few months, there will likely be some inaccuracies) 

# Nonstop

**Air Canada (AC):** Nonstop YVR-AKL. I have seen schedule opening space for this flight more frequently than AA/UA, than algorithmic space. Keep in mind AC opens up space \~12 months out, not \~11 months out like UA. \[YVR-LAX and YVR-BNE\]

**Air New Zealand (NZ):** This space is hard to come by in J. A little easier in Y. The best way to look for space is an Expert Flyer alert since availability tends to be random if it opens up at all. When they do open up seats, it tends to be a lot at once. More off-season space is released. YVR, SFO, LAX, IAH, ORD, HNL.

**American (AA)**Algorithmic release of award space (sometimes space when the schedule opens, but rare). They switched their seasonal service from LAX-AKL to DFW-AKL.  I have seen a lot of married segment logic on this route. PHX is a good city to use if you are looking for a default city that shows most married segment logic. DFW. \[Just started flying LAX-SYD in 10/22; strong codeshare agreements with Qantas have made AA previously not fly to Australia\]

**Delta (DL):** Delta will fly LAX-AKL for the first time starting 10/23. This flight was just announced 1/23, and who knows what the award space will look like. DL does fly LAX-SYD and periodically does release partner space, and periodically does have reasonable redemptions on this route, but it is not the norm \[LAX-SYD\]

**Qantas (QF):** Qantas flies JFK-AKL currently. They fly DFW-SYD, DFW-MEL, YVR-SYD, SFO-SYD, LAX-MEL, LAX-SYD, LAX-BNE, SYD-HNL. Qantas is GREAT at releasing premium cabins on USA flights, but there is a catch. Qantas Gold, Platinum, and Platinum One status members can book this space 353 days out at midnight GMT. Silver status members can book 323 days out. Any remaining seats are then released to partners and Bronze members at midnight GMT 297 days out. SYD-HNL is the one USA route that rarely gets premium cabin award space at schedule opening.

**United (UA):** They do open up J space algorithmically on this route, but rarely is it released on schedule opening. I have seen 8+ J seats available, but this is an exception, not the rule. Do not expect saver availability around Christmas. I have seen J space released to partners. They have learned people will pay the default 200K mile cost, which has reduced the number of should and high season seats released. SFO-AKL. \[They do release more award seats to Australia, IAH-SYD, LAX-MEL, LAX-SYD, SFO-SYD, SFO-BNE\]

# Connections

Three main regions are used for connections to New Zealand: Australia, South Pacific, and Asia. Not all programs allow you to connect through all the regions.

Almost all allow you to connect through Australia. If you are connecting through Australia on NZ a320/a321s they are a one cabin aircraft and do not have J (772, 773, and 787 do have J).

A fourth area for connections is the Middle East with Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad. These flights often cannot be booked by partners with through zone-based award charts as a single award.

ANA at times has limited award tickets to Australia and there are some flights with 0-1 premium cabin seats released at schedule opening.

# Booking Through Award Programs

Now that we have talked about the flights, this will talk about booking the flights listed above.

**American Airlines (AA):** Their routing rules allow you to connect through the South Pacific and Australia to New Zealand, but not through Asia. AA is a pain to search for since they often show a domestic F flight and a TPAC economy flight as a J award.

Direct: Flying the seasonal AA LAX-SFO routeAustralia: Flying AA or Qantas to Australia and then Qantas to AKL, WLG, CHC, or ZQN. Qantas flights between Australia and New Zealand can be booked 353 days out and don't follow the long-haul rules above.Air Tahiti: Decent availability has been showing in J without overnight connections when the schedule opens. Shows on AA’s website and flies to AKL.Fiji: Not the best product, and availability is hit or miss. Remember to search for flights to AKL, WLG, and CHC since sometimes availability isn’t available on the final leg to each destination.Qatar: This counts as two awards and is in the process of getting Qsuites.

**Aeroplan (AC):** Aeroplan does have access to Singapore's long-haul award space. They are also open to book ANA space \~schedule opening, they also have their direct flights. It is not always a cheap redemption, but they do have a lot of options that often release award space at a set time.

**ANA (NH):** This is the program that  is the easiest to find availability to New Zealand since they allow you to create your a routing with three connections. You have to fly TPAC, must book roundtrip, and are allowed one stopover. ANA’s search engine is pretty limited when searching, but you can use a multi-destination search to “force” your routing. ANA’s search engine typically does not include flights that connect from the US to ICN, TPE, PEK, or PVG on their searches. Remember to search for AKL, WLG, CHC, and ZQN. It can be time intensive to find an award, but I have never not been able to piece together a J award. Singapore opens up a decent amount of space on their AKL-SIN and WLG-SIN (regional product).

**Alaska (AS):** Alaska has a different award chart for each of their partners. You can mix Alaska flights with a partner, but you cannot use multiple partners on one ticket. You are allowed a stopover on a one-way award. This gives you more flexibility since your TPAC and flight to NZ can have availability on separate days.

**Avianca (AV):** I have seen a lot of restrictions on what routes you can book with Lifemiles to New Zealand. They tend to be more restrictive than UA and ANA, but I still have found availability with them. You generally cannot create your routing (there are DP of being able to email to get a routing, but this is highly YMMV in my experience). They do allow Asia connections.

**Cathay Pacific (CX):** You get additional award availability if you book directly. CX also does do a lot of married segment logic which does increase Oceania availability. AKL and CHC. MEL, BNE, SYD, PER, ADL.

**Delta (DL):** There are direct flights and partner flights. The rates on partner flights are traditionally expensive. They are partners with Virgin Australia, and you can connect through Australia. China Eastern (PVG), China Southern (CAN), Korean (ICN), and China Airlines (TPE-BNE-AKL) are Sky Team members that fly to AKL.

**Emirates (EK)**: Complaints of minimal award space to Australia. Again, not cheap, but can be useful in some cases.

**Fiji (FJ)**: Can be searched on AS. Availability is sometimes different than Expert Flyer. AKL, WLG, CHCQantas: Can be searched on AS. AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN

**JAL (JL):** JAL does offer access to Emirates rewards. They allow booking \~360 days out.

**Korean (KE)**: Must book roundtrip. Searchable on AS. Remember the price you see is roundtrip

**Qantas (QF):** The advantage of booking directly with Qantas is that you can book \~360 days out and they sometimes release availability at the start of the schedule for their US routes (if you have status). There is YQ, and the mileage amounts are typically higher than booking via AA.

**Qatar (QR)**: It is not cheap from the US, but an option.

**Singapore (SQ):** Partner award rates are very high, and UA, in most cases, would be a better option. If you want to fly SQ TPAC in a premium cabin, you almost always need to book directly through SQ since they basically never release those seats to partners (AC and AS do get availability). Starting in 2018, it does seem that there are releasing a lot more J space to partners from SIN-AKL/WLG/Australia. The SIN-BNE-WLG route is usually flown on a regional aircraft and often has good partner award availability.

**United (UA):** UA lets you route through Asia to get to New Zealand. The routes that they allow are highly variable and hard to figure out. I recommend searching for many US cities and AKL, WLG, CHC, ZQN. UA’s issues booking various Asian carriers' award space has reduced space connecting in Asia. You cannot piece together your own award. You can currently waitlist flights on UA metal and prepay for them (This is a holdover from the Continental days if I remember correctly, there must be Y award availability. You book the saver Y availability but pay the saver J price). I have had success on the AKL-SFO route with this clearing 48 hours before departure.

**Virgin Atlantic (VS):** Most of the talk with VS is about booking ANA to Japan. They have a great rate on NZ metal of 62.5k in J between the US and New Zealand (transfer bonuses put this between 48-55k). The issue is that this is the unicorn flight (unless you are flying May-August). There is award space released randomly, and Expert Flyer is your best bet. I have managed to book this award before. A good option for May-August when NZ released more space.

# Booking Strategy

I first decide what my optimal booking is. Do I want to fly CX, nonstop, stopover in Asia/Fiji? If I find availability one way, I will book it. I don't expect availability that I find today to be there tomorrow. I will then figure out the other direction (this has taken 6 months before).

**Want to Book in 11+ Months**

I monitor what award seats become at available at schedule opening with different airlines (this can change). I then figure out what airlines I am going to use to book the seats and make sure that I have miles there. I formulate a backup plan with miles on that airline if my primary option does not work for some reason.

**Schedule is Already Open**

This is where it can complicated. This is roughly the order that I go about looking for availability.

1. This is obvious. I start by searching flights from my airport to my destination airport looking for USA-Oceania routes without an Asia connection. If any TPAC to Asia flights pop up I note them.(Usually search AA, DL, UA, AF, regardless of having miles with them, using them to find availability).
   1. If I find partner-level availability I see if it can be optimized with partners.
2. I then alter my search to the cities that have direct flights.
3. I then search hub cities that do not have Oceania flights (example: search CLT/PHX/MIA/ORD with AA) to try to find married segment logic.
4. At this stage, I am confident that that is not direct USA-Oceania availability. I now search for programs that will have a connection. (AS, CX, SQ)
   1. This is where I will also search for availability with Middle East carriers if I am interested
5. If I have still not gotten a valid routing, I am now going to attempt to find availability that I can use to create my own routing with a program that allows it (AC\*, ANA, AA\*, CX)
   1. Search for any TPAC flight and then work on connecting it to Oceania
      1. I keep in mind if the program allows a stopover and I can find availability that lines up close, but is offset by a day or two
   2. If find one leg of TPAC I keep in mind programs that have unique routing rules like ANA ATW, Aeroplan ""Mini-ATW""\*, CX and sometimes look for TATL the other way.

**Booked a less than ideal itinerary or did not find one**

* Set Expert Flyer alerts for every non-stop nonstop flight that would work to your desired country. Space does become available randomly.
* If there is UA economy saver space, waitlist J via UA.

**Strategy Based on Number of Tickets Booking**

* Throughout the entire process, I keep in mind how many tickets I am trying to book.
* 1 ticket- Higher likelihood of NZ award seat becomes available. Higher likelihood of AA seat becoming available within 90 days. The expert flyer strategy is more likely to work.
* 2 tickets- Nonstop flights are still a possibility. NZ frequently only releases 1 J seat on many of their Asia routes at schedule opening. A very doable number.
* 3+ tickets- This gets tricky. I have seen UA release I9, which is at least 9 J award seats. This is not normal. The ANA route can be a little more difficult with 3+. The TPAC will be your most challenging flight, followed by the last flight to New Zealand, but there are frequently 3+ seats between New Zealand and Australia. UA waitlist on separate PNRs is a good backup if you can find saver Y.

# Wrap Up

I am 100% sure you can find some errors with this post. If this seems overwhelming keep in mind that 98% of people that book award flights to New Zealand/Australia do not do this entire process. I have booked 20+ New Zealand and Australia flights from the USA and have never not been able to get award flights (even when less flexible).  Saying that, getting flights around Christmas is very very difficult if not done at schedule opening. Some of the methods listed lead to very roundabout routings. I like to think of flying in J as part of the vacation/trip, vs simply a way to get from point A to B. Some people will think an itinerary with ANA, EVA, and Singapore premium cabin travel with an award ticket is fun, others wold rather pay cash for a direct Y economy ticket.

After reading all this, luck can also play a giant role.

awardtravel,"To set the scene, I’ve saved up about 90k AMEX points and I’m based in the Edinburgh UK. 

I’ve read and watched quite a few things online, and I’ve come to the conclusion that the best use of my points would be to transfer them to an airline as miles and then use for travel. 

While I agree that can probably get the most out of my points, I’ve struggled to find this in practice because of the reasons below:

1. High fees - on all the flights I’ve looked at, the fees are so high that I end up getting less £ per point than I would if I transferred them to Amazon vouchers (which I know is one of the worst exchanges for points). This might be made worse by the fact I’m in the UK which I understand may have higher fees.
2. Connecting flights - a lot of airlines won’t allow you to pay for connecting flights with points, or they’re treated as separate flights, increasing the points needed to a point where it’s not worth it. This is an issue for me as Edinburgh doesn’t do direct flights to many places outside Europe (NY at most, but that falls into problem 1)
3. Availability of reward flights - they never seem to line up with when I want to travel. I guess there’s no easy way around this and I just have to be flexible, but correct me if I’m wrong. 

I initially set out trying to use points to book a holiday I was already planning, but I realise now that might not be the best way to do so and rather let the best offer dictate when and where to go instead. I’m just not sure where to begin given the issues I outlined earlier. It’s not as if there’s a “best points deals from Edinburgh” tracker I can follow (or is there?).",I’ve saved up some points.

awardtravel,"My wife and I signed up for the Chase Sapphire Reserve card a few months ago, with dreams of accruing 10X points on all our reimbursed our work travel. I had a business trip, so I booked the hotel and rental car through Chase Ultimate Rewards. Here were all my issues:

* Enterprise's computer system apparently couldn't handle the booking correctly, and they tried to charge me an additional $1,000(!) per day for the car rental at the time of pickup. Luckily I read the size 4 font on the Enterprise tablet before I signed for the car! I had to wait an extra 45 minutes for the manager to work that out with Chase or Expedia or whoever actually does the booking
* The hotel (Marriott) was actually fine, but when I went to turn in my corporate expense report, our business manager needed an itemized receipt (nightly room charge, taxes, fees, etc.), which Chase does not provide in any form (only property, number of nights, and total)
* After over an hour on the phone talking to four difference Chase representatives (in seemingly four different countries), I was told that itemized booking information is unavailable (even though this information was shown on screen at the time of booking, if I recall)
* Despite inputting my Marriott Bonvoy # at the time of booking, Bonvoy has no record of this stay for the purposes of elite night credits (I believe this is par for the course for travel portals, but I thought since Chase asked for the #, maybe there was some hope)
* To add insult to injury, I didn't even get the 10X points for this booking! Despite the charge being listed as ""Chase Travel, booked through Chase"", it's listed as 3x points

This thread highlights the issue as well, yet somehow the OP was able to get Chase to send an itemized receipt in their case: [Itemized Chase receipt](https://www.reddit.com/r/awardtravel/comments/s27uno/chase_ultimate_rewards_travel_hotel_receipt/)

Our business manager has forbid me from submitting any expense reimbursements from the Chase booking portal going forward.

I saw u/volcanicglass post about upgrading at the counter and figured I'd ask for a reality check before stranding my points on Emirates. 

So, my plan is to check for first class availability the few days before my flight and if more than a few spots are available, transfer over the 39K miles to avoid any delays (I know it's instant but Amex IT lies). 

The best way to check is to just try to book the maximum number of first class tickets that Emirates will allow, correct? (i.e. I try to book 8 first class tickets and it shows availability, I try to book 9 and it doesn't, I know there's 8 first class seats empty)

Starting point is HND/NRT (or KIX, or anywhere in Japan, really). Ending point is CLJ or any European hub (MUC, FRA, CDG, LHR, etc.). Best cash option I've found is Lufthansa premium economy HND-MUC-CLJ (LH715 + LH1672) on 8/2 for $2.4k plus a $480 upgrade to business. For around the same price there's an Emirates itinerary with an additional stop in Dubai (EK319 + EK045 + LH1670), but better refund conditions.

These prices are a bit high for my taste, so ideally I'd like to find a points redemption to get me there. Options I know of so far:

1. (And this makes me anxious) wait for Lufthansa J to open up (hopefully) 1-3 weeks out, book for 80k + ~$100 fees via aeroplan

2. (Available right now) Emirates J to FRA or MUC for 127k miles + $900, plus a $300 connecting flight

I’m a frequent flyer based in The Netherlands.

As part of my job, I usually fly business class to Asia (Singapore, Bangkok, Manila) and the USA about 6 times a year.

I don’t fly KLM since they are very expensive so I was trying to find lower cost alternatives (indirect flights) and so far for the past 6 year have chosen to fly Star Alliance carriers (flew a whole lot on Turkish Airlines) which works out much more reasonable.

I chose Turkish Airlines Miles and Smiles frequent flyer program since they give you platinum (Turkish Airlines Elite plus) for 24 months and since their business class product was quite nice a few years ago and their prices were low. They also gave you two upgrade vouchers which you could use to upgrade an economy flight to business and I used the points to upgrade my personal vacation flights to business.

Unfortunately, in the past 2-3 years Turkish Airlines have significantly lost their appeal (to me) for a multitude of reasons:

a. Their business class cabins are outdated 2-3-2 where if you sit near the window you nearly have to hop over the other person. Some of their planes have been updated but for the most part their fleet is outdated (from my experience)

b. Booking an upgrade is a complete disaster. Doing it online is not possible so you can only doing on the phone. In the past you could call their call centre and find out if a specific flight on a specific date is upgradeable. So the process was - call and find out, book the flight and then call to upgrade. For some reason this is no longer possible and these days you can’t know in advance if a flight is upgradeable or not so you need to book a flight and pray that it’s upgradeable. Unfortunately in the past two year I have had no success in using points to upgrade my flights and thus their loyalty program lost its appeal.

c. Their upgrade vouchers are quite useless. In the past I have upgraded many flights but these days it seems like they are not allowing upgrades with their vouchers on most dates (can’t know in advance).

d. Their prices are no longer very competitive as they used to be.

I’m thinking about reconsidering and switch to a new star alliance loyalty program.

My question is: which Star Alliance program would be the best one for accumulation of points and getting upgrades/reward tickets? 

I will most likely not always fly with a specific airline.

For my work, I’ll probably fly United, Eva, Turkish, Swiss and Lufthansa depending on price and other variables. And for my holiday I’ll do the same and use points to upgrade or get reward tickets either on the carrier of the program or on other Star Alliance carriers.

I am looking to get feedback on the Hyatts in Denver.

We were originally interested in staying at the Grand Hyatt or Hyatt Regency convention center. However, I see a couple of cons with these:

1. Parking - parking seems to be a problem in Downtown Denver. It seems like most of the big Hyatt’s (Grand, Regency) charge up to $50 a night for parking?

2. The going rates for these hotels are ~$150/12000 points. Not exactly the best value for your points, but it’s the Grand Hyatt, right? Is it still worth staying there, or at a Hyatt Place (like in Aurora), $220/6500 points? I’ve heard this Hyatt is in a bit so nice area, but if it’s safe enough to sleep at and commute from, and is clean and “new”
Enough, I feel it’s worth it.

3. We would still have to pay $30 for breakfast to stay at Grand Hyatt, but alternatively wouldn’t mind staying at a new contemporary Hyatt place with decent continental breakfast.

So parking and extra fees, along with bad dollars per point value, is currently dissuading us from staying at the Grand.

Would you recommend a nice Hyatt Place/House or other Hyatt to stay at? 12,000 points or less preferably. Currently, 6 nights at the Grand Hyatt is 81,000 points, but it might be worth to stay at a Hyatt Place or “cheaper” Hyatt for 50,000 points.

awardtravel,"I asked this subreddit about a month a half ago on upgrading from Y to J on Emirates with miles for my inbound trip back to IAD from MNL. I was successful in getting the upgrade (although it was a miles + cash combo) and wanted to report back on what I did.

I’d subscribed to upgrade alerts the moment I touched down in MNL but did not do automatic upgrades. I also kept checking for J availability throughout the week and there seemed to be some saver seats left for the MNL-DXB leg. However after seeing the cash upgrade price climb higher the closer I got to departure ($4000 the last I checked), I resigned to the fact that the upgrade may never open. Lo and behold, three days before my flight, I got an e-mail and text that limited upgrades with miles had opened for the DXB-IAD leg for 70,200 miles. I had a little bit over a half of that in my account, so I decided to purchase the remaining miles for $540 (discounted 15% because of an ongoing promo), and crossed my fingers my account wouldn’t be flagged for fraud. Thankfully the miles came in instantly and I was able to snag the upgrade.

I was still hoping to get the MNL-DXB leg upgraded and hoped that they would e-mail me a special upgrade promo.

awardtravel,"Booked via ANA. Total came out to be 190,000 and $750 in surcharges for 2 ppl.  Stalked the award calendar for over a month and so happy that it worked out. Still a lot of outbound seats available in early Jan and based on my stalking, there should be more inbound seats coming in the next few days.A few lessons learned from this round of ANA booking:

1. Set your location to Japan. That way, you will see the newest dates on the calendar earlier than if your location was USA.
2. New dates are released everyday at 12am JST but cannot be booked until 9am JST. It's basically view-only during those 9 hrs, which is still helpful
3. For ANA flights, you can lock in an outbound flight by booking a dummy return flight and then changing it later. But you can't do that for partner airlines; both legs must be available to book.

awardtravel,"Ive been trying to get to japan for the cheap for awhile now without having to split my itinerary, but much like buying a house , IT GOT COMPLICATED. Anyways, was deciding between Chase or Amex but since id already been with Amex for a while and some of the best redemptions were with ANA and Virgin, which are both Transfer partners i decided to Switch back to a Amex Gold and start saving. At the time ANA awards with fuels costs for economy were like 55k+$100-200 for fuel, which still made a good bargain for japan from the east coast compared to a regular fare of $1300-1500 . switch to now and the fuel charges are $750+  added to the points its not rly even a savings compared to just booking with cash

Im eyeing up a flight near the end of the year thats got a choice of flights with ana or just united,  and united has it available for 70K MP points plus $50 under a saver award even which is awesome but united isnt a transfer partner, I keep seeing article after article going into detail of how you get get savings by booking through partners airlines but im just not seeing it Virgin has the flight for 105K + fees while Aeroplan has it for 100K plus more fees and KRisflyers has it for 120K+$60.  

TLDR

ive seen sites referencing a way to book United Flights on [United.com](https://United.com) using Partner Miles,  Is there such a thing? or are they just misrepresenting partner redemptions

If not is there any reasonable(or unreasonable) way to get my AMex Points into Mileage plus(not the 3:1 Marriot) to book the 70K flight

awardtravel,"Hi all, so in the recent spurt of award availability to Japan, I have wound up booking two trips to Japan at the same time - with the thought of cancelling the one I don't want. I'm debating which to keep and which to ditch and would appreciate any advice.

1. ORD-HND, HND-LAX, in JAL business. It seems that F has been opening up close-in, at least in these winter months, so it is possible I could later upgrade to JAL F. I'm booked using 60k AA miles each way. I have the tag flight from my home city to ORD, but not from LAX home (yet), but I can add the LAX-home leg at no additional miles, mostly likely, assuming I can find saver Y availability. 

2. I have ANA F booked SFO-HND, HND-SFO, 110k miles r/t. Because these are booked with Virgin miles, I cannot add my home city to SFO, or SFO-home legs without incurring an additional miles cost. 

I'm leaning toward keeping the ANA F and cancelling JAL J. If F opened up on the JAL flight, I would be looking at 80k each way vs. 55k. That 35k savings (one-way) would be sufficient for the tag flight from my home city to SFO, or vice versa. 

The JAL legs are booked separately (one PNR for the outbound, a different one for the return) but the ANA is booked as a r/t, so I *think* I have to keep or cancel the ANA altogether, so I *think* I can't do one on the outbound and one on the return - but would be interested to know if I'm wrong and one of each is a possibility...

To make it happen, we had 3 Players sign up for new cards with 2 players signing up for Amex Gold for SUB and 1 player signing up for VX for SUB. This was on top of my MR I had accrued for the past year.

Booked through **Cathay Pacific**

LHR to IAH (direct). 
British Airways

Premium Economy. 
2 Passengers. 
Redemption: 86K AM + $1K fees. 
Cash Price: $6.4K. 
Redemption Rate: 6.2 cpp

Total Cash Price: $28.1K

Total Saved: $24.6K. 
Overall Redemption Rate: 5.7 cpp

—————————————————————

Some Notes:

1. The flight to MXP was a huge win at only $600 fees but got caught with $2.8K in fees out of LHR. The tradeoff was worth it imo since were traveling with 7 on a direct flight. 

2. Points transferred instantaneously for both Lifemiles and Cathay. I recommend calling in for LM because we got caught with phantom availability for one of our preferred dates. 

3. Both LM and Cathay websites are not great. When booking the Y seats on Cathay, the site had issues showing correct availability and P2 and P3 ran in to account issues while booking. I used point.me to help verify availability but ofc calling in is always best bet.

I am going to travel Delhi to NYC on 6th July this year. I have around 100,000 MR points that I am willing to spend on this flight. I was hoping to get something in Business - as I've never done international travel on Business Class. I created an account on [point.me](https://point.me) for a month and it helped my search process.

I do not want to take Air India Business Class all the way through the direct flight (DEL-JFK) as I've heard its not the best product. The other Airlines are outrageous (such as BA through Alaska - charging 700$ in fuel surcharges). I would like to keep surcharges to under 200-300$. I saw the following on Aeroplan that seems to be my best bet:

AI 111 DEL-LHR Business Class

6 hr layover in LHR (hopefully the lounge will be accessible)

UA 921  LHR - JFK Business Class

This is 90,000 points and roughly 120 $ in surcharges

I had a few questions that I was hoping someone could help me with. 1) Will these flights be on the same PNR, and if yes will my bags be checked on all the way by Air India? 2) Does Air India easily confirm award travel - i heard someone had issues with them. 3) Does anyone know if the lounge accessible at LHR with respect to United is good?

My alternate option is to give up on Business Class and book the same itinerary in Economy for 55k points (same surcharge of 120 $) or take Etihad economy for 70k points (&lt;100 $ charge).

So the people being alienated are potential new customers who don't know much. They'll just try another airline since, at this level of engagement, who wants to create an account for every airline just to search for a flight. Most of the big players don't require a login anyways.

P2: 81K Cap1
P3: 75K MR

Ive found a specific date using point.me and Cathay’s site that looks like it has availability but had some questions below. 

1. To book us all on the same flight, my idea was to have everyone create Asia Miles accounts and book separately but call Cathay first to confirm availability. Is that the right way to go about it? I know you can transfer pts to the same Asia Miles acct but the fees around $140 which doesnt make sense. 

2. Is Cathay notorious for phantom availability in any way? Ill call to confirm before transferring points ofc to avoid a situation where we cant transfer pts back. 

3. Any tips or warnings before booking with Cathay? Not a rookie to award travel but first redemption with Cathay so looking to not make rookie mistakes. 

4. Anyone know how long pts take to transfer between Amex + Cap1 to Cathay?

After about two months of trying I finally found a non-phantom space and booked the award. 200,000 AS Miles for me and P2 one way.

EWR-SIN in J, overnight 22 hour layover. 
Arrive in SIN 5pm leave next day 3pm - worth it for a layover? Check a few things out? Get some food? Or just go to lounge and eat then head to hotel and sleep? Next is 

SIN to BKK in J



Originally I had round trip small home airport (XYZ) to BKK through Qatar Air in Y.

XYZ-JFK (2.5 hr layover) 

JFK - DOH (2.5 hr layover)

DOH-BKK… think the trip is 24 hrs total

XYZ doesn’t fly direct to EWR for less than $1000 currently, so I will be spending ~$250 to go through IAD. Flight schedule kind of sucks so it’s looking like arrive in IAD at midnight, stay in EWR a day, then leave the following morning at 930 AM.

Thoughts? Is this worth it?  Never flown J before so I’m pretty excited but I dunno feel like I could potentially do better last minute and snag something else- and if not suffer through economy on the way to BKK and try for something else on the way back. Any input is appreciated. 

My way back has 8 HR layover in DOH and in JFK so could be nice to atleast get a last minute award and fly in J? Not guaranteed though. Any input is appreciated","Booked my first award, now wondering",,arcticrd,,0,1/25/2023 8:01

awardtravel,"Hello everyone. Long time lurker here looking for some advice.

I've done some amateur award travel in the past. Nothing lucrative nor inspirational about my previous trips, just been in Chase UR ecosystem and transferred UR points to UA occasionally for some good deals like one-way business UA Polaris to SEA, or round trip economy USA-SEA when cash prices were high, etc. I found UA program easy to use with lots of availability for award tickets.

I was bored of Chase ecosystem and wanted to give AMEX a try, since I got a target offer for AMEX Plat 150k, so I need to look for new airline programs to start putting some miles into (with upcoming paid business trips) and eventually transfer some MR points to. My time frame for award travel is to do some business class for 2 people in about 1.5-2 year.

* Destinations for travel: South East Asia for family visits, but willing to do stop over in interesting places. 
* Travel time frame: Early of the year like Jan - Mar or late summer for 1-2 weeks
* I'm in SW Ohio, so no major airline hub nearby. Although, I'm willing to drive myself to ORD or DTW if there are good deals.

I've been looking at a couple airline loyalty programs (which are transfer partners of MR) and here are my thoughts so far.

* ANA
   * Good award chart that fits my travel patterns, but holy shit does the availability dries up so quickly, or everything is wait listed.
* Aeroplan
   * Great award search engine but everything requires pretty high amount of miles. I'm not sure why many bloggers rave about this program, but I could be misunderstanding something here.
   * Good amount of availability though.
* British Airways
   * Technically can book AA flights but the website and search tools are so garbage.
* Singapore
   * Only flies from LAX/JFK and PITA to get myself there.

The June date doesn’t work for me anymore and I’d like to move it to July or August but obviously there’s no availability anymore. I’m also fine just not using the flight at all anymore and booking something separate, it’s kind of an inconvenient routing anyway. 

I think these are my only options but want to make sure I’m not missing anything

1. Don’t show up - forfeit the miles and taxes? Would ideally like to at least get the taxes back somehow if I don’t fly, but not sure if they do that. Don’t mind losing the miles as much since it was already a good deal and I have tons of ANA miles I still need to burn anyway 
2. Hope for a flight change before June and cancel the ticket, get half back - 47.5K miles and $250. I’m assuming this would probably happen in March/April if it’s going to happen but not sure 
3. Look for last minute availability for July or August and change it a few days before the flight. Not too bullish on this since I could only move it a few days at a time at best so I’d have to do it like 5-10 times to get to July.

I called UA to change my LHR-EWR and EWR-IAD flight to this direct flight, while the ATQ-DEL and DEL - EWR segments remain the same.  United told me that it is not possible even though the website shows the flight as available for the same price because thisnflight doesn't show up if I search ATQ to IAD instead of DEL to IAD and they can't just change a segment.

I only travel around the States, and really only stay in Holiday Inn/Express and the very occasional Crowne Plaza or Indigo. The room upgrades are nice, but not a game changer for me, and the staff at these hotels usually don’t even acknowledge I’m Diamond.

I wouldn’t pay cash for the upgrade to Ambassador, but I do have 1.6m points, so spending 40k for it wouldn’t be a big loss.

I am fairly new to the world of award travel, so please don't bash me! \^\^

So, the Venture X is my main travel card, and I have a lot of miles on it, ready to be used. So far, for mostly national travels, it's been a wonderful experience for me.

I am aware that United is not a transfer partner for Cap1, but I thought I could use Avianca as a transfer partner and book United flights through them. However, this does not seem to be the case if you are interested in international flights.

I am looking to book a BOS-FCO flight, and I saw that the best miles option I could find is with United for roughly 33k miles, one way, plus a little cash fee. Being able to book that flight would be perfect for my needs.

However, when I try to search for this flight on the Avianca website, I don't even see any option for a BOS-FCO flight. This may be because Avianca does not cover that specific international trip. 

This makes it impossible for me to transfer capital one miles to cover the purchase of that United flight. 

Am I just short on luck, and I need to find another solution (and start racking points on Chase instead, as I am originally from Italy and I will be flying that route quite often to visit family in the future), or is there some other way I can go about booking that United flight I am drooling over?

awardtravel,"One of the common bits of wisdom posted here regularly for finding TATL J Awards is to be willing to fly to any major EU hub airport, and then take advantage of the many low cost carriers and such to travel to your final destination within the EU zone.   While this makes sense if you can find J availability in advance, it seems more difficult when looking at closer in bookings.

For example , a common strategy from the US east coast is to book a changeable less than ideal Y class flight, then wait until T-2 weeks or so as LH and LX tend to release a fair amount of J and even F availability at this time from the major EC hubs.  The concern I have doing this is with such short notice, how easy is it to find the necessary connecting flights within Europe.   Even looking now from NYC area and PHL for the fall of 2023, while there is limited J availability to DUB on EI, the connections from there aren't great.

&amp;#x200B;

So, business class has opened up and I'll be able to get my partner a J class ticket via aircanada for 58k points + $60 USD. 58k because we had transferred points over during the last 30% bonus chase had (we moved enough points over for 2 J tickets), so now I'm considering whether I should also book business and let the F class ticket go.

This will be a redeye flight and I've heard that the food is limited, so I won't be getting the full dining experience. Both F and J get LAX lounge access, so that won't make a difference. Besides the limited menu and missing out on hibiki 17, are there any other significant differences between first and business class in terms of other services/amenities?

For first, I paid 43k points + $360 USD. I'll also have to spend another $90 to go from HND to Osaka. (Redemption value of .33/pt)

For business, it will cost me 58k points + $60, which also includes the HND to Osaka flight. However, I will be paying a $50 virgin Atlantic fee to cancel my award seat. (Redemption value of .07/pt)

In all, I will be saving $340 to switch over to business with the benefit of being able to sit with my partner.

awardtravel,"My partner and I want to travel more comfortably as we get older and I've been researching how we can use loyalty points / build status with an airline to achieve this by way of award tickets, free upgrades etc. We also have a ton of UR points already but we're not sure how to go about this strategy.

**About us:**

- Home airport: JFK (we occasionally travel from LGA or EWR as well)
- Preferred domestic airline: DL
- Goals: Increase likelihood of traveling in business class or above, both domestically and internationally; we will have frequent travel to/from the Philippines (MNL) and want to make this as comfortable as possible

Existing loyalty programs and balances:

|Program name|Held by|Points|
|------------|-------|------|
|Chase UR    |Me     |~350k |
|Chase UR    |Partner|~150k |
|DL SkyMiles |Me     |~13k  |

My partner and I each have our own Chase Sapphire Preferred card and put all of our daily spend on that. We are not the biggest spenders but ~500k UR points over 4 years is decent I guess (and I'll caveat that my partner was taking the cash back option every year up until last year). We don't have any other credit cards that earn points but we have good credit and could open a new one.

**Why I think DL could be right**
I am considering loyalty w/ DL specifically because I like their soft product (we think it's the best option for domestic US flights) and they have great options out of JFK.

Also, I have a friend who is at least Platinum SkyMiles status and about 50% of the time they're getting free upgrades + always have lounge access and a phone concierge for when things go wrong – and these benefits extend automatically to their travel companion.

With that said, my friend has the Delta SkyMiles Amex Platinum card, spends more money than me, travels more than me (they have some business travel and I rarely do), and has been building up their loyalty for a longer period of time. 

**Here are my questions**

1. Does switching our credit cards and point strategy to focus on DL make sense, given our home airport? Is there another airline we should be considering?
2. Given our spending habits and flying habits (figure 1 RT domestic trip and 1 RT international trip for each of us per year), is achieving any kind of status on DL possible?
3. Can we use our Chase UR points to start accruing loyalty on airline right away?

Thank you for your help and sorry if this is dumb. I read the FAQs and I have a grasp on how award bookings work but thinking of a strategy to increase award bookings and quality in our future is something I could use advice on.

**TL;DR:** Partner and I want to travel more frequently and with more comfort; considering choosing DL to focus loyalty points accrual on but wondering if that is the smartest option given our home airport, travel destinations, and annual spend.",Home airport is JFK; which airline should I build loyalty with?,,stuffiwannaknow,,0,1/22/2023 14:30
awardtravel,"Hello everyone except those looking for 4 J tickets to Japan during Cherry Blossom season trying to use Wyndham points. I wanted to share my success in booking round trip business tickets using the highly coveted ANA program. Let me tell you, it felt like a full time job and took a lot of patience, constant searching, luck, and a lot of phone calls fighting through multiple schedule changes. But I am so happy for putting in the effort as it let me visit my family and learn how to maximize points for me and my family going forward.

**TLDR:** Used 90k AMEX points and 25k expiring EVA points to book JFK-TPE (EVA), TPE-KIX (EVA), and NRT-IAD (ANA) and around $350-$400 in taxes/fees. (2021 pricing at the time). Constant searching on Cowtool and United's search engine helped me find open availability. I got my points through my AMEX platinum sub. I also set up alerts on Expertflyer. 
----
**Summary** 
I have been trying to get over to Taiwan as soon as they reopened for non-citizens and not require a quarantine. I had speculatively booked my trip from US East Coast to Taiwan to arrive in Summer 2022, however most countries in Asia including Taiwan were not ""open"" yet. Due to schedule changes and no progress of Taiwan and Japan not opening up in Summer 2022, I started looking for flights in the winter starting in March 2022. After constantly searching, I found flights in December and January that were acceptable and was ecstatic to be able to visit my extended family in over 3 years. I had booked EVA business from JFK to TPE in December and then TYO-IAD originally on United in January. However, I ran into a lot of issues with my return leg around route cancellations.

**Challenges and how I resolved them**
My challenge revolved around my return flight which was a direct flight operated by United from NRT-IAD. However, United ended up cancelling that route permanently and will start up their IAD-TYO schedule through HND this Spring. Luckily I did not fall into the classic partner award trap (when a partner cancels and you are left without a flight) and the computer automatically rebooked me from NRT-EWR-IAD. However, I had a 50 minute connection, which guarantees me missing my scheduled flight because how can you get through customs/immigration/check bags/clear security at EWR in 50 minutes. You can't even get off the plane from DCA-EWR after sitting on the tarmac for 50 minutes! 

However, ANA had a direct flight from NRT-IAD on their own metal, although no award space was available. I called in to try to get them to change me onto their own metal and waited on hold about an hour each time to only be told they can't open up space for me. I was persistent as my family was originally on that cancelled United flight and were able to persuade United agents to swap them over to the direct ANA flight. They had an easier time as they paid for their tickets and paying for a direct flight &gt; transferring through EWR. On my third HUCA, I spoke to such a nice agent and she saw my family was on the direct flight and knew what I was going to ask for before I asked. (call agents can see the notes, I used to work in one :P). She said she would put in a request to open up space and a few days later I received an email confirming my spot! 

**No award availability to get from TPE to Japan**
When I originally booked my ANA flight, I couldn't book any reasonable flight from TPE to Japan. I was trying to go to KIX as my family were on a paid ticket from TPE to KIX. Cash prices were extremely high or at terrible times (6am Peach airlines anyone??). One of my family members had expiring EVA points that could be transferred. Although there was no availability, I used them to waitlist for a J award on one of their new 787-10s that had wide open seat space. From my understanding, EVA clears all upgrade and reward requests so I had a good feeling mine would clear. (or else I am flying Peach at 6am for $300+).  I added myself to the waitlist in August and someone called me almost exactly 2 months later in October and told me I cleared for my December-end flight. Kachow!!! Almost all my travel plans are done.

**Time to figure out positioning to JFK to catch my EVA flight**
It's October and almost all my travel plans are set. I have hotels and other accommodations. I just need to get my butt to JFK and make sure I don't miss my flight. Usually I would stay in NYC but it was December and people love NYC in the winter for whatever reason. Crappy hotels are $400+. So I had to  do something I wouldn't recommend, I booked a positioning flight on a separate itinerary. Due to costs and wanting to ensure additional flights in case mine was canceled/delayed, I booked a 4pm flight from IAD-LGA on United and also had a backup DCA-JFK flight on Delta that I could cancel for credit. I ended up taking the flight to LGA. Instead of running over to JFK for my 12am flight, I went to Flushing, Queens for dinner. Yeah I got Chinese food even though I was headed to Taiwan. I can't help it, Flushing has some of the best Chinese food in the US. Now its around 6:30 and I didn't want to carry my luggage around NY so I head over to JFK. I couldn't get into a lounge until around 9 but that is a whole other story arguing with AMEX lounge dragons (no success).

**Tools used**
Cowtool is probably the most helpful tool out there for finding Star Alliance award spots. I put in dates that I knew I could travel and just constantly searched. I also set up tens of alerts on days I could fly on and from different cities on Expertflyer. 

**How to get the points**
I get around half of my points through subs, a bunch through Rakuten, and then just regular spend on travel/restaurants/grocery with my AMEX plat and gold cards.

1) Create a Iberia Air account and Aer Lingus Account (you could also use a British Airways account if you already have one)

2) Use the Aer Lingus or British Airways account credentials to log in to [www.avios.com](https://www.avios.com).

3) Transfer your Amex points to Aer Lingus (it says that it will take 24 to 48 hours, but the points will appear immediately in the [avios.com](https://avios.com) portal.  

4) Use Firefox (maybe another browser.  Chrome did not work for me and produced an error message when I tried to transfer the Avios to Iberia).  Log in to [avios.com](https://avios.com) and select ""my avios"" in the top left and then ""manage my account"" towards to middle right of the screen.  

5) Select ""Combine my Avios"" from the manage account menu.

6) Transfer the balance of Avios (which should be what you just brought in to Aer Lingus from Amex) to your Iberia profile.  Your IB plus number is your 9 digit frequent flyer number and your pin is your password.  

7) The transfer was immediate.  The Avios were available in Iberia and I booked a mileage flight right away.  

**Potential Problems:**

[**Avios.com**](https://Avios.com) **won't recognize your Iberia account when you go to transfer:**

Initially, when I tried to transfer the Avios from [Avios.com](https://Avios.com) to Iberia it said that my account was not recognized.  You need to make sure all of your information matches in both Aer Lingus (or British Airways) and Iberia.  I went in to the profile in both and had to update my address and birthday so that they matched on both sites.  

**Error messages when transferring from** [**Avios.com**](https://Avios.com) **to Iberia:** 

I got an error that said something like ""unable to transfer, try later."" when I tried to transfer points in Chrome.  I initially got it to work by running chrome in incognito, then figured out that it works in Firefox.  

**Points still won't transfer from Avios to Iberia:**

Before attempting to bring over the Amex points, I transferred 1000 Chase Ultimate reward points in to my newly created Iberia account.  I did this hoping it would make the direct transfer from Amex to Iberia on the Amex website work, but it did not.  It could have been the key though that activated the Iberia account to avoid the 90 day account rule,  I am not sure.  Try it as a last resort if the steps above don't work.  

**PRO TIP**

It is always a gamble transferring points out of Amex.  Once they are out, they aren't going back in.  I was worried that my points would end up in Avios purgatory, so I did two test runs of 1000 points.

First from Avios to Iberia, then Iberia back to [Avios.com](https://Avios.com).  

Once I was confident that it worked I brought in the remaining balance of points. 

In short, do a test run with 1000 points.

awardtravel,"I searched and didn't see a similar situation come up, apologies if I missed it. My situation:

- Bought AA roundtrip tickets RDU &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DUB
- AA return flight included 1st leg run by partner Air Lingus (Dublin -&gt; LHR)
- Air Lingus was delayed, so missed connecting AA flight from LHR -&gt; JFK
- Once Air Lingus delay caused us to miss AA flight, it disappeared from AA app and the reservation vanished, like we never existed. Air Lingus was put in charge of finding us new flight to U.S.
- Air Lingus found us new flight on United (LHR -&gt; IAD)(which experienced horrible delays, but that's a separate issue)

Here's the problem: No airline is willing to give us miles for the LHR -&gt; IAD flight. 

AA said they were no longer involved, since it wasn't them but their partner (Air Lingus) that botched the first leg of the flight, so not their responsibility (even though we of course didn't book with Air Lingus, we booked with AA, who decided to have Air Lingus run the first leg).

United isn't giving us the miles either. (We also have complaint pending with United due to delay and consequent costs.)

Has anyone had this issue come up before? I wanted AA miles coming in, that's why I booked with them, so it sucks that they wiped their hands after *their* partner caused us to miss an AA flight. But it definitely seems like United should give us the miles, even though we didn't originally book with them (and had no control over the booking Air Lingus made with United).

* We already purchased United Economy tickets from BOS to SFO and saw that we could upgrade to Business for 20k miles and 75 bucks per person (there are two of us), but it's a waitlist and there's no option to get a confirmed upgrade.
   * If we transfer like 33k (I already have some miles with United) of our Chase Ultimate Rewards points to snag this hopefully, but don't get the upgrade, would the 33k only stay in the United account? It can't be returned to Chase right?
   * How likely do you think will we get an upgrade? There are around 5 seats left in Business right now. I don't quite understand the United upgrade hierarchy on their website- like I don't see anything about upgrading using miles. 
* We're also keeping in mind that we want to go to Asia on a business class roundtrip fare from anywhere in either the US east or west coast, like a year and a half from now. That's really all we're saving for. Our one Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card is just at 133k right now, but I'm justifying using 33k of it because we plan on getting two new cards very soon and we believe that with all our spending and the current amount of points and the bonus sign up points, we'll easily achieve this in a year and a half (one card for me and one card for my boyfriend). 
   * So my question about this is: are we allowed to pool points from all our credit cards to use in one booking with two tickets with any US to Asia airline like maybe Singapore, ANA, Qatar, Emirates, etc for their ANA room, QSuites, etc. type fares? 
   * Should we just forget this small United upgrade and focus all our efforts into the Asia trip? Is the United one even an ""ok"" deal in the first place? I've done Polaris before and it's a hit or miss, but we just wanna be comfy.

Additional info… 

——————————————

Hey all. I’ve been following the Vegas guides on here and various travel sites for a while now regarding churning and rewards etc. I finally took the chance and applied for the Wyndham Rewards Earner Business Card. I was denied at first… but I called Barclay’s recon dept and got approved (yay!). So I’m planning on matching my newly earned Wyndham Diamond status to Caesars Diamond status online in the next couple days. After I get Diamond at Caesars, I want to match to MGM Gold, then to Hyatt Explorist so I can match between MGM &lt;—&gt; Hyatt each year without physically traveling back to Vegas each February. 

Here’s where I’m confused, all of the guides online say to match your Hyatt to MGM during February each year, and some say to match MGM to Hyatt during March each year. Others say to match MGM to Hyatt during January. But since it’s already late January and I’m only just about to obtain MGM Gold, is it better to wait and match my Caesars to MGM next month so the status lasts longer? It seems as though Caesars &amp; MGM statuses reset on January 31 and Hyatt resets on Feb 28th if I’m reading this correctly? 

I was planning on making a quick trip to Vegas before the end of this month to match my Caesars to MGM so I can match to Hyatt before February.

Is this the correct way to do this? If I match my Caesars to MGM this month (January), will my MGM Gold status only last until the end of this month, Jan 2023, or extend to Jan 2024? Or should I just wait until next month to match everything all at once (Caesars/MGM/Hyatt)?

I’m just trying to make sure I don’t mess up the expiration dates of MGM/Hyatt so they will overlap properly for next year and not expire early so I can rematch. I’m confused on which month I should match both programs. 

Lastly, can anyone verify that this MGM &lt;—&gt; Hyatt matching Merry-Go-Round still works? I’ve seen various comments saying they’ve cracked down on this recently and people receive this message when trying to rematch between the two programs: “Your M life Rewards and World of Hyatt membership accounts could not be matched”.

RT: $2.5k for HKG-MAD most dates. With Amex Biz Plat, 162.5k MR net, seems like the best deal. Not sure if I should wait and hope for a better deal. This option makes me feel only ANA RT not on LH/LX or AA/AS not on BA (fees) would be a better option.

does anybody know when exactly are Skywards tier miles credited onto one's account? Is it at the time of departure or when landing? Reason why I ask is that I'm travelling on Jan 31st and I need the points for my next tier to be credited in January, however I will land on Feb 1st hence it matters if they are credited when landing or departing

awardtravel,"Just finished ticketing an ANA RTW trip today, and got quite a few tidbits from it that I think could be helpful to others trying to book one of these things.  To start off, here's my itinerary below, all flights in business class.  The total timing of the trip spans roughly 3 months from September to December 2023.

|Depart|Arrive|Airline|
|:-|:-|:-|
|LAX|TPE|BR|
|TPE|BKK|BR|
|BKK|ADD|ET|
|ADD|RUH|ET|
|JED|CAI|MS|
|CAI|CMN|MS|
|GVA|EWR|UA|

**Total: 125,000 MR transferred to ANA + $641 in taxes and fees for one person.  Total distance = \~20,400 miles (approx 300 miles less than gcmap)**

I spent the better part of the past week mapping out all possible iterations of this itinerary and actually thought I had something really good early on that involved TAP Air Portugal.  Instead of the last segment being UA GVA-EWR I had TP LIS-EWR.  I also had TP CMN-LIS.  But when I called ANA to piece the whole thing together the agent quoted a whopping $1800 total for taxes and fees.  This made no sense to me because as far as I could tell the only high YQ airline in the itinerary was EgyptAir.  I had read on multiple sites that TAP was known to have low YQ across most/all flights.

But then thanks to some helpful folks on here I did some further reading on FT/Reddit and found a few recent reports of exorbitant YQ on TAP flights.  So I scrapped the TAP segments and started looking at alternate flights back from Europe to the States.  I don't care about the European destination, I just wanted to find a low YQ transatlantic flight and knew I'd only spend a few days in whichever European city it ended up being.

Luckily I didn't have much trouble finding a few dates in December with UA Polaris seats from GVA-EWR.  Another good option was LOT Polish which has pretty wide open availability from WAW-JFK in December, but I didn't like that as much because there are no direct flights from CMN-WAW.  Neither CMN-WAW nor CMN-GVA had viable Star Alliance options (only option was TK through IST, which would bump my total mileage into the next band), so I'm just going to book a separate ticket to get from CMN-GVA.

Once I called back and asked the agent to scrap TP CMN-LIS and LIS-EWR and replace with just UA GVA-EWR, the total taxes and fees dropped to $640!  I couldn't believe how much YQ was from the TAP flights.  I was especially surprised because I had looked up the YQ on ITA Matrix and it was approx $550 for the TAP flights, but ANA had about double that in their calculations.  I also asked the rep to price the whole thing with WAW-JFK on LOT Polish instead of GVA-EWR on UA, and that came in at $700 total fees.  So UA and LOT Polish are similar, both very low YQ as expected.

Couple other wrinkles I encountered.  First, I was trying to end the trip in YUL, but was told that the trip must originate and end in the same country.  I thought I had read somewhere that it just had to originate and end in the same continent, but I guess that was inaccurate.

Second, I had found space on United's website for TG BKK-JED which would have been a more ideal direct routing than laying over in ADD, but for some reason the agents couldn't see that space at all across multiple dates.  They also couldn't see the TG flights from TPE-BKK, only the BR flights.  I believe ANA may be unable to book any short haul TG flights currently.  I don't know if this is a recent development or what.

awardtravel,"I just returned from a long-awaited trip to Calala Island, and it was 100% my best redemption so far. I won’t write a full review because there are plenty already posted here and elsewhere, but I’ve seen a lot of discussions here and on FlyerTalk about whether Calala is worth the risks, so I thought I’d give my perspective on those concerns. I’m assuming some familiarity with the property/process here.

*Cancellation*

This seems to be the most common hang up people here have about booking. I’d read all of the horror stories of flights to Managua getting canceled and people who booked Calala on points being charged a half (or full!) cash rate for canceling within 90 days. I gave myself a two day buffer in Managua, but the FAA outage still required us to spend two extra nights in Miami and miss one of our scheduled four nights on the island.

If they’d planned to charge me the full cash rate I’d probably have just shelled out for a different flight on another airline, but I only ended up just having to eat the points cost for the first night. I also had the option of moving the whole reservation to another time. Ymmv obviously, but it was never suggested to me that I’d have to pay cash. 

*Gratuity*

We tipped $100/day, plus an extra $100 that we wanted to go to the (excellent) masseuse. Unfortunately, giving individual tips to staff members is not allowed, so the $400 was spread amongst the staff according to their rank by the GMs.

Side note here to echo previous posts: none of the five couples on the island paid the full cash rate for their stay. The three British couples all won their stays in charity auctions, and the other American couple also used points. I have to assume the owner uses this as a tax write off because there’s no way it makes money.

*Journey*

First, you have to get to Managua. As I mentioned, I had two wait two days after missing my connection because there wasn’t another American Airlines flight scheduled for the following day. Definitely give yourself a buffer.

There’s also an online Nicaraguan immigration form that’s “required” to enter the country. Ours were never processed and no one ever asked about them, but it did give me plenty of anxiety that I wouldn’t make it in until we were past customs. You should do it early for the peace of mind but just know that it isn’t important.

I don’t have much to add about the boat journey except to say that it’s as bad as everyone says it is. Just take some non-drowsy Dramamine and know that the other side is worth it.

*Food*

Some recent FlyerTalk threads suggest that the food has gotten worse. I guess I can’t know whether that’s the case, but we thought it was delicious. Breakfast could have been a bit better, but the pizzas were amazing, the seafood was fresh, and we had two tasting menus in our three nights there. They will make anything you want if they have the ingredients. I’d compare it to the food at any nice resort, and certainly better than most AIs.

*Seclusion*

This is the area where I most disagree with the review consensus. Everyone seems to say that you often feel like the only people on the island, and that was not our experience at all. There were five couples on the island, and we got to know all of them pretty well. We had all three meals together unless we decided to get something sent to the room. I guess we could have isolated ourselves a bit more, but the resort is so small that it’s naturally pretty commmunal. We liked that and didn’t feel like it detracted from the romantic aspect at all— we made time for ourselves between meals and loved meeting everyone.

I think that’s all that hasn’t been thoroughly covered elsewhere—happy to answer questions if anyone has any!",Calala Island Details,,GreenTide17,,0,1/17/2023 20:48

Flying Blue Points Problem

02/2020: I booked a flight in February 2020 with 144,000 miles to go to Europe for a family trip.

03/2020: Covid shut down the travel possibilities and the points stayed in Flying Blue.

10/2021: Pursuant to their 24 month point extension policy, I booked, with Flying Blue points, a Delta flight from TPA to Cincinnati for 11,500 miles. I spoke with a Flying Blue representative who said that the trip would qualify for the 24 month extension.

12/31/2022: The Flying Blue website says my 132,500 remaining miles are expired.

01/17/2023: I went to rebook the original journey to Europe when I saw my Flying Blue miles balance is zero. I called Flying Blue and they said, because I didn’t travel within 6 months, the points expired. 

I quoted their website that says:

“With global restrictions gradually being lifted, we want to let you know that we’ve reinstated our standard Miles validity policy. This means that some or all of your Miles will expire by 31 December 2022. We would like to share with you how you can extend the validity of your Miles or the many ways there are spend them.

You can extend the validity of your Miles for 2 years when you complete a flight with Air France, KLM or one of our 32 airline partners around the world before 31 December 2022.”

The Flying Blue representative told me that the policy means I had to purchase a flight with cash, not points. I said, the policy says, “complete a flight.” Flying Blue said the representative I spoke to in 2021 was wrong, my points are expired, however, I can purchase a new flight within 6 months, and request that the 132,500 expired points be credited back to my account, but it isn’t guaranteed. They refused to let me speak to an escalation department because it is not their policy.

awardtravel,"This should be a simple report, booking AA premium economy USA to Hawaii, but like many things with award booking, it wasn't.

AA had partner award space from my regional airport to OGG (Maui). AA wanted 45k miles, but I find AA miles very valuable for domestic Y flights, and it was not worth it.

I had some BA miles that were transferred during a transfer bonus period (this is not recommended on this sub, but I use BA miles regularly so I am comfortable doing this periodically) and I first attempted to use those miles. BA was showing the flight for \~30K miles. It errored when I attempted to book online. I called twice, and both agents said that they were unable to ticket the ticket that had 1 segment in PE and 1 in Y.

I had some abandoned Cathay Pacific Asia miles from a canceled trip during the pandemic. Cathay Pacific was able to see the space, but they were not able to price the award due to my regional airport not being in their database. They put the ticket on hold for 5 days and said that they would price out the ticket. Three phone calls later and an extension of the hold, they finally priced out the ticket. They ticketed the ticket, and when I attempted to add AA FF numbers to the reservation, I discovered that they spelled my wife's last name wrong (with CX, you create a profile for people that you book reservations for, and in that profile the information was correct and it was the only time the information was supplied). I then called back and they said that they could not change names on award tickets. They wanted to charge me \~$150 to split the PNR and issue the misspelled ticket on a new PNR. A supervisor was finally able to see that this was their mistake and waive the fee.

AA's official policy is that they will not add an AA frequent flyer number to a partner award ticket. Normally I put the partner PNR in Finnair or Royal Jordanian and switch it to my AA number. Both those programs were unable to find the reservation (BA could). I then used Amadeus's CheckMyTrip App to find the AA PNR and asked AA via Twitter to change the FF # and they did it, problem solved.

As a positive the reservation is upgradable. The official policy of AA is that you need to be Executive Platinum to have your award reservation be eligible for complimentary status upgrades. You can see if it is upgradable because in the app ""Upgrades"" will appear and it will say you have been added to the upgrade list.

It looked like the flight from Maui to the mainland would have a good chance of being upgraded since there were 11 open lie-flat business seats left 48 hours out. Then the FAA outage happened and 75% of AAA flights the previous day out of Maui were canceled. This filled the plane up 100% and even with \~300 people on the flight there were only 14 people on the upgrade list (I was 2 of them).

This wasn't the best value redemption to Hawaii, but it cut off a good number of miles for the reward.

Takeaways

* If the standard using Finnair or Royal Jordanian to change your OneWorld FF number does not work, try asking AA on Twitter, even though it is against their policy.
* If you find an AA wideboy flying from the west coast to Hawaii PE could price as 18k via CX (narrow bodies without PE are much much more common)
* Booking partner rewards can be an exercise in patience
* Always review the spelling of the names on your ticket, even if you input them correctly.",Booking report: AA Premium Economy,,pbjclimbing,,0,1/17/2023 14:02

Didn’t realize the NRT-JFK segment wasn’t operational at the time but had high hopes of it being active by my departure (mid year). I was waiting for the summer schedule which seems to not be out yet but then got a cancellation and rebooking email. NRT-JFK cancelled, but was rebooked automatically to HND-JFK. Problem was my layover connecting flight would not have allowed this changed. I called the Japan customer service number (with the US number being off hours and I’ve heard long wait times). I was on hold for maybe 2 minutes, person I spoke to was very friendly and very helpful. Unfortunately for the connecting flight, only one J was available; but she said she would email to request J space and to expect an email of a ticket (if space given) in 2 days. Got an email after an hour with the new itinerary.

Basically it took the standard, non-promotional ratios that Amex, Chase, et. al used and let you input how many points you had, spitting out a projected estimate if you transferred everything to one airline. Obviously you aren't going to do this much, but you don't have to do math if you are looking to maximize a specific airline for a goal.

For reference, I'm booked with EY this Thursday PEK - AUH (EYand then another leg onwards in economy. PEK - AUH is the slightly longer of the two legs at \~9h on their 781 and I'm currently seated in Economy Space on that leg, and standard Economy on the other leg. I paid out of pocket around \~500USD for the entire ticket, which I consider to be pretty good value already. 

On the page to bid for upgrade to J (both starting bids on both legs are pretty shit IMO), there has been an instant upgrade offer for the PEK - AUH leg that popped up. This is lower than the respective starting bid for the leg, and it's for \~700USD or \~77K EY Guest miles (for me, 77K MR). 

If I upgrade, I would definitely choose to upgrade with miles rather than cash, because this would already represent good cpp relative to booking J from the outset, and I have a stack of MR at the moment and am rather inflexible with respect to redemption times. Seeing what going rates for J bookings are, summing $500+77K doesn't seem too horrendous of a deal (pretending like the second leg cost the entire $500). 

I've never flown EY or EY J - would this be a good opportunity to try it out? Two minor questions to those who fly EY regularly - 

* How does the EY 781 J hard product stack up to the rest of their fleet (I know soft product might be a bit wonky flying out of PEK nowadays)
* If I upgrade just the first leg, would I get access to the business lounge in AUH?

\- Chase UR: 316K

\- Delta: 132K

\- Hyatt: 17K

Flights: We don't need fancy seats just non-stop because of the baby. I think my only real option is AA or Delta, but Delta is way too expensive. And since AA doesn't do miles + cash, is my best option just to book one-way flights for 3 in points, then the other one-way flights for 3 in cash? Total for both ways would be 200K miles, which I don't have.

* The Biz one is expensive and my personal business is on hold so no expenses.  If I don't want to pay $300 for the Delta Gold, **should I just use up the points fast and cancel it?**
* Contemplating the Delta Amex Platinum but can't decide. **Should I use up my two gold card points then get a platinum?** How do you do that calculation? I really don't get how people manage all the cards....
* **Right now I'm splitting expenses between my personal Delta Gold and the CapOne Venture**...is that what I should be doing? (I have bank accounts in US and EU, but I don't think the EU has good loyalty credit cards?). 

**#2:** I'm sick of Airbnb and thinking  I should stay in hotels to get points. I do economical when alone, then splash out with the my kids. I'm mostly in France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and the UK. I gather Bonvoy has a pretty bad loyal program, Hyatt is too expensive for me.

I wanted to know the relationship between ANA miles to ANA sky coins and ANA sky coins to pounds.

So, I'm looking to book a business class flight from London to Tokyo via ANA. However,  I don't have enough ANA miles to book for the reward flight. So I read online that you can convert ANA miles to sky coins and that can be used for a discount on a normal flight booking.

So, my question how much discount does ANA sky coins give for a flight that's costs £3,800 if I have 80,000 Sky coins?

I couldn't find anywhere online on how much sky coins are worth.

* Origin: Either London or Paris
* Destination: Washington Dulles (IAD)
* Seat selection: J seat
* Date: 3 June 2023 is preferred, but can do 2-4 June if that gets me a better chance of finding something
* Points status: Currently have 105K Chase Ultimate Rewards Points and, for what it's worth, $200 in the United Travel Bank. I am earning a 150K point SUB for my AmEx Platinum, but I likely won't have earned it in time to book a flight for a reasonable price.

United has a J seat for 170K points + $140 which doesn't seem worth it to me and Air France has one for 245K points + $385 which is crazy. Notwithstanding the fact that I can't afford those points.

awardtravel,"Hi- I promised I've tried to poke around but have hit a wall with my confusion on J award availability on American Air and ability to book with other partners. 

I see on the American website that theres several awards available for what seems to be the lowest rate from NYC- Buenos Aires all through the summer. Then I go on expert flyer and it says plenty of J flight avaliability great. But the AA redemption rate is like $250k round trip, and poking around on here leads me to believe I could get it for much less with programs like QANTAS or Japan air. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was told the next best way to find out if it could be booked on travel partners was looking on British Airways and it says nothing-but American says the reward availability is there! On BA doesnt even show things flying there. I see nothing on the QANTAS website, and would be open to calling if BA said it had anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

awardtravel,"So my fiancée and I are getting married in September but due to it being a busy time of year at work for both of us, we are planning to take our honeymoon in May 2024, about 2-2.5 weeks split between Greece and Italy. Though I am not incredibly experienced with award travel, my goal is to get us J seats for both transatlantic legs at the very least. I realize this is a ""way too early"" post but I enjoy spending a lot of my time researching and I want to have a plan in place when awards start to release for this itinerary.

The bulk of my points are Cap1, with some on BILT as well. I'm not opposed to opening another card for SUB in the next couple of months though if it helps.

Our home airport is SFO, but my sister has her college graduation in end of April 2024 in Michigan so my hope is to find an outbound flight from DTW -&gt; ATH and a return from FCO -&gt; SFO (we'd also be open to doing Italy first, but have been planning on Greece then Italy for now). The outbound leg is the one I am having more trouble with, as I am more familiar with my options for SFO, but I will outline what I have managed to find below.

I'll detail the return flight first since it's simpler. My plan is FCO-&gt;IST-&gt;SFO on Turkish. I've heard their phone lines are annoying when booking for 2 but the point values are hard to pass up :) If anyone has alternative suggestions though, I'd be happy to hear them.

Now the outbound: Since DTW is hard Skyteam domain, I feel like it'll be tough to find awards through there. I've been looking for examples in ANY season of DTW-&gt;CDG, DTW-&gt;AMS, etc on FlyingBlue and Virgin but have had little luck finding reasonable options where there's availability at all. There is also a DTW-&gt;FRA on LH which I could easily use to connect to Athens but it's an A340 route which isn't particularly exciting. I also have a lower-than-normal tolerance to wait til the last minute since this is a honeymoon and not an average trip :) As a result, I've been looking at YYZ and ORD as alternative options. The nonstop YYZ-&gt;ATH AC flight is very appealing but I am not sure how much award availability there would be. There also appear to be some decent options for BA through LHR. As for ORD, I could probably do Turkish for that leg like the return flight or really any other Star Alliance partners booked through Aeroplan, Avianca etc.

ANY advice anyone has on this would be super appreciated! We're not opposed to making the whole round trip from SFO but it saves us a leg if we don't have to.

First time award travel redeemer here, and boy is it a doozy. I'm trying to plan a honeymoon in November or December or even January 2024 using the roughly 375,000 points we've amassed on Amex, Chase, and Cap One. 

The first destination choice was Australia, to get in 2-3 weeks of a mix of experiences, beach, city, nature explore. But between these threads, generic ""points guy"" site advice, and direct searches across Qantas, American, ANA, and Virgin Atlantic, finding availability for business/first class even this far out seems impossible. If anyone has advice on how to find that diamond in the rough to SYD, please let me know.

Otherwise, what I'd like to ask from this forum is advice for the BEST way to use (or methods to find the best way to use) these points for:

* Business/First seats flying out of LAX or SFO or Vancouver
* ANY 2-3 week span
* ANY destination(s) or regions (that's warm in the below months)
* A mix of experiences - beach, city explore, nature explore (so ideally not just an island destination)
* In November, December, or January

I understand that finding the award space can be tough, so trying to be as flexible as possible. As a first timer trying to maximize the use of these points, I could just use some direction in where/how to search and actually find success

I am looking at for the best scenario to redeem 12 economy, round trip tickets from US (CA) to Thailand in the summer for a funeral.

awardtravel,"Hi community! 

I've been a Asiana Diamond (Star Alliance Gold) Member for almost 4 years now as I started traveling much more for business. I used to live in Korea, now I live in Boston. I am thinking of migrating my awards program somewhere as I believe I will be making much more domestic flights in the US from now on and as a Star Gold member the benefits here are kind of bad :/ As Asiana is going to get merged with Korean Air, there is no point of me even trying to maintain status at Asiana anymore. I already qualify for Diamond for the next cycle and my current card expires May 2023. 

My main travel yearly are:

Korea - Bos: At least 2 round trips a year

And from here either from Korea or from Boston I travel to:

Shanghai: At least 1 round trip a year

Sri Lanka: At least 1 round trip a year

These are the guaranteed yearly travels on top of this I have some business travel and domestic travel. 

I buy the cheapest star alliance ticket available 100% of the time. And for Long flights I usually purchase business ticket upgrades if they are available. 

I am 200,000 miles away from becoming a lifetime diamond plus member. If Asiana wasn't getting a merger I was planning on doing mileage runs as I genuinely enjoy flying, I'm confident that I could probably reach that prior to the merger (which I hope is delayed indefinitely, I genuinely think Asiana is the greatest airline I travel on). 

I would ideally want to transfer to United, but I now they are really strict about how they handle transfers within star alliance :(

I am not really technically inclined about award programs and wanted to ask the community which would be the best program for me to transfer over to? Or if a transfer is not possible which program should I start over again with? Is there a possibility to use the news of the Asiana Korean Air merger to convince airlines to offer a challenge? I'm happy to fly to get into a program.",Asiana Awards Program Matching Before Merger,,gebnaim,,0,1/12/2023 9:10

I booked my trip through Amex FHR, which entitled me to a $100 credit at the property.

In the morning when I arrive to the desk there was a bit of an issue with figuring out how to refund my card. So I told the receptionist can you just give me points instead of trying to refund my card, she said that she will be able to do it and it would be 40,000 points credit to my Marriott account. I accepted the offer to me thats a great value.

I'm not a complete novice to award travel but my trips have taken a significant downturn since COVID.  I'm looking for a nine or ten day trip around the first week of September. September 1st through 10th or there abouts. I'm having no luck at all finding good value for Amex MR reward redemption. Bid take economy or business/first, but prefer the latter if there was good value...

For Lisbon, I don't see any way to get a non stop flight. TAPportugal is the only one that does it and I don't think there is a way to use MR points. For one stop, both economy/premium economy and business/first seem to come out in the 1 cent per point range or worse.  And then if be better off just buying the tickets or using amexs portal (economy obviously because I can't afford business class).  Am I missing something? 


Same goes for Copenhagen during the same dates. I see direct flights with SAS for reasonable $$ prices economy.  But using points to book with SAS comes out to the same points to dollar price plus I have to play taxes/fees on top.   Business/first class flights take a huge amount of points for direct flight (way worse than cent per point) and basically a cent per point (plus fees) for flights with one stop. 

I have plenty of MR Points (well over 500k) because I haven't had a chance to use them, but now I can't seem to find good value.

Some pertinent details:

* The wedding is in a small town south of Milan on the 20th of July. It'll take a half day to drive there. We'd like to arrive in Milan at least a few days ahead of the wedding so we have time to acclimate before driving to the festivities on the 18th. We need to be in the area the 19th – 22nd.
* We'd like to be in Europe for two weeks give or take a couple of days. We don't mind flying into our out of a different city, but flying into Milan would be ideal. I suppose could also end the trip with the wedding, but might be best to put it up front.
* We'd like nonstop flights, if possible. I want to try to keep things as easy, low-stress, and comfortable as possible for my partner.
* I know my partner would love to see Copenhagen, Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, or any Scandinavian country, so flying in or out of one of those places would be a bonus since we'd be able to divide the trip between the Italian wedding and our own getaway.

Business in a 2-2-2 configuration?

* Take the side 2 seats (window, aisle) + aisle seat directly across in the middle section? Where would the child sit?
* Take the middle 2 seats (aisle aisle) + aisle seat directly across to one side? Where would the child sit?

Business in a 1-2-1 configuration

* Take the middle 2 seats (aisle aisle) + window/aisle seat directly across to one side?Where would the child sit?
* Take the middle 2 seats (aisle aisle) + aisle seat directly front/behind? Where would the child sit?

Coach in a 3-4-3 configuration

* Take the side section with 3 seats together?
* Take the middle section with an extra seat hoping that is empty during the flight?
* Take 2 seats in the side section (window/aisle) hoping no one shows + aisle seat directly across?

I'm sure there are more scenarios and everyone has their opinions, and that's what I want to hear. Some other things to consider is the flight length, expected behavior of the child (lol, good luck with that wildcard), flight departure time (evening flight vs afternoon flight), and maybe even the specific carrier.","If points and counting redemption value were not a concern, what cabin would you fly as a family of 3?",,reyam1105,,0,1/11/2023 1:37
awardtravel,"Hi everyone,

I am getting married next summer and me and the fiancé have decided we want to get married in Thailand mostly to avoid a large wedding. Only people very close will get invited, however I do want to help family members out with their point usage in the process.

P1/P2 = me and the fiancé have around 250k UR a person. 
P3 = Brother has around 200k MR
P4/P5 = combined 500k MR

Dates are entirely open for us. I think ideal would be around March of 2024, however we literally have no date requirements and are equally open to summer months. I’d probably rather avoid monsoon season, but whatever.

We do not need to all fly together. Ideally me and the fiancé would be on the same plane, but at the end of the day nobody would mind much.

Off the top of my head Aeroplane seems like the easiest way to pull this off. It seems like for around 175k points you can book and there is a bit of availability floating around in 2023 - so I assume this would extend into 2024. 175k RT but I am having some issues finding availability of true business on the way back.

Chase Ultimate points 236,952
United 49,386

After doing some research, I saw that a good way to use the Chase and United points would be to transfer them to Virgin and then use them to book business class through ANA.  I have never flown business class, but I think it would be really cool to do so if possible.  I keep searching ANA and find no award availability, I have been checking other dates, March of 2024 is not yet showing.  I have read that the award travel opens up somewhere around a year in advance and sells out almost immediately.  We would be flying out of Portland, but I could fly to SEA or LAX if that would save points/money.

Hilton points 418,973

I planned on using these points for 4 nights at Conrad Tokyo when we first arrived.  I figured this would allow me to get the 5th night free as a diamond member.  It would also allow us a longer amount of time to explorer Tokyo and adjust as the first stop in our trip.  I have also heard great things about Conrad Osaka, but I am not sure if I want to spend 5 nights there.

I also have 20,029 Citi Thank You points, I know, not a ton there.

The plan is to leave late mid-late March, but the actual departure and return dates are flexible.  We are wanting the trip to be 16 days total, this way we can spend about 14 total days in Japan.

My plan so far is to fly into Tokyo, then go to Osaka, Kyoto, make the trip clear up to Sapporo, and then fly out of Tokyo.  I am also flexible on this.

We are potentially looking at moving this trip forward, but as you know, award availability is scarce. We'd specifically like to book BOS &gt; NRT nonstop. I've researched, and the 2-week close-in award availability for JAL looks pretty good actually.

THEN, book our return flight two weeks in advance *while on the trip?* The way back doesn't have to be nonstop, and I also saw plenty of award space for Tokyo &gt; back to Boston. 

My risky senses are tingling, and I have more questions: will we even be able to visit Japan without proof of return travel? Do I dummy-book return flights for visa requirements? What if we actually can't find award space while we are traveling? Is this too risky overall?

I understand that British airways is in the process of transitioning from an old international business class product, Club World, to a new one called Club Suites.

Hi - Any advice/input/thoughts would be helpful!

I am aware that I am doing this super last minute, we just didn't get confirmation of the time off until very recently. Of course, we don’t want to overpay on points when theres saver space, but understand that beggars can't be choosers, and we do have 800k+ chase points, and our schedule isn't so flexible.  Here's the legwork I've put in so far:

2 Adult Passengers, Business Class or better.  Overseas legs should be in biz.

Leaving San Francisco (SFO)

Feb 9,10(ideal),11. 

Arriving Back in SFO:

Feb 24,25,26(ideal/latest)

Basically two main destinations - Taiwan and Japan

* Taiwan. We may visit a few other cities via train, but understand we probably have to go back to TPE for international flights to Japan and/or back to SFO.
* Japan.  We want to travel between Tokyo and Osaka. It doesnt matter where we begin/end but we do want to do that open jaw..  So our airports are HND/NRT and KIX

It does not matter to us whether we start in Taiwan first or Japan first.  

For the TPE-&gt;Japan or Japan-&gt;TPE flights I figure I can deal with that later, and can fly in economy for these.  Priority for now is to get the long haul portions booked in Biz.

Here are my understanding based on my research, please correct me if I got any of this wrong

* For award flights, There is really only one airport (TPE) to search for, international flights.
* The three airports I should be focusing on in Japan are NRT, HND, and maybe KIX.

I signed up for both Point.me and AwardLogic, and have been searching these City Pairs:

**Outbound:**

* SFO-&gt;TPE
* SFO-&gt;NRT
* SFO-&gt;HND
* SFO-&gt;KIX

**Return:**

* TPE-&gt;SFO
* NRT-&gt;SFO
* HND-&gt;SFO
* KIX-&gt;SFO

**Best Combo I have found so far is**

* **Feb 11, 12:05PM China Airlines Business**
* **SFO-&gt; TPE 91K + $101 via Flying Blue**

**NRT/HND-&gt;SFO for 175K United Points on the Feb 24, 25, 26.**

The issue is once we got the card and were ready to book, the OWB rate went from $1100 to $1600/night for the dates we were planning on going (2/10 - 2/14).

We have 530k Chase UR points we could use but have a hard time justifying $1800/night after taxes. In addition, the general advice seems to be to transfer them to partners like airlines or hotels but don't see the logic in this as booking on points is 938k/night which is crazy. I know you often can't use status when booking via the Chase portal but is it worth losing the 50% bonus to get status or am I missing some other benefit of transferring them?

My question is would you postpone a once in a lifetime trip until next winter when rates are hopefully more reasonable or bite the bullet and spend $1600/night. This is for our honeymoon and staying in an OWB is a bucket list item. Our airfare (booked on 35k RT points) and other hotels are refundable, so we won't be out anything by cancelling.

2 adults, 2 children (age 4 and 6) Currently have 450k UR and 500k MR.

1) Chase portal -  depart **Asiana Airlines**  OZ 203, return **Asiana Airlines** **204.**   **373,984 points UR points.**

2) Amex portal -  depart **Asiana Airlines** **203** , return  **Asiana Airlines** **204.**   **553,180** MR points, so I'd be paying a little out of pocket on top.

awardtravel," 

I built an award search tool for planning my own trips, and thought it might be useful to others, you can find it at: [https://www.flightplantool.com](https://www.flightplantool.com/). It started as a set of scripts I open sourced, which is also available (if you're more tech saavy): [Github Repo](https://github.com/flightplan-tool/flightplan). The website is still a work in progress, but I figure better to launch early than never at all!

**What is it?** Yet another award search tool, but with a few twists. It combines data from many different sources (currently AC, CX, KE, NH, and SQ), and can return up to 365 days of results in under a second, using a cool radial calendar to visualize the results. That currently covers over 50 airlines, across the 3 major alliances. You can filter the resulting data to your heart's content, and everything updates in real-time. Supported filters includes cabins, whether awards are partner, mixed cabin, waitlisted, or saver, # of stops, which award program is offering the award, airline, aircraft, or specific flights.

**Why?** I built the original tool, after being frustrated with what was currently available. Because I was looking for high-demand F awards on popular routes for multiple passengers (traveling as a family of 7), manually searching was a time-consuming chore of searching different airline websites day-by-day, writing down results. I tried different award search tools, but I'd often find awards missing, since many airlines (such as SQ) don't release their premium awards to partners. Being able to only see a few days or a week at a time was limiting too, and still required me to collate the data by hand to get a bigger picture. So I set out to build my ideal award search engine.

**What's Next?** There's still a lot more coming, so stay tuned! Some things already planned:

* Support for more airline websites, there's a couple already in the pipeline and coming soon.
* Award Pricing: I'm sure most of us know how to use the award charts to figure out pricing, but it will be very convenient to have this built-in, and it's also coming soon.
* Coverage and Freshness: There are still a lot of routes missing data, which is gradually being overcome. Also some award results are getting stale (up to 6 weeks old at this point). Once coverage is a bit more under control, I’ll be going back and updating the more popular routes regularly.",Flightplan: Instantly search 365 days of award inventory,,GrumpyConsist,,0,1/9/2023 13:18

TLDR - Chase email says I can use credit until May 2023, phone representatives say February 2023. How do I get Chase to honor what their email confirmation said? 

I cancelled a flight that I had booked using Chase Ultimate Rewards points on Alaska Airlines back in May 2022. When I cancelled, the policies said I had one year from the date of planned travel to use my travel credit (which would be May 15, 2023). Few minutes later I got an email confirmation also stating the same. Now, when I am trying to rebook a trip, the phone representatives are telling me the travel must be completed by February 19, 2023 (one year from initial booking date).   
 

I've already booked a non refundable hotel stay in March and I was planning on using the flight credit to rebook. When talking to the Chase travel representatives, they are basically saying ""sorry, that email is wrong. You still have only until February 19, 2023 to travel even though the email says May 15, 2023."" Surely, Chase must honor the initial communication, they can't just change their policy after issuing me a travel credit and confirming over email that it's valid until May but now suddenly say it's only until February.

We’ve validated the fair rules and it’s wildly clear that these are nonrefundable tickets, and they don’t qualify for any of their Covid policies due to the purchase date. However the itinerary that was supplied to us identified the airfare as refundable. So when we call the “travel agency” that actually purchased the tickets, they are trying to tell us that it’s refundable for a $200 fee per ticket. We can find no mention of this fee on any reputable site and even AA states that they are no longer refunding non-refundable tickets. Doing some slight googling, it appears that their are some “less than reputable” looking agencies that are somehow offering the same $200 refund on a non-refundable ticket. Does anybody out there have any incite into this? Our working theory is that the travel agency mislabeled the itinerary as refundable instead of non-refundable and are just misrepresenting the $200 as trying to recover some funds from the lost ticket amount that they would typically be out.

awardtravel,"So with the deadline approaching for the Hyatt card's double-night promo (last day to apply is Thurs 9/30 for stays through 12/31), I thought I'd share my experiences with the program over the last decade.

I figured there's probably still some folks out there on the fence about whether a 13-night mattress run to Globalist is worth it... hopefully this helps a bit. Or if you're new to Hyatt this year thanks to the Q1 pandemic promo / half-tier requirements, hopefully this will be a good primer on the ins and outs of the program.

Bit of background on me - I've been with Hyatt since 2010, back when Globalist was still Diamond and Hyatt was handing out free night certificates after every two stays (2008 recession). I was traveling a lot for work then, so also had SPG/Marriott Platinum, Hilton Diamond, United 1K, etc.

Of all the programs, Hyatt has been the one I've kept top-tier status with continuously over the last 10 years. Despite only really traveling for fun nowadays, I've found Globalist status to be worth the effort/cost of maintaining out of pocket.

So just a disclaimer - I'm definitely biased in favor of Hyatt lol. I'd argue with good reason, but in the end I'm just one guy, so everything below is my anecdotal experience... ymmv.

Sorry this turned out to be quite long... maybe grab a coffee/doughnut 🤓

Globalist vs Glob Lite

Thanks to all the crazy promos this year, this seems to be a hot topic of debate (even more so than in previous years), so I figured I'd start here.

I've been all forms of Globalist. Full-revenue 60+ nights, 20-night corporate status challenge, 13-night pandemic promo. Last year (or I guess, 2019), I qualified as a ""full"" globalist with all my suite upgrade certs. For 2022/23, I re-qualified as a glob ""lite"" under the 13-night Q1 promo.

After hundreds of nights as both a full and a lite glob, I have personally not noticed a difference in hotel treatment. The only recognizable impact for me was the lack of confirmed suite upgrades, but that's it. My rate of success with complimentary suite upgrades has been consistently high, and I can't recall the last time I didn't at least receive the best room available (more on that later).

I'm fairly confident Hyatt hotel staff do not have access to your past stay records at other Hyatt hotels. It seems the reservation systems at each hotel is segregated; one hotel isn't able to review your stay records and guest notes from another hotel. Hyatt corporate feeds them some member data, but overall stay count and spend across the entire chain isn't one of them. There is definitely VIP coding, but even that tends to be done on a per-hotel basis rather than across the whole chain.

That said, I'm not sure if a General Manager or someone high enough up at the hotel has improved access and is able to review a member's full Hyatt profile. But even supposing they can, it doesn't appear anyone is proactively spending the time to do so in advance of your stay, just so they can prioritize upgrades for a full glob over a glob lite. More likely, they would just rank globs by how often they stay at their particular hotel.

But again, that's just my experience with it up til now. There are some rumors floating around that this may change in the future, where hotels might be given more access to see what kind of glob you are. But this topic comes up every once in a while on flyertalk, and I don't think anyone has been able to provide anything conclusive thus far. If you happen to have deep insight/screenshots of what the Hyatt front desk agent sees when you check in, please do share.

Complimentary suite upgrades

I'll skip over confirmed suite upgrade certificates (TSUs) since that's a pretty well-covered, established benefit. You shouldn't ever run into any problems on that front, and it works really well. If your only experience with confirmed suite upgrades are Marriott SNAs... prepare to be amazed.

I'll also skip over room upgrades. I'm pretty much at a 100% success rate in receiving at least the best room available at checkin (deluxe, club floor, corner room, etc). And usually, these are preassigned before arrival/check-in, so no effort needed on your end.

The part that sometimes does require a bit of work though is the complimentary suite upgrades. When there are standard suites available, around half the time I'm upgraded to the suite without any work on my end. And maybe 1 in 10 times, I'm upgraded ABOVE the standard suite, but I think that mostly happens out of luck (eg. the hotel oversold the standard suite).

The other half of the time when I'm not proactively upgraded to a suite, I'd estimate my success rate in securing it at check-in to be somewhere above 90% (when there is one showing in the app). This may seem high to some folks, but I probably do a couple of things that sometimes people overlook (and no, screaming DYKWIA at the front desk agent is not one of them 😂).

The biggest thing that has worked well for me is simply asking nicely. For sure, as a globalist, you are entitled to the standard suite that is showing in the app. But too often I see people being rude and acting entitled about it. It's possible to both ask for your upgrade and still be a nice person to the front desk staff. A simple ""any chance you would be able to upgrade us to a suite"", along with a friendly smile, has worked for me the majority of the time.

Of course, I do wish front desk would be more proactive and just do it without any prompting. But so it goes, and it's really not that much effort on my end for a pretty big improvement in comfort/value.

I think also sometimes people have the opposite problem of being rude, and are instead embarrassed or have anxiety about asking for things like upgrades. If that's you, my advice would be to just keep it chill and maybe practice a few times elsewhere. Like next time you pick up a pizza, try practicing ""any chance I could get a couple extra ranch dressings?"". Over time, it'll feel more natural.

I know this might all sound kinda stupid or obvious, but you'd be surprised by reading some flyertalk comments. It's pretty easy to find someone complaining about how they weren't proactively given an upgrade at check-in, then quietly seethed their whole trip because they felt they were shortchanged. And did they ask? Of course not, they should have been upgraded without asking, damnit.

And for the more anxious/proactive folks, another tip for upgrades is to ask ahead of time via email. Same rules apply - be nice, be chill. Just a short, simple email to the room manager along the lines of -

""My wife and I are checking in next week, [it's our first time in Seattle] and we're really excited for our stay. [We're checking in a bit late], so I was wondering if there's any chance you would be able secure us an upgrade to [suite type] ahead of time? Thanks for anything you can do.""

Obviously replace the brackets with your situation, but this works for me maybe 50% of the time. Not bad considering it only takes a few minutes to send and to read, and I only do it when I'm seeing standard suites available.

But again, ymmv. A complimentary pre-arrival upgrade into a suite isn't technically a globalist benefit. But imo, as long as you're nice and keep it short, there's no harm in trying. The worst that happens is your email is ignored or they say no.

Room and revenue managers are people too, and most want their guests (particularly their globalists) to be happy. So if they can do something a little extra for you (and you don't come across like an entitled ass), they'll often try.

Free Breakfast

The pandemic wreaked havoc on pretty much every loyalty program's free brekkie benefit, but Hyatt seems to have tried the least hard to turn the situation into an excuse to diminish the benefit as a whole and reduce costs.

For example, Marriott has updated their terms to only provide continental breakfast for elites, which often does not include a hot dish or buffet access. While some Marriotts are doing better than that, the fact that they have over 7,000 hotels means it's really at the whim of each property. Marriott has made it clear they have no desire to try and enforce these rules beyond giving you a bit of compensation if you complain.

Hilton isn't faring much better - they have a small enough footprint to enforce consistency, but they consistently choose to enforce it downwards. The free breakfast benefit has been replaced with a $15 per person food credit across all US Hiltons. When a breakfast often costs $60+ after tax and tip for two, it's a pretty big downgrade.

Thankfully, Hyatt's breakfast benefit is still mostly intact. You'll get access to the same breakfast as other guests, not a separate, crappier breakfast made for elites. And at most Hyatts, the dollar amount is still uncapped. That said, with COVID, a few hotels have started introducing breakfast vouchers with specific dollar amounts on them, but at least for now it seems to be the minority and definitely not a Hyatt-wide policy.

Guest of Honor

This is probably my favorite benefit. As a Globalist, you can use points to book a stay for any other person with a Hyatt account. And during their stay, they will receive all of your Globalist benefits - free breakfasts, room/suite upgrades, 4pm late checkout. It costs you nothing to do this, and you can book as many of these as you want.

Additionally, there are no limits to how many points you can transfer between members, the only rule being you can only receive points once every 30 days.

So in this year alone, I've received almost a million Hyatt points from friends and family who want me to book their Hyatt stays for them. You do have to call in to book these GoH stays, but with Hyatt's stellar customer service (see below), these calls usually only take a few minutes.

I don't think any other chain has anything like this, and for me it really does set Hyatt apart. And it's a great marketing move on Hyatt's part. They're essentially showing the best of Hyatt to people who would otherwise probably never stay at a Hyatt. But thanks to the Guest of Honor program, I've essentially converted everyone I know into Hyatt fanboys. I've got family going out of their way now to vacation in places with Hyatts, and some have even started working on status themselves.

Customer service

IMO this is the most underrated part of Hyatt. I've probably made hundreds of calls over the years and have never once had to wait on hold. 9 times out of 10, I'm connected with a competent phone agent who can resolve my issue in a few minutes (missing points/stays/nights, securing suite upgrades, booking Guest of Honor, etc).

The few times where I've gotten a new agent who didn't know how to do something, hanging up and calling back usually fixed it. There's also Hyatt's Twitter Concierge, who can help make tougher bookings, like when a hotel is playing games with award inventory (cough... Andaz Maui).

Contrast that with Marriott, where before every call, you gotta remember to anoint yourself with holy oils and summon the ancient mayan goddess of fortune. And even then, you only slightly increase your odds of getting an agent who knows how to use their shipwreck of an IT system, isn't having a bad day, doesn't have an attitude, doesn't hang up on you, doesn't accidentally cancel your entire reservation/certificate...

Seriously though, the countless hours I've wasted (and the buckets of sweat I've lost) calling Marriott, then calling and recalling Marriott to fix the thing the first agent messed up. If I had a Hilton point for every second I've wasted... well, I still wouldn't have enough Hilton points to book a room 😂

Points Value

On the topic of points - Hyatt has done an amazing job over the years of maintaining the value of their loyalty program. Unlike Hilton, where your points are literally worth less every year thanks to their steady pace of devaluations and dynamic pricing, Hyatt has limited inflation.

For example, back in 2010, a category 6 (the top-tier back then) Park Hyatt cost 22K points. Today, 11 years later, Park Hyatts still cap out at category 7 for 30K points.

Marriott hasn't gone as crazy as Hilton, but only because their biggest devaluation happened already with the SPG merger. Once upon a time, SPG points were worth more than Hyatt points. But post- Bonvoy, a Marriott point is worth at least 3 times less than a Hyatt point.

Which makes the Chase Ultimate Rewards 1:1 point transfer ratio a particularly bad deal when transferring to Marriott. But their 1:1 transfer to Hyatt is quite good, and with the ease of acquiring Chase points through all their various credit card signup bonuses (2 types of Sapphire, 3 types of Business Ink), this just makes Hyatt even more attractive.

I routinely book Category 7 Hyatt properties that go for over $2K / night (Park Hyatt Niseko, Ventana Big Sur, to name a couple), for just 30K Chase/Hyatt points. That translates into more than 6 cents / point, compared to the 1.25 cpp Chase reimburses you when booking on their travel portal.

Marriott's Category 8 can cost as much as 100K points... an incredible waste of Chase or Amex points. Hilton doesn't really even have an award chart anymore thanks to dynamic pricing... the sky's the limit there lol.

Hyatt's Footprint

This is probably the biggest complaint people have against Hyatt (myself included). Of the major chains, they are one of the smallest, with only 1,000 or so hotels. That number is steadily increasing thanks to some recent acquisitions, but it's still no match for Marriott's coverage.

For better or worse, my loyalty to the Hyatt program has shaped my travel patterns over the last decade. My wife and I have gone to places purely because there was an amazing hyatt there (eg. Maldives, Niseko, Big Sur, etc.), and we've skipped over entire countries due to a lack of Hyatt.

For us, this hasn't been a big deal - there are plenty of countries that are still both on our bucket list and have Park Hyatts. But if you have a specific country in mind, this can be a problem if you're trying to stay within the program. It's becoming less of an issue lately with Hyatt's purchase of the Small Luxury Hotels collection, which fills in quite a few gaps in Europe, but it's still an issue.

So it really comes down to deciding whether all the benefits are enough to outweigh this one major deficiency in the program. For us, all the upgrades and free nights have been worth it, but obviously ymmv.

---

Alright, I'm probably close to hitting reddit's word limit so I'll cut it off here lol. All of this to say, I think Globalist is well worth the effort/cost, especially at 13 nights... you can hit that for as little as 65K pts or ~$750 if you have a Cat 1 Hyatt nearby. Keep in mind we probably won't see another offer like this until the next recession/variant hits, so its really now or never.

awardtravel,"My husband and I currently have \~120k points with our Chase Sapphire card and don't fly frequently enough to have any loyalty to any airline and have never really tried to play the game with flights before. We do have about 10k miles with United (lol) but that's it.

We saw there's a nonstop 9hr flight from Denver to London with United (UA 262, UA 263 or UA 26) leaving May 6 and returning May 26 (actual dates for trip are flexible); right now it's $717 for basic economy. We'd then get an Iberia flight or easyJet etc. to Spain and are not worried about pricing and figuring those out. If there is a good flight directly into Spain that would be great, but it seems like flights to London are drastically cheaper.

Our priorities for the trip:

* Flight time; we're definitely not interested in any long layovers and would love to keep the time from Denver to London under 13 hours.
* Cost/points redemption; I want to stretch our points/miles are far as possible to then spend as little cash as possible.
* 10-15 days once we are in Europe.
* Upgrades would be nice to have but not necessary; we normally fly Frontier since DIA is a Frontier hub, so it'd be nice to have comfortable seats for our honeymoon. However, I don't think it's worth it to us if we're still paying $1000+ RT for each of us to fly business class after redeeming points/miles.

Does anyone have suggestions for where to start? I've heard that Iberia can have great business class trans-Atlantic deals but I haven't been able to find any actual deals on their booking portal. Would it be worth it to get the United Visa and get 100k miles since they have the nonstop flight option?

I'm aware that Alaska lets you add a stopover for free on these sorts of flights, and I would like to add a connection to New Zealand. Normally if I would be booking the whole itinerary at once I would do this using the ""Multi City"" option on the booking portal. It seems that the modify flight option on Alaska's website doesn't really show the same Multi City UI. I was wondering what the right way was to modify the booking to include the free stop over.

1) If I cancel the award reservation and try to re-book the new one, will the award availability that I cancelled be instantly re-added to the system so that I can re-book the complete itinerary I'm looking for? I'm hesitant to cancel and then have the availability not show up again when I try to re-book.

Well as some of you know there have been massive storms in Northern California, so bad that they closed Highway 1 by Big Sur.  So I called the hotel and asked what our options were and they said that due to the circumstances they were allowing guests an exemption to rebook for another date but since I used points it had to be done by Hyatt.

So they transferred me to Hyatt who were actually pretty helpful and found me another weekend and started to process the change.  Unfortunately they weren’t able to finalize it because the new cost was 40k points per night, so 25k more than what I had booked for.  I explained to them that they should honor what I booked it for since this is an extraordinary situation that is completely out of my control.  CSR actually agreed and ran it up the chain and the supervisors agreed as well but needed executive approval.  I explained that my travel plans were tomorrow so I kinda needed to know what to do.

They then got back in touch with the hotel and the hotel manager gave them two options.  They would waive the 14 day cancellation fee and just refund my points or I could pay more for the new dates.  They would not honor the rate I originally booked for.  So I looked at availability and the date they were originally going to switch me to was gone.  Everything else was full price (45k points).  And as a final kick in the nuts, they had actually already cancelled my booking so now our anniversary trip is gone and I have no reservation at all.

I was able to book another ANA RTW trip for the fall of 2023. It was kind of just booked on a whim so it didn't have usual planning I put into it. The girl I am dating was going to be in Vietnam during September and some friends are going to Germany for Oktoberfest so it just seemed like a good idea to try to book a RTW. Anyway here are the flight details. The first flight is in the first week of September and the return is in October. Everything is in business class.

|Destination|Route|Carrier|Stay|Aircraft|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Japan|ORD-HND|ANA|4 nights|77W|
|Vietnam|HND-HAN|ANA|14 nights|788|
|Thailand|SGN-SIN-BKK|Singapore Airlines|2 nights|a359, 787|
|Germany/Central Europe|BKK-AMS|EVA Air|12 nights|77W|
|USA|ZRH-BOS|Swiss Air|home|a333|

Total cost: **115,000 MR points** and **$662**

* I got lucky finding the available flights fairly quickly. I didn't put more than an hour into trying to build the itinerary. It helps knowing the routes that ANA and EVA have between HND/NRT/TPE and the US because it pretty much is the only way you are going to get to Asia from the US (outside of the random UA flight and I haven't seen an Asiana flights in the last 2 bookings). 
* Finding the return flight from Europe was really quite difficult. This Swiss Air flight and a couple of LOT flights were the only ones I found for the first 2 weeks of October.
* I transferred 125K but only ended up using 115k points. Took 24 hours exactly from Amex to ANA.
* Wait time was about an hour on the phone and I called midnight est. But the Japanese rep was as nice, helpful, and efficient as always. 
* I know EVA air has stops in BKK on their TPE-AMS and TPE-VIE routes which is an awesome way to save money on fees and get a superior J product from Thailand to Europe.
* I know the SGN-SIN-BKK flight might not be the most efficient but flying on SQ is always a treat and spending a few hours at the Chiangi Airport is pretty fun.
* Excited to finally fly in The Room.

Just curious as to what people would do with roughly 259K TruBlue points. Me and P2 had hopes to go to London in Mint and did SUB with the Jetblue cards. Just a little information. Based out of ORD. Would take positioning flights as necessary. London in Mint still an option but wondering if

1. Use them to go to Hawaii with Hawaiian air. We would go to west coast airports (LAS, LAX, etc). But unsure if J for those flights is worth it. West coast flights being roughly 6 hours or so.
2. Save them to hopefully go to London or possibly wherever Jetblue goes for next Europe expansion. Just shy of being able to buy 2 mint one way and wouldn't be able to do round trip in J.
3. Bank on the Northwest Alliance with AA moving forward and being able to use TruBlue on AA. Maybe being naïve on this one but AA allows points to be used for JetBlue flights and both companies state that it will be coming for using TruBlue for AA. But the big if and issue is that the DOJ still has their antittrust suite against the alliance.

I'm trying to book flights from either SEA or SFO to Milan or Rome and returning from either Venice or Naples to SEA. The dates are 6/15 or 6/16 - 7/1 or 7/2. Would prefer nonstop or 1 stop. 

If flying into Rome then the departing flight would need to be from Naples. If flying into Milan then the departing flight would need to be from Venice. 

If leaving from SEA - ideally I would want to book for 6/15 after 8PM and arriving 6/16. I realize this may not be feasible after searching through different carriers' availability, but maybe I'm missing something. Otherwise, flying out of SEA on 6/16 is fine as long as we can leave as early as possible to land in FCO/MIL/LIN as early as possible. We can also fly out of SFO on 6/16, preferably early morning so we can arrive as early as possible in FCO/MIL/LIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant point banks: Chase \~300k, Amex \~400k, Air France \~60k, HH \~600k, Hyatt \~84k, Marriott \~174k

\*Note: would prefer to book direct with the airline for better protections, but willing to book through Chase portal if it's the best option at this point. Not bothering with Amex portal because the few itineraries I looked up were much more expensive than going through Chase.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I have found so far:

&amp;#x200B;

* **SEA-FCO // NAP-SEA departing 6/15 returning 7/1 or 7/2**

1. United - Would arrive 6/17. Total cost 380k miles for 2 RT flights with 2 stops on both the departing and returning legs. 
2. Chase UR - Arrive 6/16 PM. Total 282k UR with 1 stop each way.
3. BA, Iberia, Delta, Air Canada, Air France, AA all showed no availability 

&amp;#x200B;

* **SEA-FCO // NAP-SEA departing 6/16 returning 7/1 or 7/2**

1. United - Arrive 6/17. Total 280k miles with 2 stops on each leg.
2. Air Canada - Arrive 6/17 but late in the day for the cheapest option which comes out to 238k points with 2 stops on each leg. 
3. Delta - Arrive 6/17. Total 800k miles - only premium select available. 
4. Chase UR - Arrive 6/17. Total 232k-265k UR depending on 1 or 2 stops.
5. AA - no availability 

 

* **SFO-FCO // NAP-SEA departing 6/16 returning 7/1 or 7/2**

1. United - Arrive 6/17. 475.2k miles. 1 stop each leg. Could be cheaper but the early departing flights from SFO are much more expensive.
2. Air Canada - Arrive 6/17. Total 367k points. 1 stop departing, 2 stops returning.
3. Chase UR - Arrive 6/17. Total 232k-283k UR, 1-2 stops.
4. Air France - Arrive 6/17 late in day. Total 190k miles ***one way*** SFO-FCO..
5. Delta - 560k+ miles
6. AA - no availability 

&amp;#x200B;

* **SEA-MXP/LIN // VCE-SEA departing 6/15 returning 7/1 or 7/2**

1. Chase UR - 197k-220k UR depending on 1 or 2 stops and duration of stops.
2. United - Arrive 6/17 early afternoon. Total 280k miles, 1 stop each way.
3. Delta no availability. 
4. AA - no availability

&amp;#x200B;

* **SEA-MXP/LIN //VCE-SEA departing 6/16 returning 7/1 or 7/2**

1. Chase UR - 189k-202k UR depending on stops/duration.
2. Delta - Arrive 6/17 late. Total 380k-500k miles.
3. United - Arrive 6/17. Total 280k miles, 1 stop
4. AF - 169k miles ***one way***
5. AA - 243k miles

&amp;#x200B;

* **SFO-MXP/LIN // VCE-SEA departing 6/16 returning 7/1 or 7/2**

1. United - Arrive 6/17 AM. Total 280k miles with 2 stops on the way in, 1 stop on the way out
2. Chase UR - Arrive 6/17 AM. Total 177k UR with 1 stop each way.
3. Delta - Arrive 6/17 AM. Total 560k miles
4. Iberia - no availability
5. AA - 252k miles

Is it too late now to find a decent redemption for this route? Are there ever decent redemptions for this route? What other carriers should I look at? I didn't have much luck with Iberia and BA at all so I didn't check them for every single route.

It will be with AA miles partnered with Japan Airlines. I postponed the trip 10 times (!) because of covid travel restrictions, and American Airline was really cooperative each time, helping me reschedule, with no extra fees these past few years.

While in the U.S. I want to make a side-trip to St. Louis for a week and so reserved a trip starting April 10th, round-trip from Boston to STL. I was able to make the reservation and it's on hold until January 9th until I decide for sure.

What surprised me though was the miles needed for the small domestic trip. The international trip is 70,000 miles for economy (though my total is a bit more because return is business class). That seemed ok. The tiny (by comparison) domestic trip is 50,000 miles round trip! It seems disproportionately high. It is non-stop though, at a reasonable time of day.

I did notice that the miles needed also seemed to go up on the calendar as you moved from January to February, March, and April.

Is 50,000 miles a pretty typical amount for a BOS-STL round trip in April? I'm wondering whether to use most of my remaining miles on that or just look for an inexpensive paid-for ticket on some other airline.

I am currently searching point.me every morning and night for flights from 23 European cities over those three days.  My browser is not thrilled with this and has crashed a few times...and it would love a break if the chances are near zero that we'll find four seats.  

We are currently booked on United in J to Frankfurt (for 66k miles/$25) for our outbound flight and then on AA in PE (72k AA miles/$55 taxes) for our return.  Definitely happy with these given that J flights back from Europe are looking to be a minimum of 122k miles/points and those are for less-than-ideal routing and $400+ in fees.  

So this is really just to see if there is a chance of getting J on the return segment for under 80k and how much time to spend on searching.  Or are we just past the window and it's time to turn the OCD off.  

Is the only hope at this point that people cancel their seats and/or the airline releases more space?  If it's the former then it seems that it's highly unlikely since we need four seats.  If it's the latter, should I just pause on searching and then start again a month before the flight?

awardtravel,"Background: I’ve got \~730k MR points and \~645k UR points, and I am looking to travel J to JNB or CPT with my soon to be wife for our honeymoon. Currently located in the Philadelphia area, and am willing to travel to EWR or JFK (or have stopover really anywhere within the US). Travel dates are flexible and targeting leaving the US anytime between June 14 and July 3rd to travel for roughly 15 days. I have never redeemed my points for flights/trips, and want to make sure I am getting the best value for my points if possible.

Trip details: My tentative plan is to stay 2-3 days in Cape Town (paid with either MR or UR points), 2-3 days at Babylonstoren (winery outside of Cape Town, paid with cash/credit), 4 days at Londolozi (private game reserve on Kruger National Park, paid with cash/credit), and 4-5 days on Zanzibar (targeting the new Park Hyatt, using 20k UR points per night). 

Research/work to date: I’ve searched [point.me](http://point.me/), cowtool, award hacker, checked both Amex and Chase travel portals, and read through some old posts on here. 

From the work I’ve done, I’ve come away with a few different redemption options to get to South Africa (I will worry about return after) and I am curious to see others opinions:

Out of PHL:

1. [Point.me](http://point.me/) \- Either United Airlines (95k or 125k points per person one way) or Delta (247.5k points per person one way). United routes through EWR/ORD/IAH and Delta routes through ATL. Shortest trip is \~ 20 hours, longest is \~ 48 hours.
2. Cowtool - 110k points per person one way plus \~ $95 in fees. Only options are through Ethiopian Airlines, which I want to avoid. Am I right to avoid Ethiopian Airlines?

Out of EWR:

1. [Point.me](http://point.me/) \- United (95k or 125k points per person one way), Delta (247.5k points per person one way), Air France or KLM (412.5k points per person one way + $400.00). United has a 15 hour nonstop, which is attractive but I’d rather use MR points for these flights. Shortest trip is \~ 15 hours, longest is \~ 48 hours. 
2. Cowtool - 110k points per person one way plus \~ $95 in fees. Most options are through Ethiopian Airlines (see above), other options are through Egypt Air, but trip duration is at least 42 hours. 

Out of JFK: 

1. [Point.me](http://point.me/) \- United (95k or 125k points per person one way), Virgin Atlantic on 6/14/2023 (52.5k points per person one way plus $264.50 per person), Turkish (100k points per person one way plus $215.00 per person), EgyptAir on 6/17 (55k points per person one way plus $31.00 per person, has a 13.5 hour layover that could possibly allow us to explore).
2. Cowtool - 110 points per person one way plus \~ $95 in fees. Options are either Etihad or EgyptAir.

I can’t decide between:

* Direct flight out of EWR for 95k UR points per person one way (total of 380k UR points). I planned to use \~ 200k UR points to cover hotels in Cape Town and Zanzibar. 
* Virgin Atlantic flight on 6/14/2023. Flight definitely conserves most of my miles, and I’ve heard Virgin Atlantic is nice. 
* Egypt Air flight on 6/17/2023. Flight conserves most of my miles with the lowest fees. Would a 13.5 hour layover be enough time to go and see the periods and get back to the airport?

Additional details

1. I’d really like to use MR points to cover these flights instead of UR if possible.
2. I am open to postponing the trip a full year and trying to redeem for better value for June 2024 if it makes sense. I was really hoping to travel Qatar Q-suites but I think from my research and given how late I am to the game, it won’t be possible to redeem any points for a Q-suites trip to SA.

I have a flight coming up from EWR, a United flight leaving from Terminal C. I want to check out a lounge, but I'm wondering if it's worth the trip. For context, I have:

* Amex Platinum
* C1 Venture X

When I checked the relevant lounge portals, it seems like there are really only lounge I can access in Terminal B, which can only be accessed via air train.

The issue is, I have a checked bag, so I'm assuming I need to go through Terminal C so that my bag properly gets loaded?

Given the known impossibility of getting the ANA / Virgin business class redemption for much fewer points, I am thinking about biting the bullet and dropping 420k points to fly 2 people to Tokyo (175k each business there, 35k each economy back) to at least enjoy one business class leg to start the trip.

Obviously 175k per person for one way business is painful when it is technically possible to get for 95k, but it comes with basically no fee ($105 all-in) and I can pick the dates which is a huge win.

Being a total newbie to using points in general, I have been collecting Asia Miles for the past couple of months using different credit cards in the hopes of bumping my numbers up and getting some value with Cathay. My goal is to use points to upgrade my long haul flights from Asia to Europe every once in a while.   
I actually checked out the procedure to use points for upgrading just now and I was amazed by the prices you still would have to pay to get a decent upgrade. Example: say I want to use points to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business. I would need \~40k points for a one-way. Furthermore, I would need to book a Premium Economy (PE) seat as you can only upgrade one class up. However, not all PE tickets are eligible for upgrade via Asia Miles. I checked out some sample flights and while a standard (2-way) PE ticket to Europe would be \~13k HKD (1.6k USD), a PE ticket eligible for upgrade would cost around 28k HKD (3.5k USD).   
Is there something I'm missing here? Are loyalty programs always like this? I mean, the value is just utterly low - if I had known this, I might as well have not spent time, money and effort into earning Asia Miles. There is *some* kind of value in buying Economy tickets and upgrading to PE, but I would have never guessed that upgrading from PE to Business would be so costly (buying a business ticket directly would be around 4.5k USD)..",Question about value Asia Miles x Cathay Pacific,,holzenhaus,,0,12/31/2022 16:52

Looking for: 

\- Nice (ideally somewhat secluded) beach

\- Not a massive property, if possible. Would love something less than 200 units. Honestly the smalle the better.

\- No need for any family friendly amenities. We don't have kids, but expect they will be around, but will generally avoid more family friendly properties when we can. 

\- Good food/restaurants.

It seems like a lot of the best IHG properties are in Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Pacific Islands, etc.). We know this would be a longer flight so probably less ideal, but we're not 100% opposed to lengthening the trip to half beach/half city if the timing worked out. We stayed at the W Punta Mita last year and absolutely loved it. Would love to replicate something similar-ish.  

Haven't looked at any of the Iberostar properties just yet. Not available for a points stay yet anyways, it seems.

\- Hotel Indigo Bali Seminyak Beach

\- HI Maldives - 60k. 150ish units.

awardtravel,"Hello,

I recently opened up a chase reserve card and would like to book The Room shown on YouTube tomorrow. The problem is I am seeing no ANA availability on the Delta portal.

I’m flying out of El Paso Texas and would like a direct flight tomorrow to HND which comes back on January the 10th exactly. No exceptions. I would consider flying into Narita, but I’ve heard the train isn’t an enjoyable experience so I will need you guys to book me direct to HND.

Also I would like it if perhaps the flight attendants could gently tuck me in at night and possibly caress my balls as I fall asleep. No exceptions.

Should I transfer all of my points to Delta today? I’m going to go ahead and do it while one of you finds me a direct flight

I was able to find two business class British Airways tickets for BOM-LHR-SFO for 140k AA miles + $1550 and have put them on hold via the AA website until Jan 4th. My plan was to transfer AMEX MR to AA and use those for the redemption but I just realized that I can‘t transfer AMEX MR to AA Advantage (I know, I know, I should’ve checked before but the upside is that I haven’t paid for the ticket, just put it on hold). Given that AMEX MR can be transferred to BA Avios, I then checked if the award flight was available via BA’s website but it is not showing up there. 

I was wondering if the award flight will show up on the BA website once I cancel my “on hold” ticket with AA -  I would then book using Avios points provided the redemption value via BA is same/better. 

Alternatively, I was considering applying for the AAdvantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard today for my wife and I, in the hopes that we would each get the ‘60k miles bonus miles after first purchase‘ prior to Jan 4th and use those for the redemption. Worst case scenario I can release the hold from my AA account on Jan 3rd and put the same tickets on hold for 4 more days via my wife’s AA account (not sure if this is actually possible) to buy us more time to get the bonus miles.

I'm looking to travel to Japan in late February or early March 2024 and I am starting to think ahead for travel there, and one of things I'd like to do is to travel there by flying ANA F or J with points (which has been a bucket list item of mines for quite some time). I understand that award availability for ANA F or J seats are made available between 335 and 355 days before the travel date, and that award availability for those seats are limited.

To start, my home base is IAD and I plan to transfer up to 93K MR to Virgin Atlantic and take advantage of the 30% transfer bonus so I have enough points in hand to book ANA F or J when the time comes.

Now I have a few questions:

* 1. As I understand it, ANA's first class product (The Suites) is only available on certain routes/planes. I did a cursory search on United's website and it appears that the JFK-HND/JFK-NRT route has the plane that carries that hard product (Boeing 777-300ER). Is it worth a ferry flight from IAD/DCA to JFK so that I could fly on ANA F, should I get lucky with award availability for that?
* 2. Should I choose to fly out of my home base (IAD), it appears that ANA only flies the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner on the IAD-HND route, which only offers business class. Of course, flying out of IAD would be convenient for me. But is it worth experiencing J on the Dreamliner?

For the next couple years, I'll be traveling from Chicago to Asia (12k-14k flight miles roundtrip) for business, multiple times in a year (economy mostly). It looks like my best option is to fly direct with EVA or ANA. I want to maximize my flights to earn either \*A Gold or the most miles I can use for future award flights.

Case for Asiana:

* Need to earn 40k miles in 2 years and will get \*A Gold for 2 years;
* Will likely fly enough in 2 years to earn;
* Not as familiar with Asiana's redemptions for their miles and also the pending merger with Korean Air; 

Case for United:

* Likely won't fly enough to earn enough PQP on partner flights (750 per leg at most) for UA status, at best maybe Silver (3500 PQP needed);
* More likely to use UA miles to book award flights.

There's also the choice of flights - if I have 2 equally viable options that have legs that are either a mix of Lufthansa and United or with exclusively Lufthansa (or even exclusively United, but I haven't seen this yet) then which of these would be preferable and why?

I currently have:

1. 150k IG Points
2. 57k Hyatt Points
3. 120k UR Points

I've been reading through tons of threads here, and I have a list of potential options to book with each of the cards, but I'm struggling to balance it all properly.

We get into Osaka at night on the 22nd, so we're thinking of just staying at a hotel near the airport for the first night, then moving to a nicer / better location for the rest of the nights there. (The other option would be to go to the Hyatt Regency here for our first night)

Here is my rough outlined plan, but I'd love any feedback on hotel choices, use of points, the best number of nights in each city, other places we should potentially stay, etc.

Overall, we are planning on:

* 4 Nights in Osaka
* 5 Nights in Kyoto
* 4 Nights in Tokyo

(OSAKA - June 22): We arrive this day at night, so thinking of just staying somewhere near the airport (Maybe Hearton Hotel Shinsaibashi Nagahadouri), or doing one night at Hyatt Regency (8k Hyatt)

(KYOTO - June 26 - July 1): 5 Nights at ANA Crowne Plaza Kyoto (82k IHG)

I accepted a new job offer which will make me do around 6-7 round trip EU - US flights a year, and make around approx 50-70 domestic flights in the US throughout the year.

The only problem I have is that maybe half of those those 50-70 domestic will be delta since they don't always offer nonstop lines (I'd rather fly nonstop than chase my status with stops).

* We're traveling with 3 kids and grandma (we're a slow-moving party). Probably obvious, but we prefer one stop or direct, and 2hr+ layovers to account for delays.

1. Right now I'm looking for J availability every day using [point.me](https://point.me), checking about a half-dozen airports over 2 or 3 different days. **How else should I be looking?**
2. **Along those lines,** **when is the ideal time to look for J availability in summer '23?** Most options I find on [point.me](https://point.me) aren't in reach for us, and [seats.aero](https://seats.aero) isn't seeing availability that far out. Of course, needing 6 seats complicates things.
3. I booked our BA flights with my EC FF# (no status). **If I want oneworld Sapphire benefits, am I good to switch to my currently-Gold AA FF# now, or do I need to wait until I hit Platinum?**
4. We're not far from being able to book 4 BA J tickets using my AA account with Platinum status, and 2 BA J tickets using P2's AA account without Gold status. **Is the J experience significantly different for passengers with and without status?**","Requesting advice: first international redemption, CDG-SFO for 6 passengers",,thisfits,,0,12/22/2022 22:58
awardtravel,"Bit of a stupid Marriott-related question that I’m sure has been answered before, but I couldn’t seem to find the answer.

I had a Marriott reservation from 12/24-29 for which the window to penalty to cancel without penalty closed on 11/24. One of the people I was planning to travel with just tested positive for COVID so I called Marriott and they allowed me to move the reservation to February without a fee. The new reservation now says I can cancel without a penalty before 1/10/23.

My question is: Can I actually go ahead and cancel without a fee now? That seems like an obvious workaround in hindsight - seems like people would just always use this method to cancel reservations they couldn’t otherwise cancel without a fee?

awardtravel,"Hi all,
Now that the airline clubs require a boarding pass on one of their flights to access the club, I’m trying to expand my club access. Up to now I’ve focused on United via my United Club MileagePlus Chase credit card. Through work I’ll shortly be receiving an Amex Platinum card which will give me access to Delta and Centurion clubs. That leaves American as the last major hole to plug I think. Yearly access to the club is $600 while the American card is $450 initially/$400 yearly after but does not bring any status. (I haven’t been diligent about collecting American miles to date since I usually fly United). 
Would prefer not to get the American card if I don’t need to.
Does anyone know a better way of gaining access to American clubs?

Side note: my grandparents used to give my family lifetime access to US Air clubs back in the day as special gifts. By the time I graduated High School, you could no longer buy these.

awardtravel,"Hi everyone,

I used to travel abroad ~2x a year for work/vacation, which came to a screeching halt in 2020.  I'd been saving up UR points since 2015 when my first kid was born to use on a blowout anniversary trip with my wife, which we've finally gone ahead and booked, and I wanted to share.
- ORD-&gt;FRA in United Polaris (155k points each)
- CDG -&gt; ORD on Air France (105k points each)

It's entirely possible that we could have held out and gotten these tickets for cheaper, but we had a mountain of points, the cash rates for those flights was obscene, and we have no flexibility for travel days.  Add in that my wife has never flown international business class, we're really looking forward to it!

To add on, I recently found out that the largest trade show in my industry will be in Barcelona starting 2 weeks after the vacation ends, so I'm heading straight back over the pond.  The one nonstop from Chicago was over $10k in cash for busineess class on AA, which I'd never get past T&amp;E at my company, so I dug in a bit to find better alternatives to see if I could swing a lay-flat.

- ORD-&gt;MAD business class on Iberia (50k points)
- LIS-&gt;ORD business class on TAP ($770 cash)

With this, I'll get a bonus day in Madrid on the way out and Lisbon on the way home, which never hurts.  A close third place was Air Serbia, with business class at under $1k ORD-BEG; I'll have to save that one for the next time I need a cheap flight to Europe.

3) Nov 29 ET 609/813 BKK-ADD-ZNZ, that's where the nightmare happened. We were required to deplane after 2 hours wait on ET 609 without any notice on the technical issue and stayed for another 3 hours in the lounge before ET decided to arrange us a hotel. (that's 6am in the morning and sadly for fellows on Economy, they waited whole 5 hours on the plane). The coordination to hotel was extremely unprofessional: the impatient crew escorted us out of security only got a last minute notice to board the plane again. We thus went through the hassle to security check again but just after that the crew got another last minute notice saying we would go to hotel. WTF!!!! Eventually after a 1-hour cramped minibus ride to the hotel, we were shocked by the condition: bad shower, bad air condition, bad food, etc. In the end, the flight was delayed for 24 hours.

awardtravel,"Hi all, first-time poster here but I owe this forum a lot and wanted to share in the hope of giving something back!

After many hours of research, I finally booked an RTW trip for my wife and me late next year. We've both always wanted to go to Japan and the ANA RTW seemed like an incredible deal with the opportunity to make a few stop-offs along the way. This is our first redemption aside from a pretty lame JFK-DUB economy flight we paid for with Avios a year ago.

Although we both travel quite a bit neither of us has ever flown business class so needless to say we’re excited. We don’t have super flexible jobs or more than the typical PTO but by traveling over thanksgiving we’ve been able to stretch the trip to 3 1/2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

|Destination|Route|Airline|Aircraft|Stay|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Istanbul|JFK - IST|TK|77W|3 days|
|Thailand|IST - BKK|TK|333|9 days|
|Japan|SIN - HND|ANA|788|9 days|
|New York|FUK - TPE - JFK|EVA|789 / 77W|Home|

&amp;#x200B;

Total cost **125,000 miles** \+ **$925** in taxes and fees per person.

A few notes:

* For the Thailand leg, we plan to take a cheap cash flight to Krabi as soon as we land in BKK. We plan to spend a week on the beach and going around the islands, before heading down to Singapore (also a cheap cash flight) for a couple of nights before our flight to Japan.
* In Japan, our plan is to travel down from Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hiroshima, ending in Fukuoka, where we’ll spend a night before taking the return leg back home.
* Booking for two is obviously harder and ruled out a lot of options. That said, by always searching for two people I don't actually know what those options might have been.
* The most difficult leg of the trip was definitely Asia-US. Reversing this was even harder since it would have to have been at the start of the itinerary and availability is snapped up so fast. The original plan was to take ANA from Tokyo to somewhere on the west coast (most likely SEA), or if we could, IAD. But once I discovered the TPE flight direct to JFK this seemed to make most sense, especially after reading about EVA’s business product and the lower fees.  We’re NYC-based, so it was nice to avoid any re-positioning flights, which I felt made up for the inconvenience of backtracking to Taipei. We were also borderline with the mileage bracket and decided to just cough up the extra 10,000 points to give us more flexibility when the time came to book.
* During one version of the itinerary (there were many, many) I was eyeing BKK-AMS on EVA, which I thought was a particularly good option for anyone looking for SE Asia to Europe. Most other options seemed to route via TPE.
* To search, I used a combination of cowtool (super helpful) and ANA's multi-trip search. Cowtool was very accurate and one of its many advantages is showing some flights a few days before they are released to ANA, which was particularly helpful for the final leg on EVA. The one issue I found is that it's stopped showing availability from SE Asia to Japan, including the SIN-HND flight we eventually booked. Still, an incredible tool. ANA's search acted as the validator for anything I found and I had no issues when went to call in to make the booking.
* Turkish availability was weird. It seemed wide open for most of my planning, then disappeared for a couple of weeks, before coming back just around when we were finalizing the itinerary. Going JFK-WAW on LOT or JFK-BRU on Brussels were our backups for the US-Europe leg.
* I first made the booking with a dummy date for the final leg so that we could lock in the rest of the trip. I got a bit panicky when the TPE-JFK leg started booking out more quickly than I'd be observing but was ultimately able to change to the date we wanted once it opened up. A bonus was that we were able to change the Singapore-Tokyo flight to be into Haneda instead of Narita since that had opened up too. We had no issue changing airports since the destination city was the same.
* Agree with all other reports that ANA reps are the best! I generally called around 7 pm EST and was on hold for about an hour each time.
* As for hotels, we are using our modest stash of Chase UR for Hyatt's in Istanbul (Grand Hyatt) and Tokyo (Hyatt Regency, as long as it hasn't been torn down by then). We'll used cash in Thailand and hopefully stay with a friend in Singapore.

Anyway, that's about all I can think of for now but let me know if you have any questions. Thanks again to you all! Cheers.",ANA RTW for Two - Nov/Dec 2023,,irishexplorer123,,1,12/19/2022 6:04

I have 330K Chase UR points that I am trying to use to get to Japan. I understand there is the ANA via Virgin Atlantic but it is a crap shoot since availability is rare so I'm biting the bullet on transferring to Singapore Airlines. 

I've been searching for One-Way availability but everything is either wait-listed or not available for the Saver option.. whereas a few weeks ago I saw at least some Saver availability... Even the just released dates are already wait-listed.. Does anyone have any experience with Singapore Airlines wait-listing? I don't want to chance the cancelled (2 weeks before flight).

awardtravel,"Using Alaska Airlines current miles sale my wife and I were able to purchase 120k miles for $2200 each ...and pretty easily confirm two J award tickets RT Seattle/Narita on JAL. (That same ticket would be at least $9000 each if you bought a non refundable full price ticket.) So that's nearly a 75% savings, and the whole process took less than 24 hours, all on the Alaska Air website. 

So now I turn to our initial 4 day hotel stay, and for the sake of simplicity, we will only look at the Conrad Tokyo. A King bed / City View Room for four nights is $4200 (inc tax) at the lowest rate (AARP) if you pay the hotel directly. If I wanted to price it using solely the same aforementioned AK Miles sale, and buy all the needed miles for the stay (303k) it actually costs more at $5900... than the cash rate. If you use a *combination* of miles and cash (buying 60k AK miles @ $1200 + 1430 cash) that same four day stay cost $2630. (My head is starting to spin now) . In the simplest terms, of course I'd rather pay $2630 than $4200...but the variance in miles value just boggles my mind. Does this seem normal to you? 

I really respect this sub and I took a fair amount of time getting this far so I feel it's not 'low-effort' to ask you folks how you'd approach this differently. Thx!

I have been spending time on this board and searching for award flights have been a bit overwhelming and frustrating. I will check awardhacker, then go signup for the airline award programs to be met with crazy 400k points for premium economy, or the airline not even having any flights at all end of May mia-italy. We want to spend about 10 days exploring Northern Italy (Milan, Venice, Lake Garda) . We are open flying to ANYWHERE where we can take a train within reason to get to final destinations (Venice, Milan, Lake Garda etc.) we are open to flying into Zurich, Milan, Rome, Venice etc.  


* We are hoping to get 4 award seats in Business J (prefer) or premium economy if the airlines products is good.
* We are also open to splitting up (2 teens in premium economy and 2 adults with lap baby in Business) - if that is even allowed, the teens are very well behaved &amp; we would monitor them.
* We must all be on the same flight.
* We would also consider flying the night flight to europe in J and the flight back in economy or premium economy, basically we just really don't want to fly overnight departing fight in economy.

I have learned from this board and aware we have unfortunately missed our best chance by booking early 300+ days out, but hoping we may still be able to find something since we are flexible in dates, and airports.  
Research:

* In Awardhacker it seems that it would take 80k- 100k points per person RT Business traveling from Miami to Milan with Virgin, Jal, ANA Alaska Lufthansa, however I am not finding flights even exist for many of these when I search google flights.
* Airfrance website was super crazy, they want 467k miles and $327 for 1 premium economy ticket.

Should I be searching one way tickets instead of round trip? What airline(s) should i be putting my focus into?  
More details:

* Points: 330k MR, 70k UR, 100k AA
* Num of Passengers: Family of 4 +lap baby
* flexible - can depart anytime May 24-June 4, and return 10-12 days later.",Recommendation for MIA to Italy in May for 4,,PelicanLake2,,0,12/18/2022 15:27

General question: I am wondering about the feasibility of a family member redeeming MR points for a one-way  flight in J for me as a gift (would transfer via a partner airline and just purchase the flight). It seems to be much easier than trying to convert (and pay transfer fees), and certainly a better deal than me purchasing in cash. Biggest question is, assuming the ticket is booked in my name (but on their card), will I run into any roadblocks using the ticket? I've read in other posts the airlines occasionally ask for the original credit card used to book at the check-in counter, etc. Wondering how common this is, and if there are other pitfalls to be aware of.

Have seen good redemptions across many partners like Cathay Pacific, VS, BA, AF, Quantas, etc. Only minor issue that most flights from KUL or CGK cut the trip in half via a layover in JED, DIA, etc. Strangely, several of the flights are \*only available when searching by points/miles and will not come up in a general search if using cash to buy the ticket outright.

I am based out of St. Louis Missouri. I have a very travel heavy job, I typically will travel at least once every other week, sometimes three or four cities in a week if needed. 

I currently am using Southwest. I have my companion pass and I have enough points saved up from work trips alone to travel free for probably at least a year or two.  

I like Southwest, but wanted to pledge loyalty to a second airline to start earning points towards international flights, on the company dime. I’ve seen most of the United States and want to start traveling internationally more. Southwest doesn’t leave North America/islands. 

From all of my reading and asking around a lot of people have said Delta. I looked into their program, and it looks like their rates of earning free flights takes a long time and isn’t great. Their perks &amp; customer service look good though.

So to sum it up; what do y’all recommend for airlines that travel outside of the United States, and that I can rack up points pretty quickly to earn free flights?

My initial backup is to go to Turks and Caicos, but I'm hesitant to pay the $1800/night for the Ritz after looking at the reviews on flyer talk. 

Budget is flexible as long as it's somewhat worth it. I.e. I don't want to pay $1800/ night for the Ritz if the room is sub par and the service there doesn't reflect other Ritz (consensus review on flyertalk and also experience from a friend when recently spent time at beaches resort in Turks and Caicos).

easy to reach, ~4 hours flight from DFW
A+ beach preferred, the last beach we went to was Clearwater Florida, I would say that beach was B-, water was dirty and a lot of people.

awardtravel,"Here's how to get SW to issue you 135k+ in RR points and a Companion Pass all without spending money other than the annual fee!! Companion Pass is where you can appoint a travel buddy to fly free with you for 1-2 years.

So here's how to scam SW:

\#1- Sign up for the promotional points CC offer (mine was the biz card 80k points if you spend 5k in the first 3 months) $199 annual fee

\#2- When you get the card, charge $5,000 and let the statement clear. SW will automatically send you the RR points to your account on the day the statement posts.

\#3- Call Chase and dispute the charge OR cancel the charge. (example you spent the $5k on a future car rental months from now or a future vacation at a hotel. Cancel the rental or hotel for a full reimbursement)

\#4- Chase will fix the charge or the charge will fall off automatically leaving your balance at $0. All you pay is the upfront annual fee of the CC

\#5- Once you hit 135k in points for SW they will grant you the Companion Pass. If you still need more points to reach 135k, simply follow the same steps with another SW CC. You can have 1 personal card and 2 business cards. (also ANYONE can qualify for the business card even if you dont own a business! Another hack)

\#6- And just like that, you have a companion pass and over 135k RR points without having to spend anything other than the CC Annual Fee.

What happened to me: Its Dec 2022, I signed up for the SW business CC so I could get the 80k in points as long as I spent 5k in the first 3 months. I had a merchant accidentally charge me $2750 and due to that specific charge, I ""spent"" over $5,000 with other charges made. SW automatically granted me 80k in RR points and issued me a companion pass that I have not earned yet. It was given prematurely as I was in the middle of handling the accidental charge with the bank. The accidental charge from the merchant was immediately disputed and handled through Chase on 12/1 and as of 12/5 it was refunded. The problem is, the charge was still cleared and in the process of being refunded on 12/2, and on that same date Chase and SW granted me the 80k in points which I do not want. Apparently my statement closed on 12/2 even though I had just received the CC in mail on 11/28.  I spoke with Chase bank and all fixes have been made on their end (refunds and corrected charges) but that I would still need to contact SW to reverse the promotional award that shouldn’t have been given to me. I have only spent $2,948 and should only be awarded the 80k when I spend $5k in 3 months. I sent SW my chase statement reflecting the accidental charge and the reimbursement and that I have not yet hit my spending minimum for the period.

SW responded to me stating that they cant and wont remove the points or companion pass. I found a flaw in their promotional points program and companion pass promo that could be scammed through a miscommunication between Chase and SW. I did not actually pay for $5000+ in charges, only $2,948. The incorrect charges were refunded to me, just not faster than SW prematurely issued points and a CP. I wanted to earn my companion pass the right way in 2023 when I have actually and accurately reached 135k+ in points.  I wanted to have the companion pass for the duration of 2023 through end of 2024, but now instead I only have it for Dec 2022 and all of 2023. Not ideal AT ALL! But if they wont fix it, fine. I'll take my points and CP without having to spend the money! I tried to do the right thing and notify SW of this and they could care less, no assistance from them. Simply blaming Chase and Chase blaming SW

Has anyone else found this hack/scam? Pretty crazy that SW doesnt seem to care that myself and a friend will be flying on their dime and not mine for the next 12 months!",Here's how to get SW to issue you 135k+ in RR points and a Companion Pass all without spending money,,mmerr00,,0,12/14/2022 21:26

I'm planning my honeymoon with my soon-to-be wife and we are planning to go to Thailand for 2 weeks. I originally got into the credit card awards game for this specific purpose, so I'm really excited to make it a reality! I've been trying to figure out what is the best way to book on points to keep the costs as low as possible and hearing lots of different things and want to know what's the best option. Any input is much appreciated!

We're in the NYC area and the (tenative) plan is to fly round trip to/from Singapore and take short flights to/from Thailand and take flights when needed around the country to visit the different spots. 

Our *dream* would be to fly business/first class there and back, but I'm not sure if this will be possible?

Currently I have:

254k UR points

170k United miles. 

I'm currently planning out how we will get there and from checking the Chase portal, I can burn all 254k miles for a round trip direct flight from NYC &lt;-&gt; SIN for both of us in premium economy, then we would take another short flight to BKK. It's a 19 hour flight so I'd highly prefer being comfortable in a higher class. I did also see transferring the UR points to virgin and flying ANA business class to Japan and transferring there to but the site wont give me the option to see how many miles it would cost. 

Is there a better option? We're traveling in September 2023 btw.

awardtravel,"Recently made my first fairly large points redemption (65k AA, 60k Amex, 90k Chase) and learned quite a few things along the way that I figure I document for others in the community to learn from.

1. **Double check hotel room availability, especially when changing dates.** I initially planned a Sunday - Friday trip, where there was availability for a given room type, but later changed to a Wednesday - Monday. However, I never double checked that the room was still available for those dates. Turns out it wasn't available through the weekend (makes sense that demand would be higher), which I only figured out after I already transferred all my points. I ended up being able to barely cover the difference by buying a large sum of Hyatt points directly, which I know isn't generally great but I still ended up getting the hotel for cheap overall.
2. **Hyatt shows you the lowest rate across your days, not the average rate.** There was exactly one day in the middle of my range that was 25k and the rest were 29k, but I assumed they were all 25k. *Double check their points calendar* before you do all your points transfers.
3. **The first Hyatt transfer is quick, but any follow-up transfer is slow.** This is something I read about, where new accounts have a quick first transfer / buying points but any follow-up transfer shortly afterward (which I needed to cover my mis-assumption about weekend availability) takes a day and some change.
4. **Flight availability changes fast. Be on the safe side, especially if transfers aren't instant.** I was waiting on the second above Hyatt transfer to happen and when I checked a day or two later, availability had significantly changed. Flights I wanted, and I thought had plenty of spare seats, were gone. My lesson learned here is to be very cautious about anything if you aren't able to do the transfer and booking in one session, or at least call and place a hold on the flight. Also, most airlines let you easily cancel within a day or so of booking, which is a great safety net (albeit locks you into that currency, if you transferred it from Amex or something).

I made it out of this trip booking at about 1.2cpp for a Delta flight and an AA flight (which I think is pretty good for (1) economy flights (2) during a peak time and (3) only a few months out) and 2cpp for the hotel (which is decent, but nothing special for Chase -&gt; Hyatt transfers).",My First Award Travel Booking: Lessons Learned,,ComfortableFig9642,,0,12/13/2022 16:01

Late Jan/early Feb 2023

SFO - EWR in UA J for 25k UR and $30 in fees (redeye)

Originally saw it as 35k on UA’s portal, snagged it to hold it, then checked Aeroplan where it was 10k miles cheaper so transferred UR to AC and rebooked. One way cash price seems to be ~$1k so getting 4 cpp I think!

Excited to try out Polaris for the first time despite not getting lounge access on transcon flights. Being able to sleep for ~5 hours in a lie flat should be a game changer when I’m used to taking a redeye in Y.",First redemption completed,,waitwhythisisnotfair,,1,12/13/2022 11:28
awardtravel,"Hello All: Long time lurker, first time poster and the first time I’ve really used any points that we have collected and I’m just a bit lost. I am planning our 10 year anniversary and have the following miles to use. We are ready to “burn” any and all miles we have just wondering what the best route to go is. Any help would be MUCH appreciated :) 

Chase UR points: 630k miles   
Hilton: 530k points  
Hyatt: 62k miles

We are hoping to do 3-4 days in the Swiss Alps (specifically Interlaken area if possible) and 3-4 days in Santorini totaling 10 days total (Open to flying in/out of Athens which seems to make more sense for reward tickets) and would like to fly Business/First.

We live in (CHA) Chattanooga but willing to travel to (BNA) Nashville or (ATL) Atlanta if its makes more sense to fly out of there. 

——

From what I’m seeing, goin through united portal and take the following route is the “easiest” 

(CHA) Chattanooga &gt; (ZRH) Zurich &gt; (ATH) Athens &gt; (CHA) Chattanooga right around 250k miles flying United Polaris business class

——

Open to making (MXP) Milan the middle destination as it’s a short (ish) drive to the mountains and may open us up to more routes. (Like Emirates EWR-MXP only 75k miles for business, but the struggle is getting to EWR and connecting through different airlines, going out of the airport then back through security etc.) 

Another interesting option: 

Booking on Air Canada 68k ORD - Zurich (United Polaris business class) 

Is booking through Air Canada the best option?

Is it smarter to book economy tickets then upgrading to business with miles?

What else am I missing? Trying to get the most “bang for my points buck” but also just want a seamless nice trip :)

I am attempting to book business class flights to Japan for my husband and myself this upcoming April. We have just under 290k miles at Capital One, which I had hoped would be enough to fly business class to Japan, but I'm finding my search both confusing and discouraging. 

I dipped my toes into the various rewards partners I could transfer miles to with Capital One (including Asia Miles, Aeroplan, Avianca, British Airways Executive Club, etc.), but the numbers I was seeing were close to **350k miles** for one person, let alone two. I tried using United's mile redemption tool (which was extremely helpful and something I discovered through this board), and it did show rewards space on certain routes from **IAH -&gt; HND (\~175k) and another from EWR -&gt; NRT**, but when I would try and see if they were available via the rewards partners to book, I couldn't see anything / book anything. 

I also tried using [point.me](https://point.me) and planning itineraries from various airports, but was also getting quoted 250k+ per person.  I've seen people talk about getting better deals (125k or under per person) using Virgin Points or attempting to get award space on JAL, but I haven't encountered anything like that.

Are my expectations unrealistic / is there a better way I should be trying to do this? Is it worth buying premium economy tickets and trying to upgrade? My husband has back issues that are going to make these flights bad already, and I would love for him to be more comfortable, especially since we're going in large part because of my interests. I've included some relevant details here:

* **Dates**: Our originally dates were the last two weekends in April (**4/15-4/29**), but we're flexible in terms of moving it closer. Due to work commitments, it has to be before or during those last two weeks, or we'd have to wait until **October 2023**. 
* **Airline**: TBH, I'm not super fussed about which airline we fly as long as it's a comfortable business class.
* **Location**: We live on the East Coast, but if we can fly business class, I'm willing to book domestic flights separately to get to whatever airport we need. 
* **NRT/HND**: We're ambivalent about which we fly into, as I can plan around either. 
* **Additional Cap One Miles**: My mother also has a Cap One Card, and would likely be willing to transfer me points if I asked (she's not able to travel right now), but I don't want to ask unless I'm sure we need them (**likely about 50k**).

awardtravel,"Hi everybody. I've almost saved up enough Hawaiian Airline miles to redeem 4 Virgin Atlantic Upper Class seats ideally for SFO &gt; LHR round trip this coming Summer. If I can't book that route I'd settle for any airport originating in the US and any destination in the UK. I'm looking for some advice to make it happen and perhaps save some time.  


I've done this before a couple of times for 1 &amp; 2 seats in the past (2007 &amp; 2008) and remember it being a real pain. I had to call Hawaiian Miles and ask them to check each date for availability. It took at least an hour of checking all possible combinations for availability. I have always started the reservation process 6 months in advance of the desired travel time. I remember what helped me one time is that I was able to get a Virgin rep on the phone to ask them to check their available reward dates and use that info to help me hone in on dates when asking the Hawaiian Airlines rep to check dates for me.   


I tried this again in 2011 trying all routes from the continental US to all UK airports and wound up with nothing after spending hours on the phone multiple times. I had the customer service reps check nearly every possible combination for the entire Summer even going into Fall and was not successful. The agent even told me they would check into it because it seemed to them like their code share partner might not be living up to obligations of making award seats available for Hawaiian Airlines customers. I also tried again to get a Virgin rep on the phone that would help me but wasn't successful for this particular trip. I ended up redeeming for 2 main cabin fares from LAS to LTN.   


I'm about to begin the process again soon and wanted to see if anyone had any advice or tricks to save me some time in this endeavor. Is there an ideal time to start the search? Is 6 months too late, too early or a good enough time to start the process?  It was hard enough finding 2 seats before, maybe 4 seats in Upper Class is too big a request? As a last resort I'd settle for main cabin seats but I really like the idea of maximizing the value out of my Hawaiian Miles and getting Upper Class seats.

awardtravel,"Okay, buddy, listen up. If you want to book some cheap business class tickets with your points, here's what you need to do:

Look for credit card sign-up bonuses and promotions that offer a ton of points. This can help you quickly earn enough points for a business class ticket, you lazy piece of shit.

Use your points to book flights with airlines that have a good redemption rate. This means that you can actually get some value out of your points by using them to book flights with these airlines, instead of just letting them sit there and collect dust like you usually do.

Look for flights that have low fees and surcharges. Some airlines add fees and surcharges to the cost of flights booked with points, which can make them more expensive. But hey, maybe you're too stupid to understand that.

Be flexible with your travel dates. If you can be flexible with your travel dates, you might be able to find cheaper flights and use your points to book them. But I doubt it, you're probably too much of a stubborn asshole to do that.

Consider transferring your points to airline partners. Some credit card rewards programs allow you to transfer your points to airline partners, which can give you more options for booking flights with points. But I'm sure you already knew that, right genius?

Keep an eye out for special promotions and deals. Airlines and credit card companies often offer promotions and deals that can help you save money on business class tickets. But I'm sure you're too busy watching cat videos on YouTube to care about that.

Overall, if you want to book cheap business class tickets with points, you need to be flexible, do your research, and look for ways to maximize the value of your points. But let's be real, you're probably not going to do any of that.

I booked a one way flight from SEA to HND in April for 27,500 Virgin points (transferred from Chase UR) + $5.60 in fees. The flight is with Delta, and I tried searching for the non-economy award tickets but would end up getting no results vs plenty of dates for booking via economy. This was my first time booking with Virgin so I’m unfamiliar with what they have access to/if this is expected. Does Virgin not have access to non-economy seats? Or is it assumed that the non-economy award seats were already booked?
I have ~100k points with delta, but am doubtful those could be applied towards an upgrade since I purchased via Virgin?

I needed to fly JFK-MAA around Christmas/New Year's but searching on Aeroplan for JFK-DXB-MAA yielded no results on EK J. I only needed it OW on the JFK-DXB leg and specifically on the A380. 

Expanded my search and dates and finally found SFO-DXB-MAA OW for some dates in early Jan. The rate was 176k points for 2 passengers plus ~$750 in fuel surcharges. There was an option to pay 220k points and much less in fuel surcharges but I didn't have enough points for that. The SFO-DXB leg was on the A380 like I wanted!

Seats were going fast and it was nerve-racking waiting for my points to transfer. But both Amex and Chase were pretty instantaneous. I had to call Chase for a name mismatch issue and they were very helpful and fixed it immediately.

The stickler was I needed 3000 more points and Aeroplan does not allow holding reservations. (Points well is dry because we just came back from a Hawaii vacation.) I bought the points directly from Aeroplan's website thinking it would be instantaneous but alas, no, says it can take upto 72 hours to show up. Cue panicking!

I thought let me buy some MR instead and called up Amex. Another friendly CSR told me about the option to expedite my pending points if I paid the min. balance due. So I did that and the pending points immediately became available.

From what I understand, getting status in an alliance gives you nice general perks like priority checkin and lounges, but if you want to redeem, it's easiest to do with the airline your frequent flyer number is associated with.

We take 2-3 long flights each year, and are extremely flexible. The priority is lie flat business class to avoid our butts hurting on 12+ hours flights. We could fly any route, and fly economy to reach our final destination.

The places we tend to fly to the most are London and Buenos Aires. We also plan to fly to Australia once every two years. At some point we will also add the US back in the rotation.

What's the best option for long term optimization? So far my pick is one world alliance with British Airways. How likely is that we could upgrade to lie flat with Qantas? We could fly from less desirable routes like Rome -&gt; Perth. 

My main debate is between Star Alliance and Oneworld, and then if there are any red flags about joining a specific partner program. We haven't flown one airline more than others during our travels, so we'd of course have to start being more strategic about that.

Though I didn't see any Korean Air availability on DL, AF, AM sites. I even put the tickets on hold (or so I thought) by phone while waiting for points to transfer over. I had to take points from Amex, Chase and C1. C1 took a few hours, while Chase and Amex were instant. 
Then after the points arrived, I called Emirates to book the on hold tickets. I've booked Emirates tickets that were on hold before, though not for partner awards, so I wasn't worried at this point. Turns out the tickets were on a ""waitlist"" and the agent would not be able to book. I thought, okay, it's still showing availability on the website, let's try to book online since I've seen reports of people booking KE award right from the site. But it kept erroring out after hitting payment. So I made several calls to see if agents could see any availability. Also tried online booking a few more times. Nothing.
We ended up paying (way too much) by cash since it was a family emergency and the departure date was less than 3 days away.

awardtravel,"Hi all, hoping veterans here can provide some clarity.

I am flying with Emirates for a business trip next month and while my outbound trip will be in J (thanks mom!), my inbound trip is in Y that I hope to upgrade using miles at the counter upon check-in if available (important to note I've never done this before, only read about how to do it). Both the booking landing page and miles calculator say need around 87,500 miles to upgrade from my Y fare class, which is fine--I don't have that much miles to spare, but I have enough that I would only need to buy around $600 worth of miles to make up the difference (cash upgrade is $3,000+ so this is a steal). 

However, when I check on the Upgrade with Miles on the Manage my Booking page, the miles required is *significantly higher--*almost 40,000 points more! That's shocking to me, and I don't know which is more accurate/which number I'll hear at the check-in counter.

Alaska Airlines - (Yes, I know I said UR but I have 120k AS and wanted to see if there was anything, as I don't mind covering it for them.) Found some connecting flights via British Airways for 60k, but surcharges total $910. Ridiculous. Also found Air Lingus connecting in Dublin, but connection looks to be 10hrs. Not suitable for age 60+.

Air France -  Here is where I believe I may have found the best option, but again not 100% sure. I found F availability from JFK&gt;CDG&gt;BCN for 100,500 + $206.00 EUR. 

Aeroplan - In searching JFK, EWR, and PHL, the best I could find on 9/26 was 90k operated by UA and Avianca for 90k but the route is atrocious with a 17hr layover in BOG. 

Side note: I do also have 162k KrisFlyer miles. I'm not sure if I came upon outdated information, but I read EWR&gt;BCN is bookable via UA on Polaris for 60k pp, and that this is bookable by searching for availability on UA's website.

He said he cannot add a child's bed into the room because of housekeeping rules, but I said that its fine, we all fit in a king.

I met the spend bonuses on 2x Alaska Biz cards, but still waiting for the bonus to post, so I can't book yet (no companion fare yet). Happy to book 60/40 with someone if you have 2 companion fares available. Additional kudos if you already have AS/OW status for upgrade potential in main. You will also get 2x miles with Alaska CC and elite bonus RDM earning, on top of the base ~21k RDM and EQM from flying. Please DM me if this is you!

awardtravel,"Looking to book a one way business class trip from New York to London next summer using my Chase UR points. Got it narrowed down to two options:

1) Virgin out of JFK at 11pm for 57,500 points plus $875 in cash

2) United out of EWR 830pm for 91,700 points plus $6 in cash

At 1.5 cents per point, United is a better value to the tune of $375 per ticket (there will be four of us) and will require substantially less cash. 

But, JFK is much more convenient for us as is the timing of the flights. If we land at 830am London time will be 330am for our bodies. We'd basically be operating on no sleep and would likely book an extra earlier night at the hotel to compensate, so that will reduce the savings somewhat.

All in all, I'm leaning towards United, but having never travelled trans-atlantic business class before, I'd like to know what to expect from one vs the other. Is the Virgin experience noticeably better than United? Enough so to justify the extra spend? Or is it all just a waste of money/points?  (I could fly economy on UA for 30k points per ticket)

awardtravel,"Hi all, apologies in advance - this post is not about award travel, it is about buying tickets for cash. The reason I am posting it here is because this sub seems to me to be the one where I am most likely to receive answers. If I am violating the rules and condemning this post to be deleted - I accept the deletion.

Now to the actual question. I am planning a flight from US East Cost to Sydney in summer, and I would like to ask for some advice from people who have done the trip. I am optimizing for total duration of travel first (including layovers) and cost second.

My basic option is a United flight from Newark with a layover either on West Coast or in IAD. Here are a couple of reasons why I am hesitating to book just that, all of them minor, but may be there are better options?

* Unless the layover is in SFO, the US leg would be in lipsticked coach AKA domestic first. And even than I am afraid it is not actually guaranteed that UA will not change planes last minute for the plane with no Polaris.
* On the way back, I will need to collect the bags and pass through immigration and customs while making a connection. I hate that, as it means, I will have to do that (and be nervous about being late) instead of just relaxing in the lounge if I am making a connection somewhere outside US
* UA Polaris is OK, but just that. It gets the job done (which for me is exclusively lie flat bad), but other than that, nothing to write home about either about comfort, flight attendants (not very *attending* in my experience) or food.

With that being said, I'd really welcome some advice from people who have done similar trip recently and would like to share their stories and suggestions.

I’m trying to book an award flight for this route (25th March - 9th April) using my credit card reward points. The FFP transfer partners on my CC are Ethiopian Airlines, Turkish Airmiles, AirFrance-KLM, Etihad, United Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways

I’m a total newbie and yet to fly my first award flight. Requesting the best/cheapest award flight option for this journey

As per my initial research, I’ve checked the below deals (one-way). However, I’m sure “experts” can suggest better deals

1. Flying Blue
One way flight on Air France Portal - 37500 miles + 60 $
One way flight on KLM Portal = 43500 miles + 55 $

2. Etihad Guest
One way flight = 22891 miles + 162 $

3. United MileagePlus
One way flight = 30000 miles + 34 $

4. Qatar Airways (Privilege Club)
One way flight through QA/BA = 40250 miles + (not able to load dollars page)
One way flight through partners = Error ""Acitivity not allowed""

5. Turkish Airlines (Miles&amp;Smiles) 
One way flight = 20000 + 174 $
This is the sweetest deal as the flight here is non-stop (only non-stop from the given options) except for the very high taxes part
However, it is mentioned on the website that Classic Plus members can pay taxes through miles too. Need help if there is any way to book this using the miles only without the status

Help me prepare for the close-in availability lottery. Whose palms are sweating now?!

**Scenario**

\- P2 has a last minute work trip planned for 28/29/30 JAN 2023 - 11/12 FEB 2023.

\- One week in New Zealand, one week in Australia

\- P2 wants me to accompany and I'm preparing for the close-in availability “lottery” for 1 J seat on the long-haul to the South Pacific 

 **Details**

\- Date Flexibility: Limited to aforementioned – 28/29/30 JAN Outbound &amp; 11/12 FEB Inbound

\- Points Balances: 194,067 UR (\~200k+ mid-December); 165,772 MR; 86,823 Cap1; 310,413 Marriott Bonvoy (aka up to 125,000 Alaska Airlines points \[20,000 x 5\] + \[5,000 bonus x 5\])

\- Award Seats Sought: 1 J or even F if I can score a sweet spot

(P2 wants me to capitalize on a premium award seat if possible. We do not have to travel together if this means an premium seat for me.)

\- Origin: IAD but will position anywhere in the US (JFK, IAH, DFW, LAX, SFO). Would rather not position in YVR unless it’s a killer AC deal (which I have not found yet for obvious reasons aka missed my almost-year-out window).

**Prep Steps Taken**

\- Read “Australia / New Zealand” sidebar

\- Set 48 alerts in Expert Flyer for all nonstop routes between JFK/IAH/DFW/LAX/SFO and SYD/MEL/BNE or NAN or AKL

\- Read blogs by TPG, UpgradedPoints.com, ThriftyTraveler.com, Prince of Travel

\- Given current UR/MR/CAP1 balances, concluded best scenario may be transferring Marriott Bonvoy points to Alaska for 55k close-in business class tickets to NAN or SYD via Fiji Airways or Qantas 

\- Familiarized myself with Alaska Airlines queries + conducted close-in availability queries for the month of December and found some promising J seats (operated by either Qantas or Fiji) as close as 3 days or as far as 29 days.

\- Tried leveraging point.me, but found that after researching and doing practice queries on my own over several airlines (UA, AA, AS), the basic subscription wasn’t useful for me. 

**Current Plan**

\- Pay Y cash fare to position from LAX or SFO (seems to be the best close-in option)

\- Secure 1 close-in J award seat for 55,000 points operated by Qantas or Fiji to SYD or NAN (via AS queries)

\- Pay Y cash fare from either SYD or NAN to WLG

\- Pay Y cash fare from WLG to SYD 

\- Secure 1 close-in J award seat from SYD/MEL/BNE to USA (nonstop)

\- If that fails, pay Y cash fare from SYD to NAN and secure 1 close-in J award availability from NAN to USA (nonstop)

\- If all attempts to secure J award availability fail on the return flight, book cash itinerary that matches P2’s return itinerary because I’ve at least survived the long-haul to the destinations and don’t need to be refreshed when coming back stateside.

**Other Notes / Observations Gathered**

\- UA, AA, AC appear to require an exorbitant amount of points at the moment – obviously due to being just outside the 3-4 week close-in timeframe + being way outside the initial award release windows 

\- Can only fly NZ via UA since NZ’s award charts are wild

\- Don’t mind burning all Marriott Bonvoy points to fly Alaska / OneWorld partners

\- Biggest concern is the lag time in transferring Marriott Bonvoy points as AS only holds itineraries for 24 hours (as per Google searches)

By the end of the year I'm going to finish on 13,151 PQP, that's a little under 2000 short of the 15,000 you need for 1K assuming you don't have the flight number (which I don't).

That said, I have the option for an upcoming flight to use the Premier Accellerator, something like 2000 PQP for around $2.7K. To me that's incredibly steep. But wanted to ask the community, is the bonus 280 plus points worth it? My gut says probably not, but keen to hear from experts who might be better able to value this for me.

For context I would use United plus points mainly for business upgrades to Australia (Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne).

Also I have purchased some flights this year with Virgin Australia - if I attach my United number to that booking, will it help me in any way?

awardtravel,"Hey all, looking for some advice and sanity check for my plan to go visit Australia.

Information from the template:

- **Origin and destination cities (are they flexible?):**
     - Origin: Flexible, willing to do repositioning flight to YVR, LAX, SFO and maybe DFW
     - Destination: One of BNE, MEL and SYD. Willing to reposition.

- **Number of Travelers (Your chances of success goes down as this number goes up):** 1

- **One way or round-trip:** Round-trip, but flexible on doing two separate one-ways booked apart in time. This is me visiting home, so no urgent need to book return ASAP.

- **Class of service desired:** Business

- **Desired date(s) of travel (are they flexible? Hard dates == Less Chances for success)**: Sometime in Jan, Feb or Mar.

- **Your points balances:** 246k (145k AMEX MR, 101k Rewards Miles)

### What have you found so far?
&gt; (list at least two itineraries you've found, including flight numbers and cost in miles)

For one way: 80k AA miles, repositioning to either {YVR, LAX or DFW} and then direct to SYD (via a Qantas flight) by American Airline redemption. This totals to 160k AA miles if I did the same thing returning to the US. Specific flight numbers:

- DFW to SYD: QF 8
- LAX to SYD: QF 12
- YVR to SYD: QF 76

I understand I am very late in my intended timeline. I've discovered that US to AUS is a very coveted and rare flight path for awards. Qantas is stingy with award space and that generally the release timeline is 330-360 days ahead of the intended dates of travel.

With that said, having browsed a few threads by now here, my game plan is using the [seats.aero] (https://seats.aero/) website. I'll keep refreshing this site for about a month ahead and plan to book in mid-December or early January. I'm quite flexible on dates.

I'm also open to other flight paths, ideas or criticisms here.",USA to SYD - plan review and advice request,,OnlyFwdNvrBack,,0,11/30/2022 3:18

awardtravel,"AA seems to have great availability to Asia for 40k miles but since I'm from a smaller city, I'd have to choose an itinerary that connects to a larger airport. There's a lot of award availability 5-6 months out from the larger airport but if I were to look for routes from my hometown, I can only see availability spanning 2-3 months out. This is because the carrier that flies to the larger airport, JetBlue (partner of AA), only releases award space 2-3 months out. Both itineraries would still cost 40k on AA, regardless of the extra connection from my hometown. 

So my question is would I be able to book a ticket from the larger airport for a date 5-6 months out now for 40k and as JetBlue award availability opens up closer to the date, switch the itinerary to include the JetBlue leg? This way, I can lock in the international leg earlier for 40k and worst case, book the JetBlue connection separately.",AA Award Ticket Change Rules,,LikeaSumBoDi,,1,11/30/2022 3:13

Setup: 2 adults to fly from St. Louis (STL) to visit  Denmark, Norway and 1 other European city (based more on redemption). Flying in May-June

Points: primarily Chase UR

Redemption: positioning flight to YYZ with cash (\~$400-500) on Air Canada. Then used UA portal to buy business seats YYZ-WAW-CPH on Polish Airlines. Then BGO-AMS (Bergen-Amsterdam) on Scandinavian Airlines. Lastly AMS-ORD-STL via United Airlines Polaris Business (picked this as less stops even though there were cheaper business class options to get back)

Miles: total 350K + $350. 

YYZ-WAW-CPH: \~77K x2

BER-AMS: 0 (United Excursionist Perk)

So, when the opportunity arose, we decided to splurge using a ton of points to do a staycation in a luxury hotel (I'd prefer not to say the brand, but it's a well-known five star property) for a few days this past weekend. 

We're not bumpkins and have stayed in nice places before, but this felt beyond the pale and I feel a bit like I didn't do a great job of showing our thanks for an exceptional stay. In particular, we got upgraded on our last night to a room that I literally will never again be able to afford in my life unless I have a secret rich relative in my corner (I do not). It was a once in a lifetime experience that I will treasure. 

We tipped everyone who touched our bags $10 and the team member who gave us the upgrade, after I confirmed that they could accept gratuities, I gave $100 discretely in an envelope--this is genuinely at the top of what we could afford given what we had budgeted for this trip and the holidays. She did thank me later and told me it had been unnecessary, but I can't tell if what I did was enough (like, was it unnecessary because it was a trivial amount, or was it really not necessary?).

Multiple people, including the person I gave the $100 tip to, have told us that the best way to show our appreciation is via an online review, which I am more than happy to do. However, I don't know what/where is the best option. Are people really reading Google reviews or TripAdvisor for advice on whether or not they should go to a 5 star hotel?

I'm fairly new to award travel but have been working to get better with this hobby.  I am travelling to Cyprus in late Sept 2023 and returning beginning of Oct 2023. Booked the emirates 5th freedom from EWR-ATH in J on the inbound with the hope to upgrade to F. Looking at the return, I'm having a bit more trouble. I know positioning is relatively easy in Europe so habe been using point.me to try to find my way back from a bunch of placea. I was originally hoping to book Swiss J ZRH-ORD as I am based out of Chicago and SO prefers non-stop flights. I know SWISS typically releases J seats 300 days out and a few weeks-months ago, was finding availability almost every day thru Lifemiles/aeroplan for 63k/70k respectively. Within past week or two, I haven't been able to find anything and am a bit concerned as my return flight pretty much has to be on a Sunday due to work (we are both in Healthcare and SO in particular has very hard time returning on Monday/Tuesday). I signed up for seatspy and saw that they typically have better availability in Oct. Was hoping to get a little more insight as to if this is just SWISS not releasing seats due to high demand from Europe or if this is just how September can be and that I shouldn't worry for October. 

My backup options are LOT via lifemiles from either WAW or KRW for 63k or Iberia from Vienna for 49k in J (pretty great deal but unfortunately this would entail multiple stops and the layover is only about an 1 hr so nervous about missing MAD-ORD flight).

I’m a hopeless aviation romantic who feels like I missed out on the golden years of Pan Am, 747SPs at Kai Tak, and transatlantic Concordes. I grew up fascinated with this history but came of age just too late to experience any of it. Fortunately, I work for a major US airline which I absolutely love, I started out at a regional and eventually worked my way up. I’ve visited every inhabited continent and consider myself exceptionally lucky. A lot of this has even been in premium cabins which I am even more grateful for the chance to do. 
There is, however, one thing I haven’t done, and that is fly first class (could be technically F or J I just want a bed) on a 747. I’ve of course been on one, just like I’ve been on virtually every major aircraft type, just in the back since my airline doesn’t operate any. 
So my question is this, what is the best way to get a decent length flight up top on a 747? Given my aforementioned circumstances I can basically get anywhere on the globe to make this happen, and at any time (a privilege which I’m very grateful for)  although major holidays can be tricky. However, I’m also far from an expert at redeeming miles for airfare despite having flown around the globe dozens of times. I have ~90k UA miles, as well as ~400k chase points (although I have plans for a lot of those) I’m also not against paying a cash fare for the right route. 

Obviously, given the current geopolitical situation I’m basically stuck with Lufthansa or Korean, but there’s not really search options on their sites or third party travel sites for flights from anywhere to anywhere sorted by aircraft type. Im happy to fly well out of the way to make this happen, but it would be nice if I could work a cool destination in.

awardtravel,"Hotels - I will be honest, I found this part to be much harder than the actual flights that I booked close in. Park Hyatt Kyoto was the only property we had booked a long time ago. Everything else was booked AFTER the flight was booked.

**Hilton Tokyo** - 5 Nights, Hilton Diamond. Booked basically last minute(the day before the flight) because we decided to have 4 extra days in Tokyo with no actual hotel booked. Thank god for OpenHotelAlert saving my bacon here. There was no availability for the base room but it opened up exactly for our dates and I had it locked in ASAP. 280k HH for 5 Nights with 5th night free. Conrad Tokyo was our first choice but the location of this seemed perfect for the first few days and it was significantly cheaper.

This was the surprise of the trip. Was “upgraded” to an Executive Room. This is typical of Hilton Diamond where Upgrades mean f all. However, the actual room was a really nice size and the bathroom was small but had it where it counts. The water pressure was top notch, full rain shower and full Japanese style Toto Toilet. We have a full Toto setup at home so this weirdly felt homey. 

Concierge was able to get us a reservation at [Udatsu](https://youtu.be/A9eNzgDIYJg) - on very short notice and it basically ruined every other sushi for us, including Kyubey. The concierge team seemed very good but they looked overwhelmed with work the entire time we were there haha. If you need something definitely reach out before your actual trip.

Breakfast was, no other way to say it, the best we have had at any Hilton and we thought it was better than Andaz Maui. There was a huge variety of dishes from western, Chinese, Japanese etc and a lot of it changed everyday. We thought everything was delicious and I couldn’t get enough of the Shumai. I could have had that Shumai everyday and been happy with Japan. The spread was massive and even a picky eater like my wife had dishes she enjoyed. Do not miss the omelette station either. It was perfect everytime where the outside is just cooked but the curds where runny when you cut into it. The executive lounge was also quite good but it can turn into a bit of a zoo so unless you really want free food, I would skip it. Also do not get breakfast here because the spread is nothing compared to the regular restaurant breakfast.

Location was also fantastic. It was a 15 minute walk to Shinjuku but even better the Marunouchi line was a 7 minute walk from under the hotel! Basically connected us to all of Tokyo with ease. The perfect property to start your trip and orient yourself with Tokyo IMO. We really weren’t expecting much from this property and it really surprised us.

This was booked a little under a year ago when it was still 35k a night and Japan showed no signs of ever reopening.  Thank god I did because these standard nights never showed up again since they continue to play games with award availability. We had to book 12 night in a row and cut that down by calling Globalist concierge to make this booking. It was an absolute farce that involved transferring 420k UR to Hyatt. On top of that I wanted to use my SUAs but of course no standard suite availability. I set up an alert on OpenHotelAlert for a “Park Suite”, their standard room. It didn’t ping for close to a year till a week before my stay. Called Gloablist Line immediately and got the suite upgrade confirmed.



All that work was absolutely worth it. Even pulling into Ninenzaka Street and the hotels driveway you know it’s going to be special. The service was impeccable from the beginning. They sat us down and gave us a welcome drink of champagne and informed us that we were further upgraded to the “Ninenzaka House”. How much of an upgrade this is over the Park Suite I do not know. The room was absolutely massive as you can see in the video here and even had a powder room. Heated floors, really soft towels and very comfortable bedding. This is one of the best Hyatts you can book and only really beaten by Canaves Oia Epitome and the Ventana. The location was just incredible and felt straight out of a movie set. It was a hop and a skip to Kyomizu Dera as well.



Breakfast was a bit lean in terms of choice. There was a set list of items and you can order as much as you want. It was all really good, especially the breads that gave Park Hyatt Paris a run for its money. I would splurge the $20 for the Japanese Breakfast for atleast one day. I really enjoyed it and it’s made by a Michelin Star restaurant if that matters to you. I ordered mine a day ahead and AFAIK that’s the SOP if you want it. My goto ended up being over easy eggs, bacon(which was really pork belly), mixed altogether with the noodles(which had shrimp and bonito flakes). It was delicious and I did not get bored of eating it everyday.



The whole property made you feel special and it really does live up to all the hype. They left us some sort of local gift everyday from the most delicious grapes I have ever tasted to Japanese sweets made by a bakery 100s of years old.



It’s not exactly convenient to get around Kyoto from the PH but I think that’s more of an issue with just Kyoto. We took a cab almost everyday either to the specific place we were going and it was worth it to us since we only had 5 days in Kyoto. Service was top notch here as well where they ensured the cab drivers knew exactly where we were going. We were averaging 27,000 steps a day so this hotel was the perfect place to just relax after that. They had a champagne hour every day from 5pm to 6pm and I couldn’t stop eating the spiced walnuts haha.



**Conrad Osaka** - 5 nights. 5th Night Free, 380k HH


This is a Reddit darling and I can see why. They nail all the basics quite well. The lobby was a sight to behold with a panoramic view of Osaka skyline. Service definitely felt like a downgrade over the PH but this was a much cheaper property in terms of just cash price. We were “upgraded” to a city view and it was a pretty sizeable room with floor to ceiling view of Osaka. The toilet was in the powder room and much further away from the bathroom than I expected. Everything felt top notch in terms of material quality and reminded me how much I love Conrads(both NYC Conrads are lovely). 


Breakfast was a good spread but didn’t match the Hilton Tokyo. They had roast beef freshly cut daily and that was fantastic. Also had a generous amount of Shumai and shrimp dumplings which were also delicious. Wife had her matcha latte everyday and couldn’t get enough of it. She would have one for breakfast and get another one to go. 


People have been raving about the executive lounge for a long time so we had to check it out. It had a nice view of the city and plenty of seating. We really only used it once because Osaka just has so much to discover in terms of food that it didn’t make much sense to load up at the lounge. It’s perfect if you are craving a light snack but I wouldn’t make it a main source of food in Osaka. Easily the best lounge during our entire trip.


**Kozantei Ubuya** - 2 nights, $650/night including food. Paid cash.


Another hyped property on Reddit and elsewhere. It was not cheap at all and using their website was an absolute pain. They typically cater towards people staying just one night so booking 2 nights was complicated. We had to move rooms for the second day but they did move our stuff from the first room. Why 2 nights? Fuji is famously fickle and cannot be seen at all depending on the weather. We wanted to double our chances and we were thankful that we did. The first night had some of the worst weather we have had in Japan, it was rain mixed with fog and we couldn’t even tell where the mountain was. 


During breakfast the next day we saw the queen slowly coming out of the clouds and my god it was breathtaking. The view is THE REASON to book this property and we got it in spades. Throughout the day the clouds slowly dispersed till we had nothing obscuring Fuji. These 2 days were our forced relaxation day and what a way to spend it. We enjoyed our time in Kawaguchiko massively just relaxing in the hot tub and admiring the mountain. 


[Instagram Warning](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTEzNjA4OTU0NjQwMzY5?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=)

And [another one](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTEzNjA4OTU0NjQwMzY5?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=)



Our experience with food at the property was mixed. We had Shabu-Shabu one night and the beef was some of the best we have had all trip but then it was followed up by dessert which can best be described as custard laced with poison. Whatever sauce they used was incredibly bitter to the point of being inedible and kind of ruined the entire meal. Had similar experiences with the Kaiseki course too where a few dishes really knocked it out of the park and others should not be served to humans. You are bit of a captive since it’s a tourist town and everything was basically shut by 7pm.  Service was fine but can’t really be compared to Hilton or Hyatt. The plumbing was pretty rough with turning on one thing affected the pressure of the other. The pillows, as far as we understood, were made of buckwheat and easily some of the worst pillows I have ever used. 



If I did this again, I would stay at a much cheaper place with better food and just goto different viewpoints. We are not adventurous people and climbing the mountain is not something we are interested in at all.



**Andaz Tokyo** - 3 Nights at 30K/night for a total of 90k Hyatt Points(all from UR).



We were coming from Tokyo Station so this Hotel was really easy to get to. It was a sub 10 minute cab ride. Check in was fairly quick where they sit down with you in “the lounge” and go over Globalist perks. Once again, not much of an upgrade other than a “Park View” room. The room was basically encased in wood and has not aged well IMO. The wood is starting to show marks and dings and it doesn’t seem like the best material for bathrooms. The room itself was a decent size but felt devoid of any character when compared to something like the Conrad Osaka. 



I am still not sure what the hype is about with this property. Everything felt decidedly average compared to even Andazs in North America. There was nothing special about the service either. We actually really liked the location however since Toranomon Hills station can easily be accessed from underneath the hotel. Lots of great food and bar options nearby as well.



“The lounge” was basically a table with a water dispenser and a few snacks. The packaged rice snacks were delicious though and we did steal some for our flight back home. Breakfast was a combination of a buffet and several dishes you can order off a menu. The buffet did not change at all outside of the fruit selection. Nothing really stood out to us in terms of taste but the coffee was great to get the day started.



**Park Hyatt Tokyo** - 1 Night. 30k/night(all UR)

This was a mistake. Since I booked late, I couldn’t find 4 nights at the Andaz and decided to book the PH mostly due to Lost in Translation. Absolute waste of points. Service was basically non existent where we had to get out of the cab and go inside to find somebody to help with our bags. Did not have that happen anywhere during our trip. It only got worse from there. Finding the check in desk was complicated with no actual signage or people to ask any questions to. I have no idea how they are running this place with a skeleton crew. I finally found an area with a rep and asked if this is check in area and they said “yes, please sit and wait here”. After like 15 minutes another rep came over and asked “are you being helped?”. We said no and he asked us to wait. Another 10 minutes later, he was free. To be clear we were the only guests in the area and this was at 4:30PM.


While check in was going on I inquired about the room and about Globalist Upgrade(I hate doing this) and they had no idea that we were Globalist. He said he had to talk to his manager and returned 10 minutes later saying we can upgrade you to City View Room but we have to wait an hour for the room. I said fine and asked them to move all of our stuff to the new room(we had send ahead 4-5 bags). Just an overall mess of a property.



The room was a corner room and it would have been amazing in the early 2000s I guess. The bathroom hardware was yellowed and gross. The TVs were tiny. I am really struggling to think of anything good about this property. The location was awful since it was basically middle of nowhere in Nishi-Shinjuku and we actually walked to the Hilton Tokyo to take a train.



I deeply regretted not being able to find another night at the Andaz Tokyo. It was our last night in Tokyo and I wish it was better.

Just look up on the airline’s app, show flight in points, and you’re good. But I’m finding that’s not necessarily the case with airlines outside of the US. 

I’m trying to find a flight in June from somewhere in the US (preferably NYC) to Italy (preferably Rome or Florence). I started how I usually do: go to google flights, see what flights are out there, then go to the specific airlines and see what they charge with points. Mind you, I have chase, Amex and thank you points. But for certain airlines, like virgin and British air, their websites/results confuse me. It shows flights available sometimes, but with no prices? Or it just won’t show anything at all. At least with some websites you can get a calendar view if you’re flexible. Others are Singapore air, and Iberia air — can’t seem to figure it out.

I guess what I’m asking is, does anyone have any advice on how to search flights with BA, Virgin, or any other ones that might not be as straightforward? Like are these just problems on my end, or do other people know what I mean when I say it’s kinda confusing?

I knew it excludes most luxury cars, but the agreement states ""selected models of Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Cadillac, Infiniti, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, and Range Rover are covered"".

Unfortunately, I just got off the phone with a rep from Card Benefit Services who frustratingly was ""unable"" to send me a list of specific makes/models covered (or not) by the CDW benefit. It took me forever to try and go through a number of potential models (given I don't yet know exactly what I'll be renting) with her because of her accent and lack of fluent English, but I was surprised to learn it doesn't totally work the way I thought it would.

Understandably, most specialty lines (any BMW M series, Mercedes AMG) are not covered, but standard models are. However, when it comes to Audi, the S3, S5 &amp; SQ5 **are** covered but the A4 is **NOT** covered, which seems crazy to me given their MSRP (I had her confirm multiple times).

awardtravel,"I'm looking to book a flight for 2 from Detroit to Auckland, New Zealand in late January 2023. I've been saving points for a while now in hopes of booking Business/First class.  I have about 575,000 Chase UR points, and 90,000 United miles.  I don't have any airline status, but have the Chase Sapphire Reserve and Chase United Quest card if that helps.

I've read probably 100 blogs and guides of people's strategies for booking this kind of flight, and they all seem to make it happen for around 125k points/miles per person, each way. I've followed all the instructions but have essentially come to the following 3 unattractive options:

Reference Itinerary 

Depart (Jan 18th: DTW-AKL with stops in DEN and SFO. UA 2681, 521, 917)

Return (Jan 30th: AKL-DTW with stops in SFO and ORD. UA 916, 2145, 1195)

**Option 1.** Transfer Chase points to United and book Business class for 200,000 miles per person, each way (800,000 miles total) - would have to purchase the missing United miles. 

* *This route works out to be somewhere around $12,000+ depending on the Chase UR valuation.*

**Option 2.** Purchase Economy tickets through the Chase Travel portal (Fare H) using points for approximately 335,000 Chase UR points (\~$5,000), and then applying to be added to the Business Class Upgrade Waitlist on United's site for 120,000 miles and $2,100 in service fees.

* *This seems to leave it up to chance whether I would get awarded business seats, and I don't have any airline status to help move to the front of the line.*

**Option 3.** Purchase Business class tickets directly in the Chase travel portal for points + cash (\~575,000 Chase UR points + $5,000 cash). 

* *This isn't really an option - I would probably default to flying economy if this is the only route.*

I've researched non-United airlines as well, but don't have any way to transfer points to the other relevant options (namely American Airlines). 

I feel like I'm missing a big piece of the puzzle to get the most out of the reward points, so I'm considering reaching out to one of these Award Travel booking services. I wanted to throw this question out here just in case anyone had some advice for me before I go that route.

At the end of September, I called Chase with the intention to move some credit lines from my Chase Ink Preferred Card (CIP) to another Chase account. However, the customer service representative moved all the available credits from the CIP which ultimately resulted in the closure of the CIP account. I didn't realize this until I noticed my UR balance went to zero on the CIP, this was \~40 days after account closure. Per Chase's terms, you have 30 days of account closure to transfer the points out. 

I quickly called Chase's CSR as soon as I realized what has transpired. A ticket was created and escalated by a supervisor. Per all the supervisor conversations, the ticket was to be reviewed by the ""marketing/research team"". The next day, I went into my local branch and seek assistance from my CPC banker who made a few calls and sent out a few emails. 

During the next few days, I reached out to Chase's support team on twitter to see if there would be any quicker resolution in hopes of restoring my balance. All avenues of communication with Chase referred to the 30 day policy of moving points out of the account. A few days went by and I received the dreaded call from both Chase and my banker saying the ticket and the initial phone conversation back in September was reviewed but they could not reinstate my points. They mentioned the disclosure was read to me during the phone call etc etc. I quickly dialed Chase's number again and tried to find someone that had authority to somehow help me out. Nothing. Every call I made redirected me to pretty much the same Chase credit card service line. And from there, you can be transferred to a supervisor and that's the end of it. 

Feeling defeated, I reached out to a few of my friends in the hobby for assistance. One suggested I email an executive and see where the email goes. That night (\~10pm), I sent out probably 3-4 emails to executives. The next morning (\~9am), I received a call from a Chase Credit Card Executive saying, the email I sent out last night reached ""the right person"". He introduced himself and gave me his direct line, but what was most important was him saying that my points would be reinstated within 24 hours. All freaking 750K+ of it. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. In what I thought was the last attempt/hail mary...actually worked. 

Best believe I was checking my balance every few hours that day! 24 hours past since the executive call, my points balance was still sitting at zero. I gave the executive a call and mentioned it. He asked me to give him a few moments as he'll ask someone to make the balance reflect. 15 minutes after getting off the phone, I checked my account and every single point was back. He called me to confirm as well. It was truly a well rounded conversation and I mentioned to him there has to be a better, more automated way to resolve something like this. 

I wasn't planning on writing something like this, but hopefully this helps anyone that may experience my situation down the line. You just have to keep pushing and fighting! It was exactly a 1 week ordeal for me. 

TL;DR: My 750k UR balance went to zero after 30 days of closing an account. Chase customer service/supervisor/twittersupport/banker/securemessages etc could not reinstate my points.

I was hoping someone could answer a few questions:

1. Is there any limit on how far out I can book an EVA flight in the AirCanada system if it’s showing up? Basically, do reward fights open up for partner bookings right away, or does EVA hold some back for themselves even if they show on Air Canada’s website?

2. What’s the best way to cross-check that a reward flight exists before transferring points? I read somewhere to use United, but their calendar does not go out as far as Air Canada. So it is hard to take that approach if I want to book something as soon as it shows up in Air Canada’s schedule.

I’m open to any other tips and tricks people have. I really don’t want to make a silly mistake that I’ll regret down the road. Thanks in advance for any advice!",Using Aeroplan to book EVA J award ticket,,CalMaple,,0,11/21/2022 19:27

awardtravel,"So my SO lives across the country and I live in Seattle where Alaska is a major carrier. I'm planning on visiting her at least once per two months and if I time it properly I can snag round trip tickets for 200-250$ and that gives me almost 5000 miles each round trip. Assuming I switch between Delta Basic Economy (no mileage earning but can't pass the delta lounge access with amex plat for some food and drinks before and after a 6 hour flight coz centurion lounge pretty much sucks for us) and Alaska, I'm bound to make at least 3 trips per year on Alaska for the next two years and some extra trips during the holidays or my personal vacations which would amount to a conservative estimate of almost 40,000 miles.

I'm thinking of depositing this in Singapore airlines' Krisflyer so I can snag the 13.5k miles tickets to Hawaii on Alaska booked as SQ awards. But I'm looking for suggestion from the community if there's a better way/airline loyalty program to deposit this into?

Why deposit to Krisflyer?

1. 13.5k one way from Seattle to Hawaii sounds pretty good. (side question: I can book for my partner too with my miles right?)
2. Distance based charts on SQ for Alaska seems like a good thing since Seattle is my base.
3. If I'm low on miles, I can transfer my Amex MR or C1 VX miles to make up.
4. SQ is the only airline that flies from Seattle to my hometown in Asia with all segments as an International flight so journeys are comfortable without long delays when connecting from international to domestic flights and don't have to deal with baggage checkin during connections. Would be taking some international trips on SQ when tickets are not that expensive since they run 1.3k-1.5k generally while tickets to other airports in my home country from Seattle generally cost 800-1k.

Negatives:

1. SQ has 3 years for miles expiry so should something change, won't be able to get the most out of my miles in Krisflyer.
2. Deposit these miles in Alaska account itself and gain some MVP status for benefits but afraid I might not use the benefits much when I'm always picking saver fares and no backup when I don't have enough miles for award tickets. (any rebuttals?)
3. Came across some reports on flyertalk that they are not able to book Alaska flights through SQ after talking to the customer support.
4. Avios seems like another good option since it also offers distance based charts and 13k tickets to hawaii on Alaska or American. (anything I'm overlookin?)

Some random details or info:

1. Upcoming domestic vacation trips within the next two to three years would be Vegas, Austin, San Diego, Hawaii, NYC, all mostly from Seattle and might drive to Canada.
2. Upcoming international trips to Korea, Japan, Singapore and India within the next three years and willing to try business class on ANA product using awards.

Also this is my first time plunging into the journey of miles and redemptions and taking this very passionately haha. My past redemptions have included buying a box of baklava at the DXB airport using my emirates skywards, pretty lame but I just couldn't figure it out lol

Lets say I buy a ware at a store with an Amex credit card. The purchase generates Eurobonus points which are added to my Eurobonus account.

2. The money  is transfered to another seperate bankaccount, or i get it cash in hand at the store.

awardtravel,"I figured I would share my bookings for some data points. I initially had no plans for international travel this winter, I missed out on the UA 60k J to NZ several months ago and figured I would just do some snowboarding stateside with Ikon pass.

I stumbled upon the B6 ""sale"" fare for QR J ex-DPS last month and figured I would join in on it and just see if it would go through, booking Jan 4 departure. (it did not and I got refunded from expedia/B6 about a week later). But I started looking for positioning flights that week and to build an potential trip.

I stumbled upon Dec 18 LAX - (B6 J) - JFK - (JL F) - HND for 95k AA miles. I figure it priced online as 80k for NA - Asia 1 for F, and 15k extra for mint. I called into AA to try to add on a HND - CTS flight with the intention of snowboarding in Niseko, they were unable to add and wanted to reprice the ticket to 145k (65k + 80k). So while I wasnt able to add on a domestic japan flight, I did HUCA and was able to get it ticketed at 95k, AA desk agreed to honor the online pricing.

I was also able to find DL awards for dec25-29 KIX-TPE, dec31 TPE - DPS/CGK for 35k/45k in J on CI, and I think these are pretty nicely priced partner awards for Skypesos.

well, DPS-DOH-DFW was cancelled, so I was wondering if I was going to keep planning the trip or if I was going to just cancel the AA award. I am now planning on spending NYE with friends in SFO, so I look at making it back stateside by dec 31. I find TPE-YVR CI J on dec27 for ~90k flyingblue. I set up alerts on seats.aero for ex-TPE and ex-TYO. I miss a dec28 TPE-SEA on EVA J, but a couple days ago I find dec27 TPE-YVR EVA J, I decide to lock that in, transferring 69k UR +30% bonus to book the EVA J + dec30 YVR-SFO AC Y. I book 2  DL J awards for japan-TPE while I firm up plans. I use AMEX plat to book a YVR hotel w/ 3rd night free + $200 statement credit.

Next for me is to decide how long I stay at each location and transfer UR to book hyatt hotels.

TLDR

able to find these 6-10 weeks out

DEC18 95K AA miles LAX-JFK-HND on B6 J / JL F

possible DEC25 35k DL skymiles NRT-TPE on CI 77W J

possible DEC27 35k DL skymiles KIX-SGN-TPE on VN A350 J / CI 77W J

DEC27 69k UR+30%-&gt;aeroplan TPE-YVR on EVA 77W J  | YVR - SFO AC Y

surprisingly all of these would be new products for me besides AC Y, with JL F being my first international F.

with a relatively short connection between SGN-TPE and TPE-YVR, I would forego bringing my own snowboarding gear, esp with the high cash cost of staying in niseko and just spend time with friends and family in TYO/kyoto/osaka.

awardtravel,"The list was initially compiled when I lived GMT +12, so dates might be off a day.

Sometimes time zones make a difference if you want to snag an award that is released on a schedule. Generally, if the booking airline is the limiting one, it will be released according to their time zone. If the operating carrier is the limiting one, there is a higher chance it will be released based on the operating carrier's time zone. As a general rule, an airline cannot book partner award space before they open up bookings for their own space. Qantas is one exception to this rule.

Please help complete this list. It is old and out of date. Feel free to correct dates, add airlines, or add dates.

**Edit: How to use this list.** If you are booking a partner award, look at the line for the airline you are looking to fly **and** the airline that operates the mileage program you are booking through. The lower of the two numbers is when you can book the seat. Example: Booking JAL via AA. JAL seats become available at 360 days, and AA allows booking 331 days out. You can book these seats 331 days out. Remember that the time zone of the more restricted airline/program is what matters.

If you are trying to book a seat with a program that does not allow you to book at schedule opening, like the JAL example. You can check JAL's website at 331+ to get an idea of what seats will be available when AA gets access to JAL's space.

**The exact time of day does matter for some bookings. Please leave any time DP you have in the comments. Please add to the list if you know of additional airline dates.**

I’m sure there are probably other availabilities as well through these travel partners alliances but the portals make it very difficult to see, so the only sure fire way is to call each airline to confirm.

So on October 3rd I booked a flight using virgin miles during the transfer promo for a steal. This was the itinerary: December 7th Flight KL642 JFK to AMS 6hr 5min layover and then Dec 8th KL1273 from AMS to POZ.  I was checking the seat arrangement on the KLM website a couple of days ago and realized that my flights had been changed to DL046 JFK to AMS and kept the second part. This was strange as the virgin website showed the original itinerary. Also the Delta website shows the itinerary but says it hasn't been issued. When I called virgin about this they were unable to contact KLM and said that they could refund me, which wouldn't help me at all. I also called KLM and Delta and they referred me back to virgin.

- [Flight Connections](https://www.flightconnections.com/route-map-star-alliance)
    - Useful to get an understanding of different routes.  You can access alliance maps through the hamburger icon at the top-right or by following the link above for the Star Alliance map. 
- [United’s Search Tool](https://www.united.com/en/us)
    - Useful for quickly seeing days with (i) business class availability.  The trick is to look for the cheapest points options.  Make sure you’re not logged in!
- [award.flights](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awardflights/cgkmhlnbmfjmlplmcdnannneiplmjiba)
    - Useful to double-check the availability found using United’s Search Tool.  award.flights automates the entry and navigation of ANA’s Search Tool.
- [ITA Software Matrix Airfare Search](https://matrix.itasoftware.com/search)
    - Helpful in estimating carrier imposed surcharges.  I had estimated it would be $1112.70 and it came out to be $899.40 + $25 (booking fee)
    - Some tips:
        - Extension Codes: Alliance Star-Alliance
        - Stops: Nonstop only
        - Extra stops: No extra stops
        - Cabin: Business class or higher
        - Allow airport changes: uncheck
        - Only show flights and prices with available seats: checked
- [Great Circle Mapper](http://www.gcmap.com/)
    - Helpful in estimating distance for the trip.  There are reports the gcmap don’t match ANA’s itinerary mileage.  Ballpark number was enough for my purposes of determining how many points to transfer from Amex to ANA.

    - Great weather information including visuals.

## Misc.
- Award availability can disappear, even when looking about a year out, sometimes by other folks who are booking those seats and other times by the carriers.  Originally I was planning on going LAX-NRT-ICN or DEN-NRT-ICN which both had (i) business class availability on UA metal for the LAX-NRT and DEN-NRT segments per United’s Search Tool and was visible on ANA.  Some time before I finalized our itinerary, Untied decided to pull the availability.  This required me to go back to the drawing board for the trans-pacific leg.
- Point transfers from Amex to ANA took a little less than 48 hours.  I initiated the transfer from Amex to ANA at 10am PST on day 0 and they were in my ANA account at 6:30am PST on day 2.  I’m not sure exactly what time they arrived on day 2.
- ANA hold times are long, but not as long as I expected.  I called at around noon PST on a Sunday.  It took a little less than 1 hour to get a hold of a representative, and a little less than 30 minutes to feed the information to the representative and for me to ask a few questions that I had.  The representative was competent and helpful.  A different representative called me about 3 hours later to get my credit card information for payment and to ticket the reservation thereafter.
- If Taiwan travel restrictions ease before I take this trip, I plan on changing the TPE layover into a stopover.  The ANA agent confirmed this would be permitted as doing so wouldn’t violate any of their rules.

Following some instructions I saw from a podcast about how to book ANA because of terrible availability, I booked a round trip flight on business class for next fall for Tokyo to SFO and then a return flight from SFO to Tokyo. According to the instructions, this is supposed to be in order to book SFO to Tokyo as far out as possible, and then it said you call them later and change the first leg of the trip to a later date for when you actually want to return once ANA allows bookings that far out.

I called ANA today and they said of course you can't just switch the order of your flights. they said I have to fly Tokyo to SFO first. So now it seems like I'm stuck as there's no way for me to be in Tokyo first in order to take this flight out. So just wondering if there's anything I can do, like maybe get a refund on half the trip and treat the SFO to Tokyo I actually want to take as a one way, or something. 

I also thought about taking the loss and getting an economy or some other one way flight home and then just not taking the Tokyo to SFO flight. But I'm worried if you don't take the first part of a round trip they'll cancel the return flight or something.

We are booking a very last minute trip to Europe from NYC (ideally EWR) departing 11/9. I see 2 + 2 seats on UA - either 2 on the 8:15 in J and 2 on the 11:00 pm in J; or 2 in business 2 in economy. Either way we could get to LON.

I can't seem to figure out a return from LON - have tried all the usual tricks, different airlines/alliances, paying with points, etc., and there are no good deals. Would even be willing to fly coach on the return.

The best I can seem to find is 42.4k UA miles per person LHR-EWR. Even the cash prices in Y are ~$1800 one way. Ironically the economy redemption is 4+ cpp.

So my two-part question is, first, if anyone can help me find a better return deal from LON on 11/13 - or, alternatively, maybe a different r/t altogether to Europe departing 11/9 and returning 11/13. I've been trying various options including on point.me but that site is quite slow and doesn't search multi-city codes (like NYC or LON) so quite time consuming.

In response to the standard questions:

1. O/D fixed in the sense we need to fly out of NYC;
2. 4 travelers but could do 2 + 2 as I say above.
3. looking for one way LON-NYC or a different r/t altogether;
4. Class of service Y on the LON-NYC would be ok; on the overnight to Europe prefer J;
5. Have plenty of points in all currencies - like 1.5M MR; 750k UR; 300k UA; 500k AA; etc. But not looking to blow everything on this one last minute trip.

Still very much a beginner in this realm and trying to find out the best way to book award flights for next fall's journey of NZ --&gt; Japan --&gt; Europe --&gt; USA.  I've been looking into various RTW options, but it seems like that itinerary would only qualify for two:
Qantas and Air Canada
ANA - won't be returning to same continent
CX - wont be returning to same point of departure
Aeromexico - won't be returning to same country
Singapore - won't be ending in the same country as it started

The AC and QF options are more just long multi-city pairings or using the stopover feature, but in some initial searches I couldn't find much.  Are there any other programs out there I'm not thinking of?  I thought of UA Excursionist perk, but since its only for intra-region travel it didn't seem that great for my purposes.

awardtravel,"Hello,

Thank you in advance for your help. 

I am trying to fly one-way from the US NE (BOS/JFK/IAH) to the UK next August (pretty flexible on dates and departure/arrival location). I have 150k Amex MR points and want to use them for this trip, I also have a lot of bags (I am moving) so I figured booking a business class flight would be the best use of my time. 

After reviewing this article from TPG ([https://thepointsguy.com/guide/sweet-spots-american-express-membership-rewards/](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/sweet-spots-american-express-membership-rewards/)) I have narrowed in on the Virgin Atlantic search engine on the best way to book this flight, however, all flights entering the UK seem to have a fixed fee of $876. 

* JFK to LHR w/ Virgin Atlantic (only option for this route) - Aug 14 (57,500+ $876)

These rates are consistent for Manchester, Edinburgh and all London airports from Christmas all the way until August.

I have tried departing and arriving in multiple airports as well as using the tip from Frequent Miler ([https://frequentmiler.com/how-to-book-delta-flights-with-virgin-atlantic-miles/#US\_to\_UK\_Award\_Chart](https://frequentmiler.com/how-to-book-delta-flights-with-virgin-atlantic-miles/#US_to_UK_Award_Chart)) and have replaced ""dates"" in the URL with ""calendar"" in order to see entire months at a time. 

The only reasonable flights I have found are entering the EU, such as those below:

* EWR to CDG w/ Air France - Aug 14 (58,500 Points + $266)
*  BOS to AMS w/ KLM - Aug 8 ( 58,500 Points+ $267)

However, for complicated visa reasons, I need to fly into the UK, is there any way around this when booking with Virgin Atlantic? Or any other way to use MR points to book this trip without dropping $500+ on fees?

awardtravel,"Hi, 

So my partner and i have been researching going to Europe, specifically London on July 5th, and Returning from Paris on July 15 or 16th. We are flying from San Diego and were looking up prices and how many miles it would cost either economy or business and were wondering if it would be better to book with one carrier for both flights, or more beneficial to book lets say with British Airways for outbound, and Air France for inbound.

We have about 130k Amex points and 100k Capital One Points. Ideally were trying to get these flights for free and if possible upgrade. 

Also wondering if there is a certain time before flights where using points would be more beneficial or worth more.

I looked up and for multi city, it would be around $1300 economy if i bought right now, don't know if its too far out and it'll get cheaper later.

A while ago I was looking at booking a flight from USA to EU. I saw a flight I liked and had an email from AMEX with a transfer bonus to KLM. So I transferred and went to book the flight only it was gone. When I inquired, they said they only allow certain flights to be used with points (which is ridiculous IMO). Anyway, now I still just have them lying there and won't use KLM or AirFrance to fly to EU. 

What can I do with them? Are they transferable to Delta? Or other Airlines? I did look at booking a hotel somewhere here with them, but hotels for one night in Kansas were like 100,000 points a night!

I am planning to book our dream honeymoon on Marriott Bonvoy Points, and have a question about **how many** ***purchased points*** **can I receive per calendar year?**  

I've been reading the Marriott points Help Page like crazy and found 2 conflicting statements. If I have some loved ones buy marriott points, I see that they can purchase and transfer a max of 100,000 points. But my Big Question is can I receive 100,000 points purchased in TOTAL per calendar year OR 500,000 purchased points? Or does the 500,000 points to be received have to be **earned** points?

I copied the Marriott statements for reference: 

* **Members may purchase OR receive as a gift a combined maximum of 100,000** Marriott Bonvoy® Points per calendar year when purchased through Marriott websites, Marriott Bonvoy® Mobile Apps or the Customer Engagement Centers.
* Members may **purchase up to an additional 100,000 Points annually** while booking a Hotel Stay through the Reservation path on the Marriott website.
* **New Member**s may purchase Points thirty (30) days after enrollment in the Marriott Bonvoy® program.
* Purchased Marriott Bonvoy® Points are non-refundable

awardtravel,"I'm helping my brother book his honeymoon, and of course he has chosen the most difficult option--business class to Japan. He and his wife will fly out of FLL or MIA, so they will need positioning flights. I've found outgoing availability on ANA from Vancouver to Tokyo, and incoming availability from Tokyo to San Francisco. I'm looking at the various Star Alliance partners for booking in order to avoid ANA's obscene fuel surcharges (and both are showing as available on Aeroplan). 

My question is, is there any method of booking that would allow me to include the positioning flights as part of the same itinerary--so that Vancouver and San Francisco would act more like stopovers, and I'm not having to book him additional expensive flights? Aeroplan says that they don't allow stopovers within the US or Canada, so that won't work. He is using Membership Rewards so United miles aren't an option.

Because of this, I'm contemplating repositioning from our Home Airport (HNL) to Chicago. Then taking Etihad to Abu Dhabi Business class. To make it even further around the world I'm utilizing Air Canada's stop-over policy giving me Business class to BKK for pennies. for that portion, I'm happy with the miles at 92.5k a person plus 106 dollars in Fees.  Now here is the part I'm not entirely sure about, We'd like to head to Tokyo next then finally back home. Utilizing Air Canada I'm able to complete that portion for 55k (Econ) or 80k (mixed) for most of the flights direct to Tokyo and direct Tokyo to Honolulu. All these flights would be ANA and Business class would be BKK--&gt;NRT. If I was to do Business class portion 1 and Mixed portion 2 I'd walk out spending 172.5k points plus 190 dollars (per person).

The last remaining piece is Europe back to North America, which has been trickier.

I'm wondering, instead of booking the award ticket directly, would it potentially make sense to just book a roundtrip on UA and use miles or pluspoints to upgrade, then for the return leg, keep pushing out when it is until I actually need it (and also use miles / pluspoints to upgrade that one)? I'm sure I'll be back in Europe next year, and I guess I can figure out the last return leg then if award availability is better.

I will need to go back to Europe next year so I can make use of the return leg and could probably get that one upgraded with miles / PP as well and currently UA doesn't charge me change fees so I can just keep pushing it until I make use of it (I'm not sure if the no change fee / refund is a COVID thing or a Platinum status thing, but next year I'll either be Gold or Silver as I haven't really needed to travel for work)  

There might be more award availability for a Europe-US return leg (which I would still need to figure out) by then as more planes are brought out of storage / delivered

Anyway, the plan is to book for me via AA for 37.5K miles +$18 in Economy and cancel it when I hit the SUB on my AS Biz and ultimately book the same seat via AS in economy and upgrade to first 2 weeks out (99.999% sure AA is fully refundable, including taxes and fees).

* QR Qsuites (A350) IAH-DOH via LAX &amp; PHX (routing due to reduce flights because of covid I assume) booked \~10 mo out AA 70K. Qsuites was my #1 goal once I got into churning and I wanted to make it my first redemption. Qsuites was everything I hoped &amp; expected. Service and food both great. Seat was very comfortable and I appreciated they still had individual air nozzles. 15hrs went by faster than I imagined. Food highlights were the slow roasted beef cheeks and the dulce de leche for dessert. My only “complaint” was the boarding process is a little sluggish/disorganized, but I’ve seen that mentioned multiple times before. Wifi was only $10 for the whole flight and worked pretty well.
* QR J (777) DOH-FRA not as glamorous as Qsuites but solid product.Booked via AA for 42.5K Luckily I was seated by myself for the flight. 2-2-2 config was kinda dated but oh well. Food was great (finally had the mezze) and service was attentive. Again, boarding precess was slightly less than ideal, this time is was due to the transfer buses.
* SQ F Suites (A380) FRA-JFK seat 2F Originally booked in J at saver price of 72K when all the “blogs” started posting about it. I transferred and extra 14K in hopes of finding F award space. Booked in late Nov and found F saver space (86K) on Christmas evening. Amazing is the only thing I can say right now about the flight. I’ll try to keep it relatively short. SQ staff are so personable and really make you feel at home. They are happy to show you all the features of your suite and even happier to take photos of/with you. They are very attentive but not overbearing. The suites are HUGE. PDB was ’08 Dom P &amp; it was great. The chicken satay was delicious; enjoyed the caviar more than I imagined for my first time( they even offered me a second serving immediately after. Main was beef cheeks again and desert was a chocolate sorbet. Not a huge desert guy but I tried them on each airline. QR’s definitely wins. Wrapping it up, the bathrooms (bigger one on the right) is massive, the bed was comfortable enough for me; the cabin did get a little hot/stuffy but I didn’t mind too much. Wifi was free for Suites passengers. Not quite as fast as QR’s IMO but free is free. Can’t wait to do this again but hopefully on a longer route.
* Jet Blue Y JFK-DEN seat 7. First time on B6, booked when there was a cheap sale for one ways. Nothing exciting but I’ll give them points for having free wifi on a low cost carrier.
* UA Y DEN-IAH 12.5K UR Via SQ. Nothing to write home about.

\*\*Lounges(May)\*\*

* Admirals Club at both IAH &amp; PHX nothing to write home about. The PHX location might have been even smaller than the already small IAH lounge.
* Centurion Lounge Terminal TBIT LAX- we’ve all heard enough about this location. Definitely not an accurate representation of the brand.
* Al Mourjan Lounge DOH was very nice, albeit fairly busy for 5:30/06:00 am. Got a seat towards the back and had a couple glasses of champagne and a cappuccino. For food I had the Eggs Royal and then some other offerings from the “buffet"" area. I would love to be there when it is quieter though.
* LH Senator Lounge FRA Terminal 1 idk what I expected, but expected more. Very minimal food offerings, eggs looked worse than a standard hotel breakfast. Lounge is pretty big and very close to the gate which I appreciate. Coffee was solid and I did like the draft beer and smoking area INSIDE the lounge in keeping with true German fashion.
* Centurion Lounge JFK T4 tried to go pretty early but they were enforcing the 3hr prior rule so she mentioned the Virgin club is downstairs &amp; to check that out for the time being. After leaving the Virgin club I would only have about 30-40mins in here so I could make it back to T5, of course today was the day when only one air train was running for all stops. Luckily as I was leaving my flight was delayed by 30-40 mins so I was able to check out 1850 and grab some food. The food here is the 2nd best I’ve had in a lounge. First being reserved for AA Flagship First JFK.
* Virgin Atlantic clubhouse T4 lounge was very quiet at 9am. that soon changed about 30 mins later. Lounge is pretty tucked away as well. Service was pretty decent when ordering through the app.

\*\*Hotels(May\*\*

* 1 Night at Park Hyatt Doha originally thought I booked on points (as I did almost everything else this trip) but ended up paying cash since it was pretty cheap &amp; a better use than points. Cash rate was about $210. Only a discoverist so keep that in mind. My first experience at the park Hyatt and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Room was very nice and spacious and stocked with Le Labo products. Location is not too far from the airport and pretty close to Souq Waqif and other shopping areas.
* 5 nights at Hyatt House Eschborn 23.5K UR. Wasn’t too far out from the city &amp; I didn’t want to stay at the Hyatt regency at the airport due to me wanting to knock off more hotels for the brand explorer. Room was nice; had a kitchen with stove, dishwasher etc. They also had self serve W&amp;D which I greatly appreciated before packing up to leave. Hotel breakfast was….a hotel breakfast; but it was free.
* 1 Night TWA Hotel paid cash $260 for a standard King. Also had to “book” pool access. I went at my time and they had a “private party” &amp; didn’t allow anyone in regardless of reservation. The whole stay was sorta a waste and food is very expensive. I didn’t want to go into the city but should’ve just gotten a hotel anyway.
* 2 Nights Hyatt Centric Denver 24K UR std king room. Received a high floor and corner room, with only 1 room across the hall. Room had a decent view of the downtown area. There is a nice rooftop terrace and a restaurant/bar downstairs but I didn’t try it out. Hotel is in a pretty central location close/in the RiNO district.
* 1 Night Hilton Art Hotel Denver VIA FHR. Diamond status Via the Aspire. Booked 1 King bd Mountain View. Was upgraded at check in to 1 King Bd Mountain View corner suite. Suite has a separate dining and desk area with bed around the corner facing Broadway street. Std FHR amenities applied, $100 F&amp;B as well as $30 for breakfast at 4pm checkout. Food at the Fire restaurant for dinner and breakfast above average imo. Had the Bone marrow, NY Strip, &amp; a cheese cake for dinner. I did see a comment in here abut them not cooking steaks correctly to temp &amp; that is still true; asked for medium and it was definitely closer to medium well.
* 1 Night Grand Hyatt Denver 12K UR solid stay. Decor and room did “WOW” me and I don’t necessarily have any cons about the stay.

\*\*Flights(July)\*\*

* UA Y IAH-IAD 12.5 K UR Via SQ
* SN Y IAD-BRU 27K MR Via EY
* KLM Y BRU-AMS 7K UR
* EK F 777 BRU-DXB 85K MR Security &amp; Passport control went by really quick due to fast track at BRU. The Lounge was meh (Covered below). This flight was REALLY fun. Originally had seat 1K but the FA’s suggested 2K since its a little further back from the galley. I can’t really compare it to SQ F because they are so different and I really don’t want pick just one. The fully enclosed suite is really nice &amp; pretty spacious as well, but not as spacious as SQ. My FA was amazing throughout the whole flight which was actually really short. Barely 6hr from BRU. You should definitely try to get a longer flight &amp; leave from DXB but that will be for next time. BVLGARI amenity kit was fully loaded &amp; even contained a nice sized cologne. I’m quite sure I finished at least a bottle &amp; a half of Dom P. I wasn't turning down any of the refills. Caviar was on par with SQ. The only fault I had with the whole service was the main course of steak which was definitely overcooked. I have read time &amp; time again that it is overcooked &amp; that is still true. I finished the Meal service with some Hennessy Paradis &amp; Johnnie Walker Blue. By this time the flight was nearly over &amp; I felt sorta bad for having the FA make my bed but I just wanted to see how it felt &amp; it was pretty comfortable for the limited time I did lay down. I definitely want to do the A380 now &amp; check out eh lunge in Dubai.
* RJ Y DXB-AMM-FRA Via AA for 20K I messed up and missed my KLM flight from DXB-AMS &amp; was kinda freaking out. I had tried out [Point.me](https://Point.me) a few days prior to see what my options were to come home. My dates were flexible &amp; was holding out for LH F EX Europe but there was ZERO. They came in handy when i was frantically trying to find my way to anywhere in europe to finish my trip. I 100% percent wasn't even thinking of using AA miles in this situation. I""ll gladly pay $5 again for a day pass.
* SAS Y CPH-IAD Via Avianca
* UA Y IAD-IAH Via UA Travel Bank

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lounges(July)\*\*

* Turkish Lounge IAD. I’ve heard this is the best priority pass lounge at IAD and I would agree. It is TINY and suffers from big crowds though. The I initially tried to enter they stated they were at capacity and to come back in 1.5 hours. They also stated to check out the BA lounge. BA said to kick rocks, they’re not open &amp; to go check out Lufthansa. Lufthansa said no entry. Circled back to Turkish and a handful of people were leaving &amp; got to enter.
* Brussels Diamond Lounge Terminal B. Lounge is actually fairly big. Food options were limited but tasted decent enough. I wouldn’t go too far out of my way to spend a bunch of time in here though. There are two separate seating/dining areas separated by the food area in the middle. I do appreciate the multiple options for draft beer as well as bottled beer. There were a few options for wines/champagne as well but I was saving myself for EK F dining.
* Ahlan Business Class lounge DXB Terminal 1 these priority pass restaurants are killing the U.S equivalent. This lounge was very spacious &amp; had the best food I’ve had in a priority pass lounge. There was also small area for “mini” hot entrees as well as an ice cream &amp; slushee machine. The bar area was in the back &amp; looked well stocked &amp; there was a cold drink area with various sodas &amp; nice beer
* Crown Lounge Amman- Another huge lounge that basically covers the whole 4th floor of the check in/duty free area. I didn’t have any food but this also had an ice cream machine &amp; amenities i haven’t seen anywhere such as a pizza bar &amp; made to order coffee bar. There was also some Italian “cart” that had desserts but wasn’t open until 1pm
* Eventyr Lounge T3 Non-schengen area. Lounge is pretty spacious with nice views all around of the apron. It was quite dark in here, but that is also partially due to the weather not letting much light in. The food was the typical European hotel/lounge spread of cold cuts, powdered egg etc. I do appreciate the beer &amp; decent coffee though. Lounge was VERY quiet for a Friday morning. There was less than 20 people inside the whole time I was there.

\*\*Hotels(July)\*\*

* 1 Night Hyatt Regency Dulles 5K UR nothing major to write about here. Stay wasn’t memorable but not in a bad way. They do have an airport shuttle which could have save me the $25/4mi uber. Definitely utilized for the way out.
* 1 night Steigenberger Wiltcher FHR Very nice hotel located in Avenue Louise area which has TONS of high end shopping. Got “upgraded” from base room booked which was a king bd Deluxe room to a two double bed “superior room” Guess that’s they game we play with upgrades. Room had a nice view of the courtyard and received $85 F&amp;B credit as well as the usual FHR benefits.
* 1 night Marriott Brussels grand Palace Marriott FNC (Deluxe King Guest Room) Hotel located in a pretty busy area. Room was pretty small but more or less European standards. Room was even hotter than the Steigenberger with the A/C on. It’s about a 10 ish min walk from centraal station which was really nice when I left early in the AM to head to the airport.
* 1 Night Hyatt Regency Amsterdam 24K UR (std suite) Booked this when I was still a discoverist. Currently in the middle of the latest Explorist/Globalist challenge that came out so I am an explorist at the moment. I received Club lounge access at check in. I have 2 club lounge awards for the milestone reward but I certainly didn’t call to use them nor did i even mention them. Breakfast is also provided but I skipped. Regardless i had ample room in the suite &amp; a slight view of some canal. Also got some chocolates &amp; bottle of wine for the welcome amenity. I really liked this hotel and would definitely stay here again. One bad note is that the wifi is pretty terrible
* 1 Night Andaz Amsterdam 25K UR Booked base room 1 king Bd Atrium view &amp; was upgraded to king bd Garden View room the day before arrival. Garden view does have a better view based on pics from website &amp; you can’t book into this room on points so upgrade was certainly appreciated. Location is even better than the regency. Really close to many of the coffee shops, food places and museums that I had on my list.
* 1 “Night” Canal House (SLH) 25K UR my first time at an SLH property. Access is pretty controlled, from the street you have to be buzzed in by reception. They then took my bags &amp; had me wait in the waiting area which is behind the bar/reception area. I received a welcome “shot” and a cold towel. After they grabbed my ID &amp; CC he explained how to access the hotel. It’s controlled through an online login called “guest key”. From there you swipe to enter the hotel or your room. Booked into the Good room at 25K/night. No upgrade but was able to check in about 2 hours early. One thing to note is the lights were not working in my room for a little bit when i checked in.
* 1 Night Hilton Garden Inn Brussels $99/night. Diamond status. Option to choose between breakfast or points. Chose points. Given a welcome bag consisting of a water, a beer, &amp; 2 snacks. Some of the people were kind of loud late into the night (11:30) PM but it settled down &amp; was able to get decent sleep. There is a train stop about a 2 min walk from the hotel which is great.
* 1 Night The St. Regis Dubai FNC (Deluxe King Room, City View) used I believe a 50K FNC from the Marriott Biz Card. Day of arrival received a message in the app that my room was upgraded. Gold status via Amex Plat so surprised. I was now in the Grand Deluxe King Room w/ City View. \~ $60/might room upgrade. This was my first stay at an upper tier Marriott property and I was really impressed. The hotel itself was beautiful &amp; my room was amazing. The view was just ok but considering I got in after midnight it was a. Non factor. The staff were excellent as well. Breakfast the next morning was a pretty substantial buffet as well as a la carte items. The view of the pool, made it even better.
* 2 Nights Al Maha 170K Marriott WOW! Easily the top “hotel” experience I’ve ever had. I don’t know if you can still call this a hotel but I am still in awe. I will try to keep it short. I was able to check in about 2 hours early on my first day. Check in went smoothly &amp; I was asked if I wanted to request late checkout subject to availability. I of course requested it &amp; the receptionist said she would get back to me about. Again, only Gold status so I wasn’t expecting it; but she did state the hotel was at about 40% capacity. (After lunch on day 2 I was told I could have until 2pm in the suite.) Anyway, the first day I did my first activity which as the camel trek. It was windy enough &amp; sand was blowing everywhere that it slightly took away from the experience but I still a a great time. It also the desert so I can’t really complain about it. The “sandstorm” was also why I didn’t get into the pool the first day as well. To keep me from rambling further; All the food for Breakfast, Lunch, &amp; Dinner is outstanding; you cannot go wrong with any choice. The staff are remarkable &amp; make sure to seamlessly anticipate your need &amp; the activities are quite fun &amp; informational. I 100% want to go back ASAP.
* 2 nights Hyatt Place Frankfurt. Hotel is located right by the train station 1-2 stops away from Frankfurt airport on the S8/S9. Paid cash. Room is solid enough for \~$133/night.
* 2 nights Story hotel Malmo Nice hotel about a 5-10 min walk from Malmo central station. Breakfast is included in room rates. Breakfast wasn’t that good, but it was free. It’s served in the same Japanese restaurant on the 14th floor. At check in i received a 100 SEK voucher to use at the restaurant &amp; most things looked closed when i arrived so i used it that night. Food &amp; drink were decent, but wouldn’t be my first choice. They also have portable Wi-Fi battery packs that you can use. I didn’t need them since i use Google fi when abroad (at least this trip i did) but it’s a nice plus.","Booked: Europe &amp; UAE (Qsuites, EK F, etc..)",,TT2316,,6,8/8/2022 18:46

awardtravel,"Hi all,

Sorry if this isn't the best place, but I'm not sure where else to ask! Recently, I got stranded in Newark flying back to the states from Lisbon, Portugal for a funeral. I ended up needing to rent a car and driving from Newark to Indiana.

I filed a claim with United and used the European EU complaint form. I just received an email from them and they have offered me a few different redemption options. I don't know much about the different options and I'm still processing the trauma to be frank (luggage was lost, had to get my own hotel, walked into the hospital just after she died, etc.).

To quote from the email:

&gt;First and foremost thank you for your  loyalty and for reaching out to us.

 

&gt;Thank you for your patience while we reviewed the circumstances surrounding the disruption to your travel plans on June 1, 2022 from Newark NJ to Louisville , KY.  Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience you incurred.

 

&gt;Please send me your car rental receipt. Once I review them, I will let you know what will be reimbursed.

&gt;As alternative options to your claim for compensation under Regulation EC 261/2004 (EU261), we would like to offer you the choice between an $1,000.00 (USD) United Travel Certificate (redeemable and transferable toward the purchase of flights operated by United, United Express, or United codeshare partners) or 50,000 United Mileage Plus® miles (redeemable on flights operated by United, United Express or by Air Canada, ANA, Austrian, Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian, Swiss, Thai, and 20 additional Star Alliance partners worldwide).

&gt;To view additional Mileage Plus® services and award options within the world's largest network, including Star Alliance and our other global partners, please visit us at: http://www.united.com/mileageplus. Travel Certificates expire December 31, 2023, and Mileage Plus® miles do not expire.  If you would like to select one of these options, please let us know your preference, and we'll facilitate delivery via e-mail within 3-5 business days.

&gt;However, if you still wish to pursue monetary compensation under EU261 in the amount of EUR600, please provide a valid address where we can send it. You will receive your compensation in the form of a USD check. The processing of your payment may take up to six weeks. 

This all sounds really nice, but we still haven't been reimbursed for the hotel stay either, so I'm not sure if we are coming out ahead or not. Regardless, which of these would you find most valuable?

Thank you so much!!","I know y'all have a tough reputation, so please take it easy on me trying to decide which redemption route I should take with United.",,marxr87,,27,8/8/2022 14:55

awardtravel,"Newbie here. My family of 3 is traveling July 1, 2023 MCI to ATH, then will return to MCI from FCO.  I doubled down on Delta and got the Platinum Amex for 100K points because of their relative reliability and am now concerned about getting reasonably priced tickets even with the points.  It's too early to plug in travel dates that far out, but I know flying during the July 4 holiday is not ideal for scoring a deal.  Questions:

* Am I correct that selecting Multi-city is the way to go instead of two one-way flights?
* Since we're flying from MCI, would it make sense to get the Southwest Rapid Rewards card and use those points to get me to JFK or whatever hub, then use the Delta points to do the international part?  I want to get the companion pass while I'm at it, so it seems as though I'd need to get both the personal and business cards to get enough points for that (I believe another $99 and $199 in fees, plus I've spent $250 on the Delta AMEX).  But if I time it right, I'd have the companion pass for virtually all of 2023-2024 if they don't change the program.
* Any other suggestions for best way to use points to do this trip?  All three passengers are adults and I've got us all currently using the Delta AMEX to build points.

Destination | Route | Carrier | Stay Length
---|---|---|---
Tokyo | LAX - HND | ANA | 11 days
Bangkok | NRT - BKK | ANA | 3 days
Singapore | BKK - SIN | Singapore Air | 3 days
Ho Chi Minh City | SIN - SGN | Singapore Air | 3 days

Amsterdam | ZRH - AMS | Swiss International Airlines | 4 days
Lisbon | AMS - MUC - LIS | Lufthansa | 3 days
New York | LIS - EWR | TAP Portugal | Return...ish

The distance was 22,316 miles (darn, just over 22,000...) costing 145,000 ANA miles in business and around $800 in fees.

* I only used ANA's award search since it sounds like most other searches aren't that useful anymore. It isn't too bad once you get the hang of it, unless there's only economy seats and few/no business (in which case you have to check every date combination)
* The hardest parts of this redemption are definitely when crossing continents. 
   * Finding availability from LAX - TYO was like pulling teeth, you really just have to get lucky. 
  * Same with SE Asia to Europe, but for a different reason - there are hardly any routes, which meant I had to do this terrible workaround to Zurich if I wanted to fly in business the whole time (SIN - ZRH was available I think, but in economy). 
  * Europe to the west coast was also impossible for the same reason, hence the trip to NY. Even finding a trip back from NY (or anywhere in North America after coming from Europe) to the west coast was difficult.
* I'd suggest is figuring out the cross-continental routes that actually exist and work for you, then working out everything in between.
* I tried my best to avoid airlines with high fuel surcharges like Lufthansa, but unfortunately it wasn't possible between AMS-LIS. Definitely check which airlines have high fuel surcharges when deciding on routes.
* The SGN - TPE - VIE - ZRH is almost 24 hours of pure transit, but it only counts as one stopover (but multiple segments).
* Took 48 hours for MR to transfer to my ANA account.

I'm near BOS and it seems like my best option for a non-stop flight (my preference) would be to go to JFK. I was planning on taking Amtrak/MTA to get to JFK (via AirTrain I think). Afterwards, the plan is to stay a few days in GRU at the beginning of my trip (so, just 2-3 days), and then head to CNF for a wedding, spend a few days in CNF, and then fly back to GRU and JFK when I'm all done.

I checked AwardHacker, and it seems like I could potentially use my AsiaMiles (oneworld partner) to get the non-stop AA flight out of JFK (round trip)? for a cool 44k points. If I am reading the award charts correctly, that would be wicked sick, but, I believe the flight might actually be operated by Gol (according to Google Flights)... So can I really use my miles from the AsiaMiles program? Similarly, it looks like I can use 15k miles to do the GRU/CNF round trip with AA, is that really possible to do too? I have no clue about the flights internal in Brazil (about how I would even book those).

Another question I have is, usually I would book all of the flights (so, JFK -&gt; GRU -&gt; CNF -&gt; GRU -&gt; JFK) at once. If I book them separately, I just need to be very generous with time constraints, right? Since it's not all one ticket/flight plan. So if my plane out of GRU to JFK leaves at like 9:30pm, then I should make sure to arrive at like 5pm from CNF back at GRU (mostly guessing here).

Finally, any recommendations for airlines to fly while in Brazil? Last time I was there, I was like 7, so I have no clue what good airlines exist.

I have never booked a miles-based flight, so any general advice there would be helpful too. Answers to any of my questions (including to read more/links for me to read more) are greatly appreciated.

I just booked a round trip from EWR-YQB on United. Would have cost $2219 in economy for 2 people. Instead, saver availability opened up, and I booked it for 24,000 Aeroplan miles + $247 in taxes and fees. So that's 8.2 cpp for economy on a pretty short hop (&lt;2 hrs one way).

I was wondering if anyone has done this before. The reason I'm asking is because it seems rather common as an award booking on ANA with Eva but I think it error's out and was looking for potential ways around it. I've called in to ask about this and they confirm they cannot issue the ticket. Have there been any success stories?

I'm seeing some availability in July/Aug of next year on ANA to fly Eva J SFO - ICN, which connects in Taipei. It'll let you proceed with the booking online and even get to the payments page. However, it won't issue your ticket afterwards because it violates rule 4 of the below. (SFO - TPE is farther away than SFO - ICN direct).

I decided to book a one-way BA flight from IAD to LHR in business class (Club World Suites). It's like 50k Avios I think, but the taxes and fees were astronomical (like $880 iirc). So, I decided to book through Asia Miles (Cathay Pacific).

The same flight is 61,000 Asia Miles, but I got lucky and Amex started a 20% transfer bonus for August, so I only used 51,000 points. Taxes and fees came out to $240, and this flight tends to average like $2,800 one way. I am just buying an economy cash flight home because the taxes and fees out of the UK are so high, I would rather just buy a cheap ticket and save my points for another time.

I called Cathay Pacific and they were super easy to get on the phone and very helpful. Since Amex says it can take 48 hours for points to transfer, I had them reserve the flight for me for 72 hours. Then I transferred the points (which of course did transfer instantly, but always better safe than sorry). Called back and they confirmed the booking and sent me a payment link for the taxes and fees.

Overall, it was a super easy process and (in my opinion) a great redemption of points for the value. If anyone has any questions about this feel free to ask!

Short version:  Three weeks ago, I made a reservation on AA BOS-IND in April booked through Iberia using Avios.  The Iberia site, doesn't show the reservation in the My Trips section when I log in, but if I search for the reservation by PNR, it finds it.  When drilling down into the reservation, it shows a ticket number for each passenger, but no seat assignments.

The Iberia site wouldn't let me book the complete trip under one PNR/Reservation, so I booked the last leg separately.  The first time I booked it, it appeared to go through, but then 72 hours later they cancelled it with no explanation and refunded my Avios.  Re-booking it the next day, it sat in limbo for 48 hours, but eventually a ticket number was assigned to it.

Wife and I have our honeymoon to Italy in October and our flight was just cancelled for a 2nd time (just the flight back).

The best replacement flight they could offer us was slightly longer travel time, 2 stops instead of 1, and arrived home after midnight instead of 8pm.  Obviously a worse flight.

Spoke with a rep and then escalated to a supervisor who said they could NOT:

1. Open up another more comparable flight for award ticket. It shows cash tickets available.  Could be because 1 of the 3 legs is by Dolomiti Airlines and not United?

2. Give a complimentary upgrade to premium economy on the replacement flight offered.

3. Give us a partial point refund on the replacement flight offered.

May 14 to June 9-10 out of LAX. Ideal destinations mostly involve a flight to Europe - We'd like to hit a few of the following: Iceland, Morocco, Portugal, Croatia, Tunisia, and possibly Kenya. If Asia is an option, we're also interested in Japan, Korea, Vietnam &amp; Cambodia. As you can see, we're flexible.

I currently have 140k Amex, 95k citi thankyou, 135k Cap One, 50k Chase, and 180K Delta. We're going to be getting another 75-100 Cap One points in 3-4 months as well. I have Amex Plat, Amex Delta Gold, Citi Premier, CapOne X, and we both have Chase Preferred. I'm looking at the lower level CapOne card with a 75K bonus to boost our points.

It looks like Aeroplan or LifeMiles might be best to consolidate the Amex, Citi, and CapOne points but I'm having a hard time finding flights on those. Delta One flights are ridiculously expensive (although I DID find a few to N Africa for 100-120k).

Planned a honeymoon to spain next year but turns out when you get married, the urge to do something NOW is strong. So we booked a last minute (within 2-weeks) weekend here for 2 nights, and stayed at the property about 2 weeks ago. Spent 180K for the privilege in the spa suite, which absolutely was not worth that huge cost in points - but hey, that's what you get for doing things last minute. I wish we could have booked for this past weekend which had a standard room available for only 90k points total - but we had prior obligations. The spa suite was definitely the ""worst"" suite on the property judging by pictures. It felt pretty dated inside, the mid-2000's era hot tub we barely used, and the view was over a parking lot. Also, our air conditioner in our room essentially did not work at all, and on the first night it was uncomfortably warm in the room. Thankfully someone delivered a fan and the night time air was cool enough to be comfortable with all the windows open. Being in the woods has its benefits here. But you absolutely do not expect to run at that kind of issue at a place like this.

Overall, a really great time but with some caveats. So much of our time here was really soured due to lots of little service mishaps. However… there really is nothing quite like the complete package on offer here. And the things it gets right it gets REALLY right.

If there’s one thing you should want to book this place for, its to indulge in pure gastronomic hedonism for a few days. All inclusive food (not drinks) adds an interesting spin on things in that you really want to explore the entire menu, order room service, get that poolside lemon bar, whatever - all guilt free (on the wallet at least). This is nothing new for those used to all inclusives but this place is special because *everything* is done at the level of a high end Californian restaurant. The meals we had during our stay would have easily cost $125-$150 for two (without drinks) at any other restaurant in the region and we would have been happy with that price - and that's NOT including the amazing view which usually has a “price tax” of its own. Everything we ate was fantastic, and we tried almost the entire menu. The cocktails were excellent too. (tip - show up before 5:30-6pm on dinner to get the best view under some shade. Also means the free cocktail hour + charcuterie at 4pm acts as a really nice ""appetizer"" course for the dinner).

But again - it's the fact that it's all inclusive that really makes this shine. Nobody’s really gonna decide to eat at a fancy restaurant for two days in a row. But you can here - and not only that, you can go there for breakfast and lunch too! And if you want, the ENTIRE menu can be room serviced if you’re ordering at the correct times (yes even the dinner menu - which wasn't the case before judging by previous reports). Nothing like having amazing french toast, a pastry basket, a morning cocktail and a full breakfast showing up to your door before you get out of bed.

Then you have the property itself, which is very well thought out. Quiet and intimate. The limited number of rooms, no kids, and never having walk through hallways/atriums and instead walking through beautiful meandering woods everywhere really helped reinforce the feeling that everything there was for you. You’re not ever going to run into a crowd here and there will always be room to lounge somewhere with a gorgeous, quiet view.

However, service is where things really slipped up - which you don’t expect at a flagship property like this. I frequently got the sense that feedback/requests were listened to and then simply ignored. A few examples:

- Food orders got messed up almost every time we ordered food in one way or another. For lunch one day, received a chicken sandwich instead of a burger. Breakfast the following morning, was missing an entire entree. Dinner that evening, we requested dessert to go since we were stuffed but never received cutlery or the side of ice cream we requested with it.
- You’re supposed to receive a text on check in day when your room is ready. We never did - our keys were ready well in advance and it wasn’t until we walked up to the front desk past check in time that someone got them off the shelf for us. This meant we missed out on cocktail hour as we settled into our room.
- Housekeeping was a constant issue. One morning we were leaving our room right as housekeeping showed up. No big deal - we just told them we’d be out in a minute. One minute later, housekeeping was gone and they never ended up showing up at all that day. We had to go back to the front desk and tell them to do housekeeping while we hung out by the pool. Another night turndown service never showed up while we were out for dinner. I left feedback at the front desk and never felt like it was actually listened to.
- This is a minor thing, but we were quite full after dinner one night and requested a cart come pick us up to take us to the room. Was told by the server that one was waiting outside for us. Except there wasn’t one outside and right as we were about to head inside to as for another one, one showed up to pick up a different couple before driving away

As bad as our service experience was, I will say everyone did seem like they were genuinely trying to be helpful and were genuinely apologetic. To me, it seemed more like there were labor issues with non-guest-facing roles or perhaps everyone was stretched to thin to actually execute good service. While I’m empathetic, I’ve been in hyatt hotels that cost 3X less than this place that had outstanding, attention-to-detail service (complete with a welcome gift on check in which this place did not do)... so it was very surprising to come here and experience service worse than your average hotel.

Would I recommend this place? Absolutely. There really is nothing quite like it so it’s hard to not recommended it for that. When it goes right, it's really special. But I would absolutely not spend more than 30-45K for a room here. You probably won't want to use your suite to its full potential. And then, the rooms aren’t “WOW” enough to justify the huge extra cost over the standard room. Perhaps they're a bit of a better deal if you come in winter and might not want to be at the pool much?Also, I agree with other people here. Needing to text the front desk for food service and other general requests is not nearly as nice as the ""ipad"" I saw in videos.

Sorry if this is over asked.  
I have tried google without great success.  


I am in Ontario and use an RBC **Avion Visa Infinite** to earn Avion points.  
If i try and book a business class seat, for example Toronto to London, UK for some time next year, the prices are just not too different than simply booking for cash on the BA Website.  


RBC rewards Business Class return 65,000 points and $4,426 CDN  
BA Website Business Class return $5,709 CDN for the same flights.  
I had hoped using my points would gain me more of a discount.

  
If  i price a similar trip using BA Avios points, it's 100,000 Avios but only $1702 CDN

For example, let's say I want to fly from Washington Dulles to Honolulu using Turkish miles for 15k points round trip. I was able to randomly find on Turkish website a couple dates in the past that had seats available, but have not had any luck lately. I read that the United website is the best tool to search Star Alliance seats. In this case, it is correct that I should search United website for flights that say ""Saver Award"" as only those will be available to book through Turkish? It seems to be harder now than before when they had a calendar view showing saver seats availability. 

Some ""experts"" recommend searching on every single airline partner that my points can transfer to. I don't mind doing this, but may I ask if this means it's no longer necessary to look for the ""saver award"" tag as now I'm just comparing which airline charges the lowest number of points?

awardtravel,"Hey guys,

So I opened the Marriott Boundless card last month with the hope that I could possibly use 4 of the 5 FNC SUB for an upcoming trip to NYC during Labor Day Weekend (Aug 30 - Sept 4).  I knew the odds of using the 5 FNC was slim given how soon the dates were so I booked a 4 night stay at the Hyatt Place New York/Midtown- South as a backup with cash (I'm interested in establishing Hyatt loyalty over the next few years). The total cost for that came out to about $1100 (prices were a lot more expensive than I expected). Well a month later, I managed to hit the MB SUB in one month and have finally got the 5 FNC posted to my account. I see that I have an opportunity to use 4 FNC for my Labor Day trip on the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel but I'm not sure if it's worth doing this now given the property doesn't seem to be as great as the Hyatt. My question is if you were in my shoes would you choose to stick with the Hyatt cash booking or burn 4 FNC for the Sheraton?

Until recently, each of these showed wide open standard night availability until the end of May 2023, but the schedule hadn't opened in June+ yet. Checking the other day, I saw that the schedule finally opened for June/July at all hotels, but every single day is a Premium award which was hugely disappointing. Worse still, it seems like Northolme and Labriz both retroactively changed all standard availability to premium as far back as January 2023 and Mango House did the same through April 2023. 

I would be shocked if somehow all standard room availability was snatched up simultaneously over all nights for months, so I have to image this is either: 

- the hotels making a policy change to eliminate standard availability, although changing this for all of 2023 seems excessive

- a glitch in the system when June/July availability was opened up that someone never released standard rooms and also affected previous months

**Los Cabos:** JW Marriott Los Cabos Beach Resort and Spa (320,000 points). From what I could find, there is an all inclusive griffin package that ranges from 200-250/night (not sure if per person or per room). Otherwise food or drink could get pricey.

**Grenada**: Laluna, Grenada, a member of Design Hotels (270,000 points). Cheap point redemption, can upgrade to cottage 1 king, sea view.

**Punta Cana, DR:**

\- The Westin Puntacana Resort &amp; Club (210,000 points). Premium guest room, 1 king ocean view with balcony.

\-Royalton Puntacana, an autograph collection all inclusive (252,000 points). Luxury guest room, 1 king with garden view.

\-Hideaway royalton puntacana all inclusive (262,000 points). Luxury guest room, garden view

**Key West, FL:** As much as i want to venture into carribean, key west can be a good backup

awardtravel,"Hey award travel friends! I'm trying to use an upcoming round trip from London to Philadelphia (Dec 1 to Dec 4) to learn some more about international award travel since I primarily use it for short haul flights. I'm interested in a premium economy or above ticket, and want to find _efficient_ uses of points to score premium economy or above for better than 1.25cpp via the Chase portal.

I'm eyeing the 6:35AM American flight out of LHR that lands in Philadelphia at 1:30PM, and the departing 6:50PM flight that gets in at LHR at 6:50AM. 

* For cash, via BA I can book this with economy for 584 GBP or premium economy for 935GBP. 
* Looking at the Avios redemptions pages for the same flights, economy round trip is 43K Avios + $490 (at GBP = 1.22 USD, using points mean I'm spending 43K Avios to save $222. Boo.) 
* Unfortunately the Avios redemption page has no more premium economy flights on the outbound, and won't show me the Avios price for premium economy on the inbound.

I've pieced together ideas from reading around a lot, but before I make actual bookings I'm interested in any advice.

1) I know by flying round trip from inside the UK to anywhere outside, Avios redemptions often get screwed via fuel surcharges and APD. I see some of the itineraries between London and Philadelphia involve a layover in Dublin. 

* Are the charges associated with point redemptions diminished when there's a layover in another country?
* How bad of an idea is it to book a round trip cash itinerary from London to Dublin, and try to pair it with a separate point itinerary from Dublin to America? I don't know what the customs or baggage headaches will be (I'm a US citizen fwiw). It also looks like some DUB&lt;-&gt;PHL flights also go BACK to London. I assume I can't just walk out of the airport in the middle of one of those itineraries too?

2) I've read that using points to upgrade from one cabin to the next tier is a more efficient use of points.

* Is there less of a penalty regarding fuel surcharges/fees when upgrading a cash fare versus booking outright with points?
* Is there any way to see what the upgrade cost would be to upgrade from 'economy to premium economy'/'premium economy to business' before I book the initial cash fare?
* I noted how there was no premium economy reward seats for that outbound flight. Are the premium economy seats that are reserved for cash tickets available to passengers that are upgrading an economy seat?

3) If anyone can spy a sick point deal for premium economy or above on these dates I'd be interested in that plus whatever resource you used to quickly find it!

awardtravel,"A while back, before becoming interested in this subreddit and maxing my rewards in general, I booked a redemption stay at The Dixon in London for 98k points and a FNC. But looking at the monetary point value I’m getting, it’s very low (about 5c per point).  

I can redeem for 210k points at the JW Marriott, Grosvenor House, which is a better value (9c per point) but I won’t be able to use the FNC for that hotel and I don’t have any upcoming redemptions in mind for that. 

So, I’m asking, in my position, what would you do?

Other relevant info:

* JW is closer to central London and within walking distance of several things we have planned. 
* This will be our first time in London so we are looking to be close to the action. Both of these hotels seem to fit that bill, just in different ways. 
* We don’t have holiday travel planned yet so FNC shouldn’t be too difficult to use by the end of the year—we just don’t have anything specific in mind yet, which stresses me out slightly.

I checked Qantas, it's 81K but it will not mention the taxes/fees. Unless I have the points to see it. 

Particularly,

DCA -&gt; MIA -&gt; UVF (6AM to 2:59PM)

UVF -&gt; MIA -&gt; DCA (4:24PM to 11:56PM)

According to AA this flight is 1,600$.

If I go through with Iberia, I'd be getting about 2cpp on redemption. Otherwise, if I can use AA pts somehow, I'm getting 3.6cpp which is really good.

Appreciate any recommendations/suggestions.

Edit: For anyone interested. I didn't know you could transfer your points from BA to Iberia via Avios. I ended up transferring 62K UR to BA with the 30% bonus and transferring those Avios points to Iberia. It's not as good as the 45K from AA but I am happy with redeeming the points for 2.7cpp.",What would be the best way to spend points for DCA/IAD -&gt; UVF?,,s0uly,,3,7/27/2022 20:00

awardtravel,"Hi everyone,

I'll be traveling at least a few nights per month for this year (mostly US/Canada around 25 nights) and would like to enroll in a hotel rewards program that will give me some good perks and help me accumulate rewards toward future stays (I plan to get married end of the year, so maybe a an inclusive resort stay next year)

I think in an average year I do around 20-30 nights.

I already have the Chase Preferred, Freedom Unlimited and Amex Cash Magnet so don't wish to get new credit cards, I'll also be shifting to Canada (BC) later this year. 

This is what I currently have/can get:

- **Hilton Silver** (~17k points) 

Accumulated these points when I was on a friend's family plan. I used to get 50% off most Hilton properties and it was nice, don't have it anymore as unfortunately they were laid off for a brief while during covid. Current corporate offer is stay 4 nights to earn Gold and 8 nights to earn Diamond within 90 days. So basically I can earn Diamond easily but will have to do 42+ nights per year to maintain it, which would be difficult.

- **Sonesta Elite** valid through December 31, 2023

Got Elite as a corporate benefit, I need 12+ nights/year to maintain. I would it's pretty easy but my concern is that chain footprint is not great especially considering that I will be staying most nights in Canada.

- **Hyatt Explorist** 

Got Explorist as a corporate benefit, have to stay 10+ nights in a 90-day trial period that begins when I check out for the first time. Explorist status will remain valid through February 29, 2024 after that. If I stay 20+ nights in 90 days I will earn Globalist status through February 29, 2024. I will need to do 30 nights a year to maintain Explorist which is doable if I always stay in Hyatt. Another benefit is the Chase UR points transfer. 

- **Marriott Platinum Elite**  

I am not a member but have this offer: Stay for 15 paid nights from 7/27/2022 through 10/31/2022 and Enjoy Platinum Elite status and benefits for up to one year. I can probably do 15 paid nights by 10/31 but doing 50 nights per year to maintain would be difficult.

- **IHG Platinum** 

I am not a member but have this offer: Stay for 5 nights in next 120 days to maintain IHG Platinum till keep December 2023, if I can stay 15 nights in the next 120 days, they will upgrade me to Diamond till December 2023. 40 nights/year an afterwards to maintain.


Dumb question #1: When these hotels offers  say stay X nights, do I have book through them or can I aslo book Chase Portal, etc?


Dumb question #2: Is there any benefit in having multiple hotel reward programs?


**Current Offers I can use:**

I just booked a DFW &gt; MAD nonstop J and am having doubts. It was 80k + $243 (total for 2 people) for P1 and P2. I am extremely flexible starting April 2023 all the way to December 2023 and would like to pretty much check out Europe and beyond if possible.

It was 95k Virgin Miles (total for 2 people) and \~ $650 in tax and fees (for 2 people) for P1 and P2 (flight is on AF).

Are these good redemption rates? I have a decent balance of points but this took me YEARS to build up. I am starting to churn more so hopefully will increase our balances. We have never ever taken a 1st class product before so it is shocking how much these flights cost with the opportunity cost of the points + the tax/surcharges. We have been doing Scott's Deals cash flights on sale in economy for the past 3 years and have been spoiled with cash price.

I am thinking about cancelling the DFW &gt; MAD flight to do some more reading instead of getting FOMO and booking that flight.

TL;DR: Our first 3 nights were in a part of the resort that looked like it could collapse at any moment. Water started leaking in our room on day 3 and we very calmly asked for an upgrade (we are both Gold) and it all worked out, with a much nicer area of the hotel. Rest of the vacation was fine, but still thought maybe we could be reimbursed for the first 3 nights. 70k was the cost per night, but the first 3 nights I used my husband's 2 certs so his grand total was 70k. The rest of the nights were under my account, which is also when we were upgraded to a different/better part of the resort. 

Currently: All communication I've had with Hilton has only been about the first 3 nights when we stayed in the leaking room. They offered my husband 70k total. When he (re: me) asked 'what about the certs I used for 2 of the nights?"" They said, sorry, we can only offer you 70k. 

QUESTION: Would you continue to press on this? It hasn't been annoying yet. Just emailing back and forth, so it's no time wasted. But I do feel like I'm at a dead end and not sure what I would say to sway them. I did give them a plan b: if they couldn't reimburse the certs then I'd take points instead. They didn't budge.

The ANA PDF of my reservation lists a baggage allowance for LOT but not for Turkish. I have heard from here horror stories of people with United awards on Turkish not having checked bag allowances. I called Turkish today and gave her the booking reference and the agent said I have a 3 checked bag allowance up to 96 kg. But Turkish customer service is so undependable. Does anybody know whether this no Turkish checked baggage allowance is limited to United awards or whether it happens with other star alliance partners?

This impacts whether I check a bag or whether I try to get by with just a carry on. I think Turkish charges something like $200 for a checked bag transatlantic if you don’t have an allowance. 

I have a separate ANA award in September outbound on AC and returning on TAP Portugal and that award lists a checked bag allowance for AC but not TAP. I’ve never heard of TAP not giving J passengers a checked bag allowance so that gives me some solace that maybe it’s just a weird thing with ANA.

We land in terminal 2E, hall K and our next flight leaves from (I think) terminal 2D...our ticket says 2A but I don't think that's right based on tracking the same flight on other days. It is an Air France codeshare to a non-Schengen European country.

And if not, is it possible to go to 2F on the way to 2D? It looks like they are adjacent in the same building but 2F is for Schengen flights. Would we have to clear customs and clear security to get to the 2F lounge, and then go through customs and security again to get to 2D? We might be down to do it even so, but would they even let us into 2F if our ticket doesn't leave from that terminal?

I've been researching and searching past 48 hours (various airlines, and points.me, and this https://awards.pnr.sh/ site I found in this sub tonight has really been a game changer).

My takeaway is that there is practically no F or J award space for those dates. But, it seems that there is a lot more award spots released closer to the departure date. For example, right now there are plenty of F on various LH flights from US -&gt; FRA over the next couple of weeks. Although what I see on awards.pnr.sh does not always show up on aeroplan search.

So my plan for now is to just keep an eye out on my alerts and look to book departure closer to the date. Then hopefully find my LH F departure, transfer points to Aeroplan and book through there. Does that sound like the best bet here?

For the return, I'm more unsure how to handle that. Not really any direct flights or award bookings I can find in general back from KRK. Should I just focus on finding an atlantic award flight from FRA or another hub and position from KRK to FRA?

* Asia to Europe flights were pretty much non-existent outside of BKK-FRA or BKK-MUC. Outside of connections in Delhi with LOT or Jedda with Turkish, I was pretty much just limited to Thai to get me all the way to Europe.
* Saw quite a bit of availability from Vienna and Zurich to JFK and IAD. Saw some Turkish availability to MIA too. No availability from Europe to the West Coast. The Air Canada flight from YUL through YYZ to LAX was one of only 2 ways I could find to get anywhere on the west coast.
* Was expecting higher fees but I am not going to ask any questions there.
* Took exactly 36 hours to transfer from Amex to ANA.
* Not exactly the airlines I wanted but with such short notice I can't get picky.
* In Bangkok I'll be staying at the Waldorf Astoria. In Chiang Mai I'll be at the Shangri-La. But in Phuket I have no hotel yet. Any recommendations you all might have for any Phuket resorts would be greatly appreciated (budget is no issue). I am doing all my hotel reservations on the Amex portal to take advantage of the 5x points with the plat to get back some of the points spent on the flight.
* I transferred the points Thursday night and started looking on Saturday morning when the points were there. Took about 3 hours to figure out the flights and I was on the phone about an hour (long wait).

awardtravel,"I'm planning a trip from Denver to Athens to enjoy a honeymoon in Santorini and I'm sorta booking last minute (fiancé is pissed) hoping you guys could save me a bit here. 

I have 400k MR points which I've been stock piling for awhile, so I have never actually redeemed any before. Please excuse my inexperience. 

The dates I  had in mind are 10/27 - 11/3 ( I am a bit flexible on these dates realistically anything from date span 10/25 - 11/6 would work. I would like to spend 5-7 nights in Greece)

I've searched flights from Denver to Athens and I didn't have any luck finding deals. After some research it appears DIA is not a very great hub for award travel to my particular destination, but  found that Chicago seems to be a good hub for UA flights to Athens. 

I ended up locating a round trip from ORD - ATH  77k Business class there, and 30k economy back  10/27 - 11/3. Which would put the total at 214k UA Miles. Add a flight from DIA - ORD $159 cash.  I don't mind paying out of pocket for the flight to Chicago.  It still seems a bit expensive though. Any other suggestion out there? 

I would prefer business class both ways, but I couldn't justify the 155k returning flights.

Side question - lets say I want to book this particular flight. Which partner would I transfer the MR to for this united flight? 

Any suggestions for MR redemption on hotels if I have any left over...  would also be appreciated :)

awardtravel,"Hi people! New here, hope I'm not breaking the rules.

Everything I've read about churning talks about fabulous trips to far-off exotic locations, and the massive discounts you can get for these high-priced airline tickets. 

But what if you just want to go to one smallish location, and it's not super expensive, it's just kind of a pain?

I'm living in VA, originally from Saskatchewan, Canada. I could fly out of IAD (Washington DC) or RIC (Richmond VA), and fly into GTF (Great Falls MT) or YYC (Calgary).  It just depends on the exact dates which places are cheapest. 

Similarly, I can either fly AA/AirCanada or Delta/Westjet, although I've found that AA is often delayed. And since I always have at least one layover (if I'm lucky) this is an issue. 

One time I opened an Amex Delta Gold card and used the 40k bonus points for a trip home. But they seem to incentivize certain routes. For instance, that trip I flew out from YQR (Regina, SK) because it was several hundred points cheaper. For anyone keeping track at home, any airport is a 3-5 hour drive, so it really doesn't matter which way I go. 

Given the situation, do you think it's worth me chasing travel points or should I just focus on cashback rewards and pay for trips home with that? Or is there a particular points system which is flexible?

In case it's relevant, I don't do any other travel, but I do have a business and put at least 50k on various business cc. I think I have 120k Chase Ultimate rewards points on business ccs but it looks like my only options to spend them are cashback and buying giftcards.

awardtravel,"Hi all! First, I'd just like to say how excited I am to have found this community. I've been fortunate enough to work at a company that does a lot of digital marketing, so we put a lot of ad dollars (mostly clients, not ours) on our cards. As a result, I have saved up a lot of points at Amex, Chase, and Capital One. Over the last 10 years, I've used them for probably over 100 flights for me and my family. All the deals I've found and tricks I've learned have been my own though since I didn't really know of anybody who did this. I'm looking forward to sharing what I've learned and learning from you guys!

From what I'm reading, one of my shortcomings has definitely been overlooking hotel deals. For me, the happiest I get from redeeming points is when I get good value. I guess I would define value as the percentage of savings at $1 per 100 points over the retail price you'd otherwise pay to get the deal. For example, two of my favorite ones are the Lifemiles redemption for Lufthansa first class (I flew that for \~90,000 several times, but it's been harder to find in the last few years) and the 45,000 business class redemption on Turkish Airlines from NA to anywhere in Europe via Istanbul. Those are the best deals I've been able to book. The Singapore/Emirates suites have been on my list, but I haven't been able to grab those yet.

I basically have four questions for you guys.

1. First, what other great values have you found out there for flights?
2. Do high-value hotel deals exist? I've always figured they were more like economy flights where you basically got close to 1:1 on your points. Do hotels work like dynamic pricing (a $300 room is 30,000 points), or can there be something like the zones that airline programs have where you can get a room that is typically $1,000 for 30,000 points?
3. Do hotels/resorts ever have large homes available through points? Our company regularly does company retreats and we always book through vrbo or airbnb, but if we could get something for everyone with points, that would be amazing.
4. Are there ever non-flight, non-hotel redemptions that are worth considering? I look every once in a while and never see anything that interesting. I'm curious what you guys have redeemed for in the past that you found interesting.",Best Value When Redeeming Points?,,slightlynocturnal,,10,7/24/2022 12:51

ANA RTW: 125k MR + $687 pp

HAM-&gt;LIS flight: $150 pp

KBV-&gt;KUL flight: $36 pp

HKT-&gt;KBV ferry: $20 pp

**Thoughts:**

* I used FlightConnections to find routes. I used a mix of United, ANA, and Aeroplan to search. United is best for finding open dates for non-competitive flights. I used ANA and Aeroplan to confirm and to search for competitive flights. By the time flights can be seen on United, it's too late.
* By far the hardest flight to get was SFO-&gt;NRT in NH J, followed by LIS-&gt;SFO in TP J, then Asia-&gt;IST in J, then the rest.
* I booked the SFO-&gt;NRT route 343 days in advance. At that time I booked a short RTW with incorrect dates besides this first leg. Then I called back at a later date to rebook with the correct dates. I ended up having to cancel and then immediately rebook because I wanted to change the routing. The ANA rep checked the waitlist for my SFO-&gt;NRT flight and there was no one on it so she thought it would be safe to cancel and immediately rebook. It worked. I had a backup if it didn't (SFO-&gt;TPE in BR J). But something didn't work...
* It costs 3k ANA miles ***PER PERSON*** to cancel a RTW trip. I had preemptively transferred 3k MR to my account for the cancel and rebook but now I was 3k short. The ANA rep initially told me she was unable to hold my booking and the trip would need to be canceled. After shitting myself, I escalated and eventually a manager approved holding my trip until I transferred the points in. Took around 60 (long) hours. Trip was ticketed.
* If Japan is not open to tourists in April of 2023, I will call to turn my stopover in NRT into a connection on to HAN. The schedules line up.
* Interestingly, we're ticketed for SQ J on HAN-&gt;SIN-&gt;HKT. Hopefully it sticks!
* Getting from SE Asia to IST non-stop in J was frustrating. For whatever reason, a lot of flights were not available or just not bookable with points. I wanted HKT-&gt;IST in TK J, but I'm happy w the KUL-&gt;IST in TK J leg. Other routes I considered in TK J were: SGN-&gt;IST, BKK-&gt;IST, SIN-&gt;IST. I also considered BKK-&gt;VIE or AMS in BR J, but I wanted to go to Istanbul. I would be interested to see how others have routed from Asia-&gt;Europe in non-stop J w Star Alliance.
* The HAM-&gt;LIS leg in TP J was initially included in the 125k RTW, but when I went back to rebook I was quoted at 145k. So YMMV on the mileage calculation. I ended up dropping it and paying cash. Worked out better because the fuel surcharges for the flight ended up being more than the cash price of the flight itself.
* I've taken the LIS-&gt;SFO in TP J route before. It's a great option, even though it adds some YQ. An alternative route with low YQ that I considered was WAW-&gt;LAX. Lmk how you like to get back to the West Coast from Europe in non-stop J w Star Alliance.

|Lisbon|Airbnb|$90|5|$453|

**Thoughts:**

* Most places we are visiting are extremely cheap $-wise so I mostly went w high value hotels and bnbs. I used google, [booking.com](https://booking.com/), expedia, and airbnb to find cheap lodging. This is not my area of expertise so if anyone has a better method I'd love to hear it.
* Tokyo is expensive and the HR Tokyo seems like a good deal in a great location.
* All my bookings are cancelable and fully-refundable in case anything happens to the trip.
* We are subletting our bay area apartment while we are gone for 2 months and should almost certainly make more than the cost of our lodging while traveling.

Yes, I know little nugget will be a ""bundle of joy"" but I really wanted this super luxury experience.  I've tried rebooking the same/similar itinerary but the points needed to book trip on short notice are astronomical.

So now I'm sitting on a bundle of points (500K MR, 250K UR, 300K Marriott, probably 150K Hilton, 140K Ethiad) &amp; trying to decide what to do next.

In trying to book a reward flight and getting tired of waiting for airline pages with rewards space to load, I stumbled onto [this thread](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/travel-tools/1296363-award-booking-services-list-some-reviews.html) from flyertalk which lists different award booking services that are out there. The idea is pretty much the same:

* you provide itinerary
* they research availability
* they present alternative options
* you settle on one and pay
* optionally they book for you

So I filtered through broken links and defunct pages on that forum post and reached out to a few of the providers. Now the interesting part is that I got some very different prices for the research portion for the same itinerary, ranging from $0 to $150.

No questions about the business model, but I am curious if there is a difference in the data that they have access to for rewards space. In other words, if the $0 research produced no results for my itinerary, can I assume that the $150 research will \[generally\] use the same system, such as ExpertFlyer, and thus the results will be the same?",Award booking services – what can they access/see?,,leeeshka,,12,7/21/2022 14:37

UPDATE: I ran a bunch of award searches from my home airport (YVR) to get a sense of what the lowest business class award pricing is now on Air France:

* UK and Switzerland: 80k
* Schengen Area and most eastern European EU: 65k
* Non EU parts of Europe (such as Belgrade): 55k
* Middle east: 95k *Israel now Middle East*
* Africa: 95k
* Asia: 105k+

i read a bunch of blog posts that seem to imply this process should be fairly straightforward, but some people say i need to call in. does anyone have any experience being successful calling into air canada or krisflyer for this kind of request? how can i tell if these united flights are actually redeemable on partner airlines?

any advice is very much appreciated!",book united with partner airline,,lazyprogrammer7,,6,7/20/2022 15:14
awardtravel,"Working my way through cards, contemplating any strategy for Marriott.  

I have methods for IHG, Choice, Wyndham, and Hilton.

With Amex, I'll only have one credit card slot open.  Currently have two BBPs, Hilton Biz, and plan on an Aspire.

I was thinking about a Bonvoy Brilliant, as I feel a 50k cert is much more useable than a 35k.  I'm not ruling out a Bonvoy biz totally yet.

The wife doesn't have any Amex cards currently, and is 4/24.

They have the 5 free night offer that I believe is ending soon as well.  I was thinking maybe she could get this, then in a year upgrade to a Ritz.  Which would give us a couple of 50k certs a year... although they come with fees and the headaches of using credits up.

Anyways, I keep thinking... after those nights are gone, or when we have those annual certs and need points to top off...

I can't seem to think of a good way to generate points other than SUBs.  

Biz spend seems like a terrible value, transfers from MR and UR not so hot as well.

I'm almost thinking just buy Marriott gift cards for 20% off through  daily getaways or other CC offers, might be the way to go, and just earn points through status on stays.

The other options are just to milk the SUBs, downgrade or cancel later on.

Essentially I (solo) want to travel from London to Chicago after this coming Saturday (July 23) on a saver fare, preferably OneWorld or Star Alliance as I'm pretty low on UR, MR, and TYP at the moment.

The issue I am seeing is heavily reduced inventory to anywhere out of London, due to issues with staff shortages, the weather, strike action from fuel workers, and a hard cap on the number of daily passengers allowed to travel. This is combined with insane prices for cash fares to anywhere in Europe or the US.

I have tried nearly every United route I can think of out of Europe, with the only potentially feasible trips being Lisbon -&gt; Toronto -&gt; Chicago on Monday, or Copenhagen to Chicago direct, however getting myself to those destinations would probably cost $500+, which I would prefer to avoid if possible.

* Time slot, 2023 - May 29th to June 15, roughly 10 day trip in between those dates.
* Willing to reposition (home base - AUS) to any NE city for better/shorter flights.

**Points:**

|UR|174,005|28,131|
|MR|261,036|83,873|
|Cap1|157,791|121,821|
|DL|145112||
|B6|112,000||
|AA|67,989||

**Researched**:

1. Best I've come up with is MR -&gt; ANA, United flight non stop IAD -&gt;FCO / FCO -&gt; IAD. 222,000 pts + $241.88.
2. Wanted to use up my DL miles. Was able to price out 4 tix from BOS - FCO / FCO-BOS via AF (stop over in CDG) at 70k + $8X.XX. They charged $30 a seat to pick for each segment which got the fees to $6XX. Never transferred the needed balance of DL miles from MR, which was great because now those flights are showing low 100k. Missed the boat on that one.
3. TAP, BOS - LIS - FCO and back, fees were too high.
4. Did sign up for a 24hr pass with [points.me](https://points.me), but didn't see anything from ANA listed and really don't want to use up UR for the United metal/partner route.

**Preferences**:

1. Keep taxes low (2 public school teachers over here)
2. Fly from a N.E. city to keep it shorter. Prefer PHL as parents live there. Maybe BOS as B6 flies AUS - BOS nonstop and I can use up those B6 miles to reposition.
3. Wanted to use up DL miles preserve to help MR and UR (especially for Hyatt point transfers).

1. Any advice with flying to FCO/NAP with a 2 y/o
2. Any better routes besides my researched with points listed.

awardtravel,"**TLDR at the bottom.**

This will be my first time using points to travel, so I'm pretty new to this.  I've read the wiki and searched this sub, but I may need a little guidance from someone with more experience than me. 

My partner and I are trying to find the best way to get to Europe from the U.S. in Business Class (J?) using the least amount of points.  Basically, we've got to be in Croatia for a week from Sept 24th to Oct 1st.  However, I figured if we're spending the points, might as well extend the trip a little and maybe see another country or two.  (We've honestly been trying to get time to help out a little in Poland and this seems like the perfect opportunity.)  We're flying out of Pittsburgh, but we don't mind getting a cheap economy flight to somewhere else on the East Coast before taking our Business class trip across the ocean.  Once we get there, we would hang out in whatever country we're in for a few days, get a cheap plane or train ride to Croatia, and do the same thing on the way home.  I figured with how flexible we are this should be pretty simple.

I used AwardHacker and it gave me the (possibly wrong) impression that I could get something like this for around 90k points round trip per person.  However, now that I've actually spent the last few days searching, the best I've found is around 140k per person.  Does that sound right?  In terms of dates, we have about  a week of flexibility both on the way there and on the way back, and we're willing to fly out of many locations in the US, and willing to fly basically anywhere in Europe.  Am I doing something wrong or is this just what it costs?

Here are my details:

**Points:** 

A couple hundred thousand each of Chase and Amex Points

**Flying out of:** 

PIT

**Willing to get a cheap flight first to:**

IAD

ORD

BOS

MIA

JFK

LGA

EWR

TPA

STL

Basically anywhere that isn't going to cost more than a couple hundred a person.

**Flying to:**

Anywhere in Europe really, with the eventual destination of Croatia.  And then the same thing on the way back.

**Departing:**

Anywhere from Sept 18th - Sept 24th (Preferably Sept 19th)

**Returning:** 

Anywhere from Oct 1st - Oct 7th (Preferably Oct 7th)

&amp;#x200B;

**What I've found so far:**

After having trouble with AwardHacker, I've basically been going on each airlines individual websites and searching manually.  Is this the best way to go about this?  Am i missing something?

I first looked for that 34k Iberia flight into Madrid, but it doesn't seem to have business available on those dates.

I then looked into ANA but I can't seem to find anything except for economy.

I found a couple British Airways and Virgin flights using their websites, but they all had $2000 in extra charges per person.  Kinda defeats the purpose at that point.

On Emirates, I found one that's 145k a person.  I guess it's one of the better one's so far but it's more than I wanted to spend.

**Emirates Flight:**

EWR - ATH Round Trip

Sept 19th - Oct 7th

145k per person

&amp;#x200B;

I've also found some United flights for around 140k, which again is a little more than I wanted to spend.  I did actually find a United Polaris one way for 60k that I thought could be decent by itself.

**United Flight:**

LHR - EWR One Way

Oct 6th

60k + $300 per person

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone help me with this?  I've been looking for a couple days now and I'm worried I'm doing this wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Any tips on getting to Europe from the U.S. for low amount of points?  I'm fairly flexible on what cities to fly in and out of.

&gt; Starting July 14, we're expanding your upgrade benefits to include a complimentary upgrade for one companion traveling with you. You’ll no longer need 500-mile upgrades — upgrades for AAdvantage® status members plus one companion are complimentary on flights within North America.

&gt; As a result of this change, we’ll convert all remaining 500-mile upgrades in your account into 250 Loyalty Points each by the end of July, getting you closer to qualifying for status, improving your spot on the upgrade list and unlocking other great benefits.

&gt; We’re committed to enhancing your travel experience, and look forward to seeing you in the skies.",American Airlines converting all 500-mile upgrades to loyalty points by the end of July 2022. Good or bad?,,foghornjawn,,8,7/18/2022 22:14

I am in a position to choose a new alliance for my business travel! I am a consultant and travel a pretty frequent amount, so I am trying to consolidate my travel with a single domestic airline and build some status for loyalty perks and miles. 

I used to be a frequent DL flyer when I was based out of ATL, but I know that in Chicago UA and AA are much better options in terms of ORD as a hub. Do you all have any advice or key decision points that would help me choose between the two? I believe the actual product and flight quality/reliability is pretty comparable between the two, but that might just be my perception coming from Delta haha.

For context, most of my points earning is through UR and MR points on personal spend, and I am only allowed to use my corporate card making earning rate on airline cards not a factor. That being said, lounge access is a really nice perk and would definitely consider opening a lounge card with either airline.

I do try to make a yearly trip to India and/or Singapore, so those might be two international routes of particular interest.

Thanks so much in advance, and let me know if any additional information would be helpful in making this decision.",Help me choose an awards alliance - Chicago ORD,,rohmann98,,3,7/18/2022 20:01

awardtravel,"Okay, worst case scenario came about for me. I had secured an award using Lifemiles on AC from SCL to DCA for me and the better half at business class. Well on Saturday, I was getting caught up on the travel blogs, and I read AC won't resume YYZ-SCL until January. I check my reservation on Air Canada website, and sure enough only YYZ-DCA was left. Not just that, AC had cancelled my connecting YYZ to DCA flight and put me on a later flight. Well, guess what? Lifemiles didn't let me know about either cancellation/change which unfortunately seems to be how the operate. Based upon my reading of the FT forum on Lifemiles here's my understanding: 1) Lifemiles won't do jack **** for me - all I can do is ask for a cancellation, and I'll get my miles back in a matter of days and the taxes less the $25 partner award fee refunded in a few weeks. They won't open up award availability on AV for me, and I'm not finding any desirable award availability during the peak tourism season for Chile. 2) The only business class availability is on CM leaving ~ 3:30am with a connection in PTY. It's recliners, and if lucky I'll get the nicer recliners with the legrest and more pitch. If unlucky, I'll get a product that looks like what domestic USA first used to before carriers started installing slimline seats. If I hit the jackpot, CM will have deployed a 737 MAX 9 with their lie flat business class by the time I travel as SCL-PTY is one of the longer routes they fly. Luckily I have enough miles to make that reservation on CM without waiting for Lifemiles to muck around and give me a refund.

awardtravel,"I just spent the last week trying to put together an ANA RTW itinerary and I just booked it so I thought I would share my experience and information I found along the way because information on travel sites seem to be a bit outdated.

I booked the following on J for two people:

Departing | Arriving | Carrier | Notes
---| --- | --- | ---
IAD | BRU | Brussels Airlines | 3 days
BRU | MXP | Brussels Airlines | 14 days, planning on visiting various places in Italy and Vienna traveling mostly by train.
VIE | FRA | Austrian Airlines | Connection
FRA | ICN | Lufthansa | 10 days
ICN | NRT | Asiana | 6 days 
NRT | TPE | ANA | 4 days
TPE | ORD | Eva | Flying home from Chicago separately

This came out to **115,000 miles** per person and total fees were **$900 per person**. The surcharges were a little high, and partially due to the fact that I wasn't able to get BOS-LIS for two in J with TAP Portugal (more on this below). If I had gone with TAP, then it could have gone down to $630, with most of the surcharges (probably) coming from the VIE-FRA-ICN leg. That one was pretty unavoidable as it was one of the only Europe to Asia flight with two seats in J that I could find for the dates I wanted.  

# TAP Portugal Notes

I had planned out BOS-LIS as the first leg of the flight, but that got blown up when I tried to do it for two people. According to the agent, she was able to book one person in J, but TAP only released one seat in J to them, even though 9 total were available. I tried looking at EWR-LIS and different dates, and they all had the same issue. I went with my backup of IAD-BRU for the US-Europe leg, which added $200 to the surcharges. The BRU-MXP on Brussels ended up having a $70 surcharge, which I maybe could have booked a separate flight for and saved some money, but I decided to go for it anyway. 

# Searching

I did my searching exclusively on ANA's site. United is pretty much useless now, and none of the RTW sites really helped me out very much. ANA doesn't let you look for one-way award flights, though. You need to either look for a round trip flight or an open jaw/multiple city flight to even search for award availability. To get around this, I put in a route that I knew had availability like SIN-BKK for the second flight and simply changed the parameters for the first flight to check for availability. 

So for example, to look for the first flight I might have put in IAD-BRU and SIN-BKK. I only check to see the availability on the first leg and note down the flight information if there is availability. Then, I click on Search Again and change the first flight to something like BOS-LIS (to see if they have availability for that route on that date, for example), keeping the SIN-BKK as it is. Then repeat for every combination of dates and routes.

I wanted to go westward, but finding flights in J from US to Asia was rough. I made sure to find backups for the US-Europe, Europe-Asia, and Asia-US flights just in case, because those were the most important. It was good that I did this, because I had the IAD-BRU alternative ready when BOS-LIS didn't work. Luckily, besides the issue with TAP, everything else went smoothly.

# Calling

I called the number around 10am Eastern time and waiting around an hour before getting a representative. The process was pretty smooth, I just mentioned that I wanted to book an RTW trip for two in business class, and fed them the dates and flight numbers. When the issue with TAP came up, there was additional holding and figuring out alternate routes, but we were able to get it resolved fairly quickly.

awardtravel,"I needed to book a Choice hotel last Saturday, at the last minute. I transferred 14,000 Citi points. It took several attempts, as I kept encountering errors with Citi. When it finally processed, it ended up going through twice, so I had 56,000 Choice points credited. I still have the correct Citi balance, which is only a few hundred. Any experience with Choice reversing such a credit, or Citi clawing back or ending up with a negative balance?",Bank made an error in your favor,,willard717102,,17,7/16/2022 2:07

awardtravel,"Found a few options for an overseas trip on J class with my fiancé. As this is my first time international J class, I don't know much on how airlines differ other than what I've ready online. Looking for personal experiences and opinions on this matter. Thanks.

* Air France JFK to CDG J class on BA777-300ER (55k + $250, one way)
* Emirates EWR to ATH J class on BA777-300ER (72.5k + $84, one way)
* Emirates JFK to MXP J class on A380 (72.5k + $84, one way)
* Singapore Airlines JFK to FRA J class on A380 (81k + $6, one way)

I was trying to find routes with Delta or United J class via codeshare partners, but wasn't able to find any.

I'm thinking most to least favorable would be: SQ, EK (A380), EK (BA777), AF. Do I have that right?

I’d like to cater towards my fiancés priorities, which happen to be food and drink, ambiance, and seat, in that order.

awardtravel,"Hi everyone!

I was lucky enough to snag a couple of first class tickets in Emirates from MXP-JFK next June and I'm currently looking for a way to get to Europe.

I'm open to arriving in Spain, London, Paris, Geneva and Zurich. Maybe even Italy but I'd rather not since my trip will end there. I'm looking at a 2 week trip so May 25-27th would be best. 

I'm based out of Denver and I've looked at numerous different options. I have 280k MR left. I saw on Cathay I can book a flight from Denver connecting in London to Barcelona for 75k miles plus $450, which doesn't seem too bad, since it's my home base. 

Ideally I would book JFK-BCN on Iberia but business is sold out on the dates I'm looking for. Should I just suck it up and book Premium Economy and Southwest my way to New York?

I've also looked at Swiss airlines through Avianca but it looks like they release award space a couple weeks before the date. I've looked at a bunch more like Virgin Atlantic, Delta, booking AA through Ethiad Guest but nothing seems worth it right now. 

Am I missing anything? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

UPDATE: I ended up booking British Airways J from Denver to Heathrow for 2 (wife and I) for 122k points and $772. Honestly, really happy with that redemption.",Best one way to Europe?,,sircharles94,,10,7/15/2022 18:24

I made the bookings for 4 of us to fly business SEA-&gt;NRT on JAL a long time ago in the hopes that japan would be open by the time our Sep 15-&gt;26th itinerary came around, but it looks like we are going to have to cancel and find somewhere else to go.

With that, i am looking for help to see if anyone has seen business availability at a decent price for 4 people from Seattle/SFO to anywhere. I would love to go elsewhere in Asia but at this point am open for just about anywhere i can find availability to go to that is taking tourists.


from: SEA or SFO/SJC/OAK

to: Anywhere (Would love BKK, MNL, SIN if i were to make a preference)

programs w/ substantial miles: Alaska, BA, Delta, or anything transferable from Chase UR / Amex MR

when: flexible dates, but needs to be bounded between Sept. 15th and Sept 26th.
