backpacking,"Hello everyone! Can we make a brainstorm and find a way for me to get a Schengen visa? I will be very grateful if you can give me some ideas.

I am from Turkey and unfortunately I need a visa to visit Europe. I worked as a teacher for 6 years. Then I quit my job to travel full time 2 years ago. I have 4 old Schengen visas, one of them was for one year. But when I got those visas, I was a student or I had a good job so I had all the documents they asked for. If you don’t have a job, money, or something that keeps you in your county(like school, or properties etc) it’s almost impossible to get a tourist visa. And right now I don’t have anything. I am just a full time traveler without money and job. But that gives me freedom, I can do whatever to get a visa. I can apply to universities or I can find a temporary job, language courses, even fake marriage hahah

My goal is just to be able to visit Europe. If I apply for a tourist visa, they’ll refuse me. Do you have any other ways to apply? Considering that I don’t have money in my bank account.

Probably people who needs visa for Schengen like me will understand and help me better. Thanks in advance for your help.

Additionally: Someone will probably ask me how I travel if I don’t have money. I use couchsurfing and workaway to not to pay anything for accommodation. I cook for myself and barely eat outside. I am trying not to spend anything. And sometimes I get some online jobs, just a side hustle not an actual job. And that’s enough for my little expenses.",Can you help me to find a way to get Schengen visa,,ipek-kara,,0,2023-04-01 21:43:59

backpacking,"Doing another Southeast Asia tour starting this summer and was reminiscing on a four day stay I did in Bankok in 2016. Initially, I went to Thailand to get my scuba diving certs, but the entire southern part of the country was being hit by rainstorms, including both sides of the gulf of Thailand, so I couldn’t do any diving and was stuck in Bangkok before defecting to Bali (on the advice of a Russian guy staying at my hostel).

Some positives/negatives during my time there:

1. The SMELL. The entire city smells like sewage.…or like the entire Thai population farted together at one time (negative).
2. The rats. I saw several giant brown ones the size of poodles (the small kind) running down sidewalks before lunging into gaping holes in the concrete, and was thinking to myself that NYC probably has no idea what a real rodent problem is (negative).
3. Khao San Road. I went to party with other backpackers on the infamous Khao San Road, and as soon as I exited my taxi, a literal monsoon hit and started dumping rain on that area of town, threatening to interrupt my festivities while drenching me. As I pivoted in the middle of the street in an attempt to haul ass to cover underneath an overhang on the side of street, I almost ran over a tiny, middle aged Thai woman who appeared out of nowhere and handed me an umbrella. This magical little lady saved the day by getting me a water repellant device in less than exactly 30 seconds after the rain hit, and for the mega friendly price of 100 Baht (3 bucks). I was more than impressed, and thought she might actually be an angel in disguise (positive).
4. Khao San Road. Later that afternoon, I accidentally stepped in a giant rain puddle with both feet while crossing the road to another bar. No, I didn’t see it, and yes, I was drunk. Two days later, I had to purchase and use an anti fungal cream on my feet due to an athlete’s-foot-like fungus that I picked up from the rain puddle. Also, the new pair of $170 Adidas shoes—$200 in today’s dollars when adjusted for inflation—I was stupidly wearing when I stepped in the puddle had to be completely immersed in a bucket of anti fungal liquid, then rinsed off in a swimming pool. They were never the same afterwards (negative).
5. Khao San Road/Thai hospitality. Later that night (early the next morning, actually), I was taken home from probably the seventh bar I’d been to on Khao San during that particular party session by a cute Thai girl who fed me some great Thai food before I drunkenly passed out in her bed. When I woke up the next morning, I was sure that I’d find at least one of my internal organs had been harvested and sold on the black market. But to my surprise, everything, including my kidneys, were intact. She even got me a cab back to my hostel (although she was a little annoyed that I was too hung over to have sex 😆). Try finding that kind of hospitality in your home country (positive).
6. Muay Thai fights. The second night I was in Bankok, I got ringside seats to some professional Muay Thai fights at one of the two large arenas in town for the laughably low price $42. Ever seen a movie featuring martial arts fights set in some third world country where the arena‘s seating areas are divided up into socioeconomic classes: ringside/floor seating for the society’s affluent class, followed next by bleachers for whatever small middle class actually exists in the country, and then a huge nosebleed section cordoned off by a 10 foot high chain link fence behind which a mob of drunk, rowdy lower class guys are holding fistfuls of the local currency while shouting randomly at anyone/everyone/each other and attempting to make bets for or against fighters? This was that. Not kidding. I loved it. And even though every one of the fighters were smaller than the average UFC flyweight, and I’m pretty sure some of them were about 15 years old, out of the eight fights I saw, three ended in knockouts by kick to the head. Two words: Pretty epic. Would definitely go again, and might (positive).

I won’t be spending any more time than necessary in Bankok when I head back to Thailand this summer, except maybe to see a few more glorious Thai fights…..but wondering what other takes/stories people have of it or other cities in Southeast Asia?",Anyone a Bankok fan?,,Huh_questionmark1,,0,2023-04-01 02:41:33

backpacking,"Hi! We are Alex, Randy, and Abby, a group of three American college students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute working on a research project with the City Wanderer non-profit organization in Taipei to help Taiwanese youth find purpose and meaning in life. Our team has learned that the achievement-based education system in Taiwan can limit students' ability to explore their passions and find what is right for them in life and we’re exploring backpacking as a means to help these students develop and find purpose. Our focus is on the impact of backpack traveling on young people, particularly on how it can help build one's sense of self in the world, foster global citizenship, and encourage a sense of responsibility for the world. We hope that our research can help the City Wanderer organization to develop new and exciting programs incorporating backpacking to help more lost youth find purpose and meaning in their lives.

We would really appreciate it if you took 10-20 minutes to fill out the following survey to help us learn about your experiences with backpacking and traveling in Taiwan and abroad! The survey is fully confidential and will only be used by our team for the purposes of this study. There is an option to fill it out in Mandarin and in English depending on your preference.

Thank you for taking the time to help us on our project. We are also looking for backpackers to interview about their experiences so we would appreciate it if you could contact us at the email below if you have any questions about the survey or are interested in helping us more.

您好！我們是Alex、Randy和Abby，來自美國的三位大學生，目前台北與「城市浪人」非營利組織合作進行研究项目，旨在協助臺灣青年找到生命中的目的與意義。我們的團隊發現臺灣的成就導向教育體系可能限制學生探索自己的熱情所在以及生涯方向。因此我們藉由背包旅行，協助這些學生探索和尋找人生目標。我們的研究注重於背包旅行對年輕人的影響，特別是在如何幫助建立個人對世界的認知，培養全球公民意識，並鼓勵青年承担世界责任。我們希望此研究能幫助「城市浪人」開發新穎的計畫，並結合背包旅行，協助更多年輕人找到人生目標與意義。

若您願意花費 10-20 分鐘的時間填以下問卷，幫助我們了解您在臺灣及海外的背包旅行經驗，我們將非常感激。問卷是完全保密的，只會被我們的團隊用於研究。根據您的喜好，問卷有中文和英文版本可供選擇。

感謝您撥冗協助我們的项目。此外，我們還在尋找背包客訪談，如果您有任何問題或有興趣更多協助我們，請透過以下電子郵件聯絡我們：

Jinli, one of the symbols of Chengdu, was restored by the Chengdu Wuhou Temple Museum, and as part of the Wuhou Temple, the street is 550 meters long. Now it is a famous Ming and Qing Dynasty architectural pedestrian street in Chengdu, and it is also the commercial street that can best reflect Chengdu folk customs, which is an antique building in the architectural style of the late Qing Dynasty and early Min, with the Three Kingdoms culture and Sichuan traditional folk culture as the main content. The layout of the ancient street is rigorous and orderly, with bar entertainment area, Sichuan dining and snack area, Fudi inn area, and special tourism handicraft exhibition and sales area. This is one of the most popular attractions in Chengdu for foreign tourists, and it is also a famous food street, and there are so many snacks here that it is simply mouth-watering.

Chengdu belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate, with the characteristics of early spring, hot summer, cool autumn and warm winter, with an average annual temperature of about 16 degrees Celsius, cloudy and foggy, short sunshine time and humid air.

So far our Itinerary is Athens, 16th-19th. Then Budapest, 19th-22nd. 

I was looking for any places you all would recommend going. I am open to anything! (Maybe not Russia...)

In addition, I wanted to ask how to plan a trip, but also leave room for spontaneous trips to places we learn about on the way. My main concerns are hostels and plane tickets because they are much cheaper to purchase in advance.

backpacking,"So last year I did a pilgrimage with a family member, its a 100 km four day trek and I had issues with my knees as it was my first time hiking and I didn't take proper precautions to prevent it. This year im going again and hopefully by myself, and am wondering what backpack would be best for me, but its a jungle and since im walking alone im probably having to go a bit heavier than what i believe was around 10 kg last year. family member carried stuff like sleeping gear.

I prioritize a balance between comfortability in the sense of having everything i need, and walking without too much heavy weight strain on my knees. I have glanced at the Ospreys and other backpacks and wonder how many litres would be appropriate for me, also other input or anecdotes would be greatly appreciated as I'm generally clueless in these departments tbh.

backpacking,"Backpacking solo is one of my favorite things in the world. I realize that for females going on a trip, especially backpacking, can seem pretty daunting. What are some tips you've learned along the way?

A few of mine:

* Always have at least the first night of the hotel booked in any new town you are staying. When you are sleep deprived and jet lagged you can be not as alert as you need to be and the last thing you want to do is stumble around a new city searching for a place to stay that is safe.
* Dress code - a lot of places around the world, women need to be more covered up. Some places they like you to be more modest you can get away with shorts and a tank top but it draws unnecessary attention. Always bring long pants and and long sleeves. When in doubt, I always try to cover up more.
* Have multiple credit cards and debit cards. Keep them in different places. - this goes for everyone.
* Never go out alone at night. Always be with a group. Same for early morning before people are out on the streets. I learned this the hard way in Thailand once.
* If you drink, don't get too messed up with people you just met or at the local bar. If you do drugs.... just don't if you are solo on the other side of the world. If you have to, wait to get back to your hostel to drink more/take anything.
* I've found that each country/location has different scams. Do some research beforehand to get an idea of what you might encounter and need to watch out for.
* Don't wear too much makeup/glam up. I make myself look kind of poor and not very attractive most of the time, unless it's something extra special I have planned. I already stick out like a sore thumb as a blonde white girl, no need to try to more.
* No brand names. It's also a little ridiculous to walk around a 3rd world country with $500 shoes/backpack. I've seen it happening a lot lately on backpacker routes and am always pretty shocked.

Those are just a couple, but I'm wondering what other people have found useful for them.",Tips For Solo Female Backpackers,,Jenneefur1985,,0,2023-03-30 04:39:50

backpacking,"This subreddit focuses heavily on the positive experiences, but I'm interested in hearing the negatives.

My first trip is two months and it's been full of highs and lows. The lows have come from unexpected places. Observations and experiences that have heavily affected my outlook on the world. I won't talk about some of the worst things, but here are a few that I experienced.

I'm Australian and I've never really seen the homeless problem like I did in the Manila. It was a difficult and emotional experience. I'll always remember the little girl, 8 years old sitting on the side of the highway. She had ragged clothes, no shoes and the worst part? She was holding a little baby in her arms. I saw many other examples of it and I'd never seen anything so sad in my life.

I've been in Japan for about a month now. Something I've learned about backpacking is that the increased amount of time in any location gives you the luxury of actually looking around and observing what's around you, as opposed to standard travelling where you race from one tourist attraction to the next.

One observation I made in Tokyo was the sheer despair that some people exhibited. A young woman of about 24 fell asleep on my shoulder on the train after struggling to stop herself from nodding off for a few minutes. Normally Japanese like to keep away from foreigners on the trains, so it surprised me. I don't know what she was going through, but I could see on her face that it was something very hard.

In Tokyo, I saw so many businessmen that looked on the edge of deaths door. They had the saddest expressions and were deeply tired, worn to the brink. I learned speaking to a Japanese student that most Japanese people don't get any vacation time, and many of them work long hours 6 days a week. I couldn't wrap my head around it. How can anyone live like that in the modern day? When I learned of the work culture, everything I'd seen suddenly had greater significance. 

I visited Hiroshima for obvious reasons, but I truly didn't expect the effect it had on me. I was walking randomly during the night [when I came across this statue](https://i.imgur.com/sVkzyJU.jpg). I didn't need to check. I knew where I was. The scene was especially emotional at night with nobody around. The sheer scale of the tragedy never really hit me like it did when I was standing there and saw the pain with my own eyes. I spent most of my time in Hiroshima just walking around with a massive pain in my chest.

The friends I met along the way, and the ones I've made recently have made these experiences easier to deal with. The trip has been filled with the best experiences of my life, and some dark experiences as well. It's everything I wanted from adventuring. Travelling has made me realise that we really have everything in Australia.

Is this backpack a good quality bag for such a big trip.  I see mixed reviews, and I bought it way back in the day because it was on sale at REI.  I don't want to get a new bag of I don't need one, but I also want to be equipped properly for such a big trip.

backpacking,"so, as the title suggests..... how do people deal with snorers in hostels?

I will be backpacking for the first time soon and I will spend a considerable amount in hostels. Recently I experienced a nose injury, and now, when I am super tired/drunk I snore. sometimes it is barely anything, but sometimes I snore like a bear (the drunker/more tired the worse). 

Anything that I should do in this case because I do not want to keep everyone awake all the time? or any recommendations on how I can tackle this issue?

Hi guys. My girlfirned and I (both 30, living in Perth) are planning a trip to north east asia to do at some point during 2023.

In the past i have done a 2 month trip in SEA and China (several places in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, KL, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shangai) so I already know a little bit regarding travel distances and considerations specially in China.

Having said that, we want to go mostly new places for both but I dont mind repeating some stuff as everything is awesome. China has blown my mind so I wanna spend around 20 days there, as well as Taipei that is a must and we are really excited to go to.

Main concerns:

* Is going only to Taipei OK if travelling to Taiwan? We saw several other places inside the country but nothing was as appealing as other places of the itinerary.
* Weather for Guilin/Yuangshuo/Zhangiaje. Do they have the same ""good"" season for sighsteeing? I have been fascinated with those places for the past 10 years, but if we go there we really want to minimize the chances of getting bad weather/fog (i remember the fog/cold situation in Ha Long Bay for example).
* Adding South Corea makes sense? With the itinerary detailed below we still have some space to add some stuff or even exchange some days.
* Dates. Which time you think is better to go during 2023? We have no constraints so thats a plus.

Thanks!!

backpacking,"Hello fellow travellers, backpackers and campers. I have a trip in mind that I had a long think about last night and got into a rabbit hole looking at pricing and locations what not. The issue being it’s pretty tough to at first look establish good areas in chosen countries with good access via public transport. 

TLDR: Destinations with wilderness areas accessible fairly easily via public transport from nearest airport for 4 day bivi camp trip. 

I was picking up unbelievably low priced flights to Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and many others with great rules for outdoor backpacking/bivi camping, my issue is finding a good spot where myself and my friend could take 3-4 days hiking around the wilderness and staying in our bivis away from civilisation that is however accessible by air then train.

So my question is, has anyone done a European trip like this where you backpack on the flight over, train or bus to an area, do your planned trip then returned back? If so, please send destination ideas! Ideally an area that isn’t going to break the bank getting public transport out to it from the airport. I would absolutely love to hear of your experiences, any unforeseen issues you may have come across that you’d not considered previous to the trip and any advice with planning/executing a trip like this!

backpacking,"Hello travellers, I am writing this post with a heavy heart, still not believing what i had to survive through as a young female backpacker.. Its very hard for me to talk about this situation as it is very recent and still happening right now but things like that should be heard and I hope it will spread awarness. 
Recently I was attacked while walking home in Tulum, Mexico. It was night. I thought i would save up money for the taxi as it was only 1km to go and whoever visited Tulum knows how crazy expencive taxis are here. I thank God I had strenght not to lose conciousness while my head was smashed against the ground multiple times and was able to stand up when I had a chance to run and survive. I thank God I had someone to take me to the hospital as I woudnt even know where to go or how to speak in spanish at that time and condition. And I pray everyday I will find the right way to heal and rise up from where I am now mentally and physically. One of the worst part of this is that police isnt willing to do much..i feel so unsafe and alone in general and having the people that are suppost to protect you make you wait 4hours until they are even willing to talk to you while you are barely able to walk and then not even ask that many questions just feels like too much to handle..
No one should go through this and for those beautiful souls who did I am so sorry and my heart is with you❤️
My phone, credit cards, cash were stolen, my friend helped me with her last money to pay the hospital bill which i wouldnt be able to pay even if i had my credit card as I didnt have that amount of money in my bank account.. if any of you pals are in Tulum and have a phone that you are not using that would also help tons as i dont feel safe not having a device through which i could connect or call for help on me.. not talking about the fact that I dont know how I will need to fly back home without it…

backpacking,"Hello friends and travelers!

My partner and I are taking our 3 year old Australian shepherd in our Subaru Outback on a 3 week trip from south west Florida to Los Angeles California.  

The trip coincides with us moving cross country as well, but after eliminating all unnecessary stuff we are managing to fit everything on our roof, on a hitch, and in our trunk with plenty of room to spare. 

Over the course of trip, we plan to spend as much time possible taking in nature and hikes and rivers and valleys and mountains and so on and so forth as much as possible. We only plan to stop in cities for more groceries and an occasional dinner out.  Yay nature!

We plan to utilize our coolers and food prep;  Sleep in our car; And be outdoors as much as possible where it’s safe and accessible for our dog.  

This is where we need help/advice.  The trip starts April 18th and ends around May 9th. 

We definitely want to go to Colorado, and the Grand Canyon.   But asides from that we don’t really know.  We want to see greenery and flowers and color more so than dessert and rock.  And we’d also be happy checking out a large festival or event or something. But we’d generally like to avoid city activities.  

And between north Florida/Chattanooga area to Colorado, we aren’t sure at all what to look at.

backpacking,"Hello all,

Some friends and I went backpacking a couple of years ago at an be altitude of about 8,600 ft (we live at about 2,500ft). That is a pretty tame altitude differential, so I'd not thought it would be an issue. However, one of my friends had a very difficult time with it given his level of fitness and sustaining what sounds to have been severe lung scarring when he was a kid. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach to planned destination (we were all alright with this, as the main goal was to just hang out).

He is open to trying it again, and we've been periodically doing some short rucks in our area to help build up to it. Aside from low-altitude fitness conditioning, is there anything else we can do to help him get ready for it? From having gone to Breckenridge for skiing I know some things like drinking a bunch of water and not drinking alcohol in the couple days before the trip would be a good idea, but I'm looking for any other recommendations that could help him (either as far as training goes, or short-term stuff like the hydration and no alcohol).

backpacking,"Hi everyone!

I wanted to share my experience with GlobeSisters - a hospitality exchange platform tailored for women-identifying folks like myself. As someone who loves to travel and explore new cultures, it has been an amazing resource for me.

One of the best things about the platform is that all of the hosts are women-identifying and ID-checked, which gives me peace of mind when I'm travelling alone. During my travels, I've had the opportunity to stay with hosts in different parts of the world, and it's been an incredible way to immerse myself in local cultures.

This platform has also allowed me to save money on accommodation, which is always a plus when you're travelling on a budget. Not only that, but I've made some amazing connections with the hosts I've stayed with and have even formed lifelong friendships. I highly recommend it to any female traveller looking for trusted accommodation solutions.

We're not that keen on too crowded trails so we've been looking at other trails than Everest base camp and Annapurna Circuit.

I've narrowed it down to these three but would like some feedback on what would be the best option to also have sufficient time for exploring the rest of Nepal.

Manaslu circuit. Looks super interesting and varied in nature. Was not too keen on having to bring a guide but it seems like you can't trek without a guide from this year onward. Mainly worried about the length of the trek being too long for us to see anything else.

Khopra Ridge. Seems to fit the bill length wise, nature wise, and crowd wise, but I'm worried that it will be too easy compared to other treks - even when adding the Khayer lake at 4600m. We want a challenge when we're in the freaking Himalayas. Will this be challenging?

Everest three passes trek. Now this is a challenge and maybe even a bit too much. It seems like the bare minimum is 17 days and you need to factor in possible delays. The views look amazing though. Are they worth it even if it means seeing less of the rest of Nepal?

backpacking,"So I was a US Marine for 8 years. In that time period I humped hundreds upon hundreds of miles with a 45lb + pack (base weight) with cotton utilities, heavy danner boots (unless I was using my bates lites), body armor (sometimes worn, sometimes stowed) plus ammo, weapons (small arms and crew served). You get it, HEAVY AF. We would march up to 20 miles a day in column or ranger file. 

I say all that not as any kind of flex because I firmly believe the military genuinely needs to hike that way. It’s not recreational. I learned how to evenly distribute weight in my pack, where to optimal wear my hip belt, etc.

But in spite of all that, my love for camping, hiking, and backpacking never diminished. Just the way the Marines did it. 

Are there any suggestions from military vets that picked up backpacking post EAS that may make a section hike on the AT more pleasurable? Or at least less crappy than my experience in the Marines.

I guess I need to vent a bit, I don't know why I'm so annoyed, but I have close friends who recently started traveling as their financial situation is really good right now, and I'm happy for them. I've been traveling for many years, mostly backpacking, didn't always have money to spend but I'd make it work by staying in the dingiest hostels just to see things. 

The thing is, they will take a 10 hour flight and then not really see anything. They went to Tunisia and not even once they tried local food. It had to be all European restaurants. They came to visit me in North America (I live in a big city) and didn't want to  walk or see anything, they rented a car and wanted to drive everywhere (you can't experience or see a city in a car). I wanted to introduce them to some new fun foods, they only wanted McDonalds or something theyve seen in a movie. Then they've decided to explore other places and basically drove for hours, stopped in another city for the evening, go out for food and drinks, drive to yet another city the next day, rinse and repeat. Thousands and thousands of dollars spent. No walking, no museums, no history, no cuisines, no exploring of any kind. Just driving through Midwest trying to tick off as many cities as possible without actually really seeing a single one. Their social media are full of amazing, nicely edited photos that paint a picture of them as these globetrotters.

 And I don't even know why I'm annoyed, i shouldn't give a shit but it seems.... wasteful?

the rolling carry on seems VERY cumbersome if/WHEN i have to navigate steps.

backpacking,"I've always had an issue with hipstraps, namely that I'm already carrying stuff on my hips, guns, knives, magazines, flashlights, etc as EDC gear and I refuse to relocate these items somewhere where they aren't accessible or aren't concealed or aren't comfortable.  The best solution I've discovered for carrying heavy loads in a pack, where shoulder straps alone are inadequate, is to use a tumpline.  For those unfamiliar, a tumpline is a strap that goes over your head.  You're supporting the weight with your whole spinal column.  This is how people all over the world have portaged heavy loads for milleniums.  You've seen them in national geographic.  (It's better than a hipstrap.)[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/tumplines/537306/]

The only problem is that it can be challenging to properly attach a tumpline to quality large-capacity backpacks.  A tumpline has to be secured at the bottom of the load so that the straps meet your head at the proper angle, and with most backpacks there isn't a good way to attach straps to the sides down at the bottom.  So I'm forced to use a pack frame, which I don't really care for.

I've found lots of threads on shooting/self defense forums where guys are complaining about hip straps, so I know it's not just me.  Their solutions are pretty stupid, usually involving pocket carrying little subcompacts they can't even shoot, or using drop leg holsters that don't conceal the weapon and don't allow the weight to secure to the hips properly.  Tumplines are the superior solution here in my opinion because you can carry and conceal full size gear on your hip without changing your EDC/CCW system at all.  Backpack companies need to pay attention and start producing tumpline packs or making them tumpline-compatible, because right now they're competing against no-name Chinese pack frames off Amazon for the CCW American market.",Why don't people use tumplines?

But I don't want to travel alone. As all my friends either have kids or can't get much time off work I don't really have anyone to travel with.

So I'm wondering if anyone might be open to that idea? Whether for a few days or few weeks it doesn't matter. 

I'm still working out the details but the idea would be you'll travel with me in the van but sleep in a separate tent. You'll still have access to the on board toilet at night and the bathroom and kitchen during the day. (I'm also thinking about getting a few ebikes to ride). From there we can use it as a base camp and go on hiking or biking trips.

Money wise - you'll buy your own food. We would split fuel and accommodation costs. (But the van will be off grid capable so we would just stay at free camp sites.)

I also fear not having an income stream but I figure I should have more than enough time to learn and get into a digital career field that could potentially fund this dream long term.

Basically, I fly into Barcelona, and am giving myself 4 weeks to get to Rome via Eurail, buses, and perhaps one flight (Madrid to Paris). From Rome I fly to Athens for the last two weeks to island hop, and then fly home out of Athens. I wanted to go:

Barcelona, (maybe Valencia but I’m unsure), Madrid, Paris, Lyon (maybe) Bern, Bologna, Venice, Florence, Rome. 
Then Athens, and perhaps 2 islands in Greece, although unsure which ones.

\- I'm solo travelling (have done this in SEA before so not a total newbie)

\- Staying in hostels is a preference

\- Ideally I want to travel via buses and trains rather than car (although I've heard this can be challenging in the US?)

\- I'm keen to check out at least one national park

\- One route I have looked at is Vancouver - Seattle - Portland - San Fran - Yosemite - etc

(Go ahead, rip me apart, I'll wait 😂) Regardless, I still look for ways to lighten my load without sacrificing my luxury items.

This winter, I upgraded my backpack and sleep system which dropped my base weight down about 3.5 to 4lbs. Earlier this year, while talking about these upgrades with a buddy, I joked about how it was all for naught because I probably gained about 10lbs over the holidays (I've since lost all 10 and then some). We both knew that 10lbs on my body was not the same as 10lbs on my pack, but we weren't sure exactly what the ratio is. Best info I found was annecdotal claims that it's basically a 5:1ratio. Meaning, that the 10lbs I gained and lost is basically 2lbs of ""pack weight.""

So, my question is, is this ratio accurate? And, do you know of any evidence or good articles to support this or some other more accurate ratio?",Pack weight vs Body weight?,,awhit102,,0,2023-03-18 19:07:27
backpacking,"Hi All,

I’m returning home from a trip to the Amazon near Iquitos, Peru. While there, I have been bit by what I think are bed bugs and as a result I’m concerned that the bed bugs made their way on to my clothes and in my luggage. From what I hear, the consequences of bringing bed bugs home can be quite irritating and costly, so I am looking for routes to avoid spreading them into my home. 

I read online the best way to kill the bed bugs once I return home is to wash my belongings with detergent on a high heat setting and then tumble dry on a high heat setting, but my issue with this is that much of my belongings (clothes, backpack, etc.) would get damaged by the high heat. As a result, I’m looking for alternatives. One alternative I found is to dry clean my belongings to kill the bed bugs them. My plan as of now is to wash and tumble dry on high heat the clothes that can withstand the high heat, and I’ll take the remaining clothes and belongings to the dry cleaner. 

Any thoughts?

backpacking,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Just a quick introduction, this post is about any advice the veteran travellers would have for me as a 19-year-old first-time solo female autistic traveller! My autism is high functioning but I do get overwhelmed by busy environments and lots of people easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am competent, confident, have good common sense and will not be a liability when travelling: I am sensible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to the Philippines in June for 40 days. 10 days of that will be an organised tour at the beginning and for 7 days I will be staying with family in Leyte. For around 20 days I will be alone. The tour ends in Coron so my plan is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Coron--&gt; Siquijor--&gt;Bohol--&gt;Moalboal--&gt;Boracay--&gt;Malay--&gt;Rombolon??? --&gt; Tacloban--&gt; Southern Leyte with family --&gt; Manilla.

&amp;#x200B;

Please could any of you kind people advise me on the following:

&amp;#x200B;

\-The optimal blend of flexibility with my plans and pre-booking? As in set dates for certain destinations and pre-booking tours or just go with the flow and make it up as I go along. I don't want to overschedule and things to be too rigid. 

\-The likelihood I may meet new people and which areas would be best to do so

\- Areas/tours that are best to avoid as they are too western or packed e.g a nice attraction that is too commercialised and no longer enjoyable.

\-Essential things to pack

\- Any anecdotes, tips or tricks that could be helpful perhaps about your experiences solo travelling

\- If I should add or take anything away from my itinerary 

(Ideally, I want a mix of going to sociable places and then going somewhere remote to zen out but where I may not feel too lonely - so not exclusive couple resorts where I won't meet anyone lol)

\-And lastly, any must-see places or things to experience!

I don't mind staying in hostels at all but I will not want to stay in shared dorms and I am iffy on shared bathrooms too. I want to travel for a relatively cheap amount but budget is not particularly an issue as I have saved a few thousand.

Thank you so much for reading this far. I tried to lay it out clearly but I apologise if it is a torrent of information. Any advice on travel between those places would be particularly helpful too!

backpacking,"Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster. 

I'll be taking 6 months off my job in April to travel, and will be using the first \~1.5 months of my time to backpack through Western Europe. I've done a LOT of research on where to go / what to do but wanted to post here to get some feedback on my itinerary, get suggestions on activities / places, and see if anyone had recommendations on a backpack.

A little about myself, I'm 25M living in NYC who basically travels for a living (took 50 flights last year), so lots of experience with travel but have never really been to Western Europe before. I enjoy all sports (but mainly basketball and football), food, people watching, comedy, poker, ancient history, amateur photography and any unique / quirky experiences. I'm a decent fan of nightlife too and plan to be indulging in it at a moderate rate during my trip. Not the biggest museum / historical person but planning to hit some of the most famous ones. Will be staying in hostels for most of the trip with the occasional hotel or two to break it up. Looking to do the whole trip for about $7500.

Now, on to my itinerary. I'll be in Europe for 47 days total, with the following rough plan (in order):

* London (5 days)
* Paris (4 days)
* Amsterdam (4 days)
* Berlin (4 days)
* Prague (2 days)
* Vienna (2 days)
* Venice (3 days)
* Bologna (3 days)
* Florence (4 days)
* Rome (5 days)
* Sanremo (3 days - local poker tournament)
* Milan (2 days)
* Ibiza (2 days)
* Barcelona (2 days)
* Paris (2 days + flight back to NYC)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, on to my main questions

* Itinerary
   * Is my current itinerary too much? Worried I won't have enough down time, even though I plan to lay pretty low in Prague / Vienna and in Sanremo
   * Given my current itinerary, any suggestions on activities that would be fun to do / places to stay / things to see? I've got a hostel booked for London and Ibiza but nothing else yet.
* Backpack
   * I'm planning to get a \~30L backpack to use on the trip, one that can be used as a carry on for Norse Atlantic / Ryannair tipe flights, with a fanny pack serving as my daypack. I've done a lot of research on bags, looking to get one under $200 but can't settle on anything so would greatly appreciate any recommendations.

I have used Lighterpack for a while, but really wanted a way to create a list of items I was bringing on a trip to see base weight without having to re-add items to a new list.

Then you can add those items to your ""Pack"" to see what items you are bringing for a specific trip and the total weight.

You can check it out here. [**https://coda.io/@ben-peine/camping-equipment-list**](https://coda.io/@ben-peine/camping-equipment-list) Copy the doc to be able to use it for your own gear.

Matter of fact, every backpack I have ever brought onto a flight has been too big to be a personal item, but I’ve never been charged.

So the way I see it, if I have a 50% shot at it, I’m gonna try to pass it. If not, ill have to put the empty pack in my checked bag and use a different pack as my carry on.

backpacking,"My boyfriend and I are going on our first backpacking trip in Europe this summer and I don't know what to buy for my handbag. We are going to move a lot: Spain, France, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia, Turkey and Egypt. So, my boyfriend and I each bought a backpack to bring our stuff on the airplanes as carry ons (Cabin Zero Classic 36L). My problem is that I need a daypack to carry the essentials for when I will leave my backpack at my hostel when I won't be traveling to the next country on that day. 

I looked up to some blogs but I didn't seem to find quite what I am looking for, hence why I am asking here. I want a bag that can contain my phone, my passport, a snack, my Airpods, my wallet and if possible, my water bottle (asking to experienced backpackers: how do you bring  water around??). I also want it to be as fashionable and as small as possible, since I won't bring another bag and I could go clubbing and raving, to a restaurant, to a museum, or just walking in the city with it. It needs to be safe (I heard that you need to watch for pickpockets) also. I don't know if I am asking for an impossible bag but I wish it could fit with my aesthetic. I really love brutalist, minimalist, East European fashion - think techno music, that's pretty much it. I saw the Nike sling bag on Pinterest and it sparked my attention, but I worry it might be too big. On the reviews I read, I only found crossbody cute bags that are really not my vibe or hiking things. I would like to find a middle ground that fit a techno music lover!

I don't quite know if a crossbody bag, fanny pack or (small to medium) sling bag would be the best in my situation. It also needs to be easy to carry for the days when I do have to travel with my backpack (I'm not quite fond of the reversed small backpack look, so I'm not very much looking for that either). I think that a fanny pack or sling bag would be the best since clubbing while keeping a hand on a crossbody purse so it doesn't bump everything or get stolen is not very fun, but I am once again asking for the advice of wiser than me. 

To make it short:

\- What size of bag would I need to carry my essentials during the day?

\- What kind of bag would be the best (sling bag, fanny pack, etc.) in my situation? 

\- What bag do you recommend?

\- How do I carry water around? Water bottle recommendations that would maybe fit?

backpacking,"Heya,

Planning a trip to Jammu &amp; Kashmir in a few months time as part of a larger journey around India and I'm after the opinion of some people who have been there recently on how safe it is.

From what I can gather online, it seems to be fine for travellers at the moment. Whilst there is a risk of flare ups and unrest, it looks stable currently and a lot of people travel there and have a great, trouble free time. (I might be way off though - hence asking!)

The UK Foreign Office advises against travel in the region though, and many first hand sources I've found are a few years out of date - so I'd really appreciate any thoughts from people who have been there recently.

My plan is to travel from Dharamsala to Jammu, then Jammu up to Srinagar by bus, also staying in a couple of places like Gulmarg and Pahalgam.

backpacking,"Sorry for the long post - I’m not even sure if this is the right thread - but I would really appreciate some advice/perspective 

TLDR worried I’ll regret temporarily leaving my partner behind and quitting my job to travel SEA with a friend for 3-4 months. Anxiety about this is becoming debilitating and making me want to cancel my trip. 

Over the last year or so myself and a friend (both 24F) have been planning a backpacking trip around SEA for around 3 months. I’ve always dreamt of this type of longer term travel and up until more recently I’ve been so excited about all the new cultures and adventures I’ll get to experience and see. 

I had to delay the trip as I was on a long wait list for surgery, in the meantime, I’ve gotten into a relationship which I’ve now been in for around 7 months. 

Before we got together I made it clear that I had plans to travel with my friend in the near future. He understood it would be difficult but never tried to stop me going, and assured me he will wait for me and that he even hopes to visit for two or three weeks during our trip.

Cut to now and I had my surgery last month, so planning for our trip is in full swing. We’re aiming to jet off in May, but now it’s becoming real, everyday I’m struck with anxiety and dread about this trip I was once so excited about. 

I know it’s mostly because I will miss my SO. We’re still in a very exciting part of our relationship and I’m sad that it will be put on hold for a few months. I have FOMO about the things I will miss with him over the summer. I can’t help but feel super guilty about leaving and I’m even worried I will no longer enjoy the trip due to missing him and feeling bad doing all these exciting things whilst leaving him behind. There’s also the fear that although currently he’s 100% confident he will wait, that all this time apart will ultimately be too difficult whilst he is stuck at home in the same routine without me.

He is the best partner I’ve ever had, he makes happy every day, I can see a future with him without a doubt. I fear travelling puts that at risk and I would not want to go if it meant the end. 
Is it more common than I think, for someone to travel for a longer period of time without their partner? Or am I stupid for thinking this could work? My travel friend is single so I’m struggling to relate to anyone. 

Work wise, my marketing job only offered me 1 month career break, so I will have to resign. I enjoy the job very much - it offers hybrid working, 30 days annual leave, plus bank holidays, PLUS almost two weeks off for Christmas. However the role doesn’t offer much progression - so I would likely end up leaving after the next year or two anyway. But I do worry I will be worse off finding a job when I return.

I’m starting to appreciate more the happy life I have at home - this comfy job - a great group of friends - festivals, weekends trips and holidays - being around family - my flourishing new relationship. At the moment the only thing that makes me feel better is the thought of coming home and everything being the same, but I’m worried everything is going to change.

On the other hand, I think a couple months long distance should not mean the end of a relationship. We plan to spend our lives together, so in the grand scheme of things it is a very short time. I should not give up this dream because of my fears that might not even come true. I would be stupid to drop out my chance to do this and if I did, it would be a life regret. But if it meant the end of this relationship, or an unenjoyable trip at the cost of my job and thousands of pounds, that could be another huge regret. 

There’s also the aspect of massively letting down my friend if I don’t go, I would feel so awful to ruin her dreams too, she would have waited for my surgery for nothing.

I feel incredibly ungrateful to be able to do what many only dream of and not feel excited about it. Ultimately I now feel fear instead of excitement. It makes it so difficult to muster up the energy and motivation to plan or buy anything I need to go ahead with it.

I don’t know if it’s worth the turmoil of quitting my job and putting a strain on my new relationship, when I’m not even sure I’m going to be able to enjoy it now. Is this just pre travel jitters now the trip is becoming real? Maybe I should just take the month and see how it goes?

I don’t think people tend to regret travelling? Many have told me go for it, and people that have gone have told me it’s the best thing they ever did, but they were not in relationships. 

Some days I feel so positive and excited about it, like the best case scenario is entirely possible, but usually that only lasts a few hours before the scaries come creeping back. 

Am I letting my anxieties get the better of me? Are these normal feelings before a trip? Or is this a sign this is not for me? Do I just go ahead and do it scared sh*tless? Or is that a recipe for disaster? Am I completely overthinking everything because in reality we’re specs on a massive floating rock in outer space? Probably?!

backpacking,"Spent two nights at a backpack site at Split Rock State Park on the north shore of Lake Superior. On our first full day a winter storm warning was issued and we got to watch the storm come in from the south. It was beautiful, but a couple hours into the storm the high wind off the lake and heavy snow were making it too difficult to maintain the fire so we went inside the tent and played cards until we fell asleep. We woke up the next morning with about a foot of snow surrounding our tent with the storm still raging. The storm then waited until we were close to being ready to hike out to really pick up and we were battered by 30-40mph wind gusts coming off the lake. After a tough hike back to the car pulling sleds through high snow drifts and deep snow we made it back to the car relieved to see a park employee had been plowing non-stop. He let us know the highway was almost un-drivable with white out snow conditions and unplowed drifts over a foot or two on the roads. He wasn’t lying and the drive was terrifying. I wouldn’t change this trip for the world and feel so much gratitude to be able to have experienced that storm in such a remote place.

backpacking,"BLUF; this year I attempted and failed to get an early access reservation on Recreation.gov for wilderness backpacking around Rainier. Of course, it came with a $6 fee just to apply that I'm learning is nonrefundable. 

$6 is not much, and I don't even care about the money. What gets me is that you're literally gambling to get the chance to pay more money to do something wholesome like backcountry camping. Add to that the fact that the lottery application fee goes straight to the private contractor that redesigned recreation.gov and it leaves a really bitter taste in my mouth. I would gladly let the parks department keep that money since they're pitifully funded as-is. 

I understand there's a lawsuit about this - maybe something will come of it. 

https://www.rvtravel.com/federal-lawsuit-seeks-halt-and-restitution-of-wrongful-fees-charged-by-recreationgov-rvt-1093b/

In the end, I just think the system could be designed better. Either give the lottery fees directly to the parks dept., refund the lottery fees for applicants that aren't successful or apply the fee to the base cost of a permit (i.e. permit minus the six dollar application fee). Any of these options would make me feel better. 

At the end of the day, it just feels like a big F U to people who really enjoy the outdoors when you're basically paying some shady third party KTR to be considered for the chance use public land. Stings worse when you're turned away and they keep your money. 

I'll still try other ways to access Rainier, it'll just be harder. Crossing my fingers that my North Cascades lottery application is accepted.

backpacking,"My partner is 34, turning 35 this year. It was always his dream to visit Australia and New Zealand, and some new WHV visa changes with the UK means that we can actually both go now. 

Both countries differ slightly in their conditions and allowances.  From what I can see;

In Australia (once the changes come into effect), you can apply up to the day before your 36th birthday, then have a year to enter (so just before your 37th birthday in theory).You can apply for year 2 or 3 as well, providing you are not over 35 when applying. Under these rules, we can get my partner a stay of 1 year. 

In New Zealand, you can also apply up to 35 now. This arrangement has been finalised and will be in effect by July this year. Unlike Australia, you can apply for a 23 month WHV right off the bat, guaranteeing my partner and myself almost 2 years instead of one. From what I understand, you can also extend this to 3 years after 23 months, provided you’re extending your current WHV. The extension doesn’t seem age based unlike Australia, but rather location based (you must be in NZ on a WHV when applying for the extension). Unlike Australia, if your WHV expires, you can’t leave and come back for another year with a new application. 

Having a base in NZ for 3 years would be amazing, and we can apply for it much sooner than the AUS one. Would it be okay to do that, but travel to Australia for a working holiday break while based in NZ on their WHV scheme? As 2 different countries I don’t imagine our visas for one would affect the other, and surely other working holiday makers have visited both on their trips. I know you can comfortably leave both and re-enter on your visa no problem, so as far as I can see we should be ok. 

As my partner is almost 35, that limits us in travel opportunities in a way the WHV is just perfect for. The NZ option would allow us to enter when he’s almost 37 and stay until he’s almost 40. But we’d also like to take hop over to Australia and do some travel/ casual work there.

Do you think this is possible? If not, why not?

The only thing I can imagine is that if we leave for a whole year, it might be an issue. Neither visas require us to do any farm work either.",Can you hold a WHV for both Australia and New Zealand at the same time?

I have until March 27 to confirm which city I'm going to. I'm going to Japan (solo traveler) at the beginning of June and I'll spend two months there, I'll share some information about myself here, so if more experienced people could advise me better.

My job will be working on a laptop (3 to 7 hours a day), I will have 8000e for expenses (I already bought the plane ticket). If absolutely necessary, this number will be exceeded, but I hope I won't have to do that.  
I'm not a fan of crowds, I'd like to spend my free time walking through villages, small towns, looking at houses (not buildings), outside urban and noisy places, I love long walks. I'm not a fan of excessive temperatures either, I like rain, I like winter, I like gloomy skies.  
I plan to visit other cities as a tourist, but I want the destination where I will live to be peaceful.

I don't know what else to share about myself, if you have any questions please ask and thank you very much for any advice.

I actually walked with a cane for awhile and have worked hard in therapy for a few years to be able to drop the cane and get back to doing the activities I love.  I also have an illness that causes me to experience pain in my legs which is typically more intense at night as well as lymphedema (swelling) in both of my legs. 

I currently have an older Nemo pad…I’m unsure of exact model but it’s only about 2 inches thick. I did a trial run in my yard and woke up hurting horribly and had limited use of my arm and hands and increased leg pain for about a week after. So that pad is definitely not going to do it for me. 

Hammocks are out for me because I have trouble getting in and out of them and I also have a ton of trouble hanging them because of my physical disabilities. 

I’m currently looking at getting a Sea to Summit Ether Light XT since it’s 4 inches thick. It seems to be well rated by people who say they have back problems and also by side sleepers.

I am an American living in Europe. There is no shortage of beautiful mountains here, but I am missing the wildness of back home. What I'd really like to find is an area where I can hike and sleep in my tent, preferably with as few other people as possible ... no offense :)

 I hiked the GR20 in Corsica last summer - it was really beautiful, but the areas where we could camp were always completely packed, with lines for the bathrooms, or to fill up water, etc. So I'm hoping to find something not quite so crowded.

Other possibilities I've heard of are the Kungsleden in Sweden, or the West Highland Way in Scotland, or Laugavegur in Iceland. I think there are plenty more GRs in France where camping is allowed - but if someone can confirm that, or recommend relatively untravelled favorites, that would be awesome.

Just curious if; 

1) Is two weeks enough for Mozambique? I'm particularly interested in diving, hiking, would like to go off the beaten path a little and also take in the culture there. 

2) If you've been to Mozambique, did you get to meet a lot of other backpackers/go on adventures with them? This is not the sole purpose of me travelling there but would be a bonus for sure

3) Anything you may particularly recommend doing that may have been the highlight for you?

1. Free Walking Tour:  
 Free walking tours in Paris are a great way to explore the city and learn about its history, culture, and landmarks without spending any money. These tours are typically led by knowledgeable and passionate local guides who provide an in-depth look at the city's most famous sights and hidden gems. They are generally offered on a ""pay-what-you-like"" basis, which means you can decide how much to tip your guide at the end of the tour based on your experience.  
 The tours usually cover famous areas such as the Marais, Montmartre, the Latin Quarter, and the Champs-Élysées. They often start at a central location, such as Notre Dame Cathedral or the Louvre Museum, and take you on a journey through the city's streets, squares, and landmarks. You will learn about the history of Paris, including the city's architecture, art, its culture, and famous figures.  
 Some free walking tours in Paris also offer themed tours, such as a food tour, a literary tour, or a ghost tour. These are a great way to delve deeper into a specific aspect of the city's culture.  
 
2. Visit the Museums  
 Many of Paris' most famous museums offer free admission at certain times or on specific days of the week. Museums like The Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, and Centre Pompidou offer free admission for everyone under the age of 18 and for EU citizens and residents under the age of 26. They offer completely free admission on the first Sunday of every month from October to March to everyone.  
 Another great way to visit Paris museums for free is by visiting the city's many smaller museums. Many of these museums are lesser known but just as exciting and informative as the larger ones. Some examples include the Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, the Musée des Arts et Métiers, and the Musée national des Arts asiatiques Guimet.  
 Even if you are not eligible for free admission, many museums offer discounted tickets for students, seniors, and other groups. It's also a good idea to check the museum's website or contact them in advance to confirm the free admission hours and days.  
 
3. See the Eiffel Tower Sparkle at Night  
 The view of the sparkling Eiffel tower is magical and you can see it for free. During the illumination hours, the lights are turned on for five minutes every hour, from sunset until 1 am. You can also see the tower from several places in the city, such as the Trocadero or the Champ de Mars. These places offer great views of the tower and the light show. You can also take a walk along the Seine River bank and enjoy the view of the tower from a distance.  
 You can also see the Eiffel Tower sparkle for free by visiting the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont. This park is located in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, and from the top of the hill, you can get a great view of the Eiffel Tower. It is lovely during the illumination hours and a great spot to enjoy a picnic while taking in the view.  
 Visiting the Eiffel Tower during the day is free, but you have to pay to go to the top or take the elevator. However, you can still see the tower and take pictures from the base and the surrounding area.  
 
4. Attend a Free Concert  
Attending free concerts in Paris is a great way to experience the city's vibrant music scene without breaking the bank. Paris has a rich musical heritage and a variety of venues that offer free concerts throughout the year.  
One of the best places to attend free concerts is at the Philharmonie de Paris. The Philharmonie is a modern concert hall located in the Parc de la Villette and offers free concerts regularly. These concerts feature a wide range of music, from classical to jazz, and are open to the public.  
Parisian churches also have recitals often that you can attend for free. Churches like Notre Dame Cathedral have Gregorian Chant on Sunday morning, St. Eustache church has free organ recital on Sundays from 5:30PM and so on. L'Officiel des Spectacles, which comes out every Wednesday has concert listings that always include free concerts, and the venues change from week to week.  
 
5. Free gardens in Paris:  
Paris is home to many beautiful gardens that offer free admission. With plenty of green spaces, fountains, and sculptures to admire, they're the perfect place to relax and soak in the Parisian atmosphere. Bring your picnic blanket and some French Baguette and cheese, and voilà! You got yourself a romantic Parisian picnic.  
 Luxembourg Garden, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, Parc Montsouris, Bois de Vincennes, and Bois de Boulogne are some of the most beautiful parks you can visit for free.

Hi!

I am reading from April you will be forced to have a guide in Nepal for trekking.

We are 2 months into travelling and are heading to Nepal early April to do AC. We were looking forward to doing this at our own pace and only really needed a guide for the pass. 

Does anyone know how this will be enforced or what to do? We cannot afford to budget for a guide on this trek for the time we wanted to take and I am with many other travellers who feel the same.

backpacking,"Hey guys/girls, 

I am new to Reddit so I don't know about how this works. Let's say I am a big picky person and before making a purchase I tend to overanalyze what I want and what I need. I wanted a big backpack for **college (Architecture**) that could fit all my stuff: **laptop, iPad, wires, pouch with craft tools (knife, tape, glue), mouse, an A5 sketchbook, and a few everyday essentials such as hand cream, wallet, earbuds, etc...** Since I wanted to carry so much stuff I opted for a 28L to 30L (approx) backpack. I liked the idea of a separated pocket for my laptop and fell in love with the commodity of the arness &amp; back cushioned support of the North Face Borealis. I also chose this bag for the aesthetics. 

I had this backpack for a few weeks and there are some flaws that made me want to change to a new one:

1st. The look of the bag when packed. I noticed that even if I put just my notebook and a few pencils in the small pocket with organizers in the front, this part of the back tends to project over the bottom, giving the bag a really weird shape. It happens independently if the bag is lightly or fully packed.

(I put a link of a girl in TikTok with the same problem)

2n. Even if I use poches to store my goodies, these end up badly pilled up and makes impossible to access something from the bottom without taking all the other pouches out. 

Considering this, I was looking for other backpacks that will overcome this flaws, but I need some advice. 

I like the look of the *Patagonia Black Hole 32l*, but it doesn't look sturdy but too flexible and I'm worried my laptop could be damaged and also that it wont be as comfortable as the Borealis when carrying it.

I like the organization options of the *Osprey backpacks (Tropos, Nebula)*... but I'm not sure if I really like the aesthetics of the design.

Then, I finally considered buying a clamshell like backpack, thus it would be easier to access every thing I need without the necessity of taking out all other stuff.

I will be so glad if you could give me some ideas of backpacks that would fit my demands and why they will. 

Ohh!! I'm buying the new bag from Spain, so shipping to this country should be available (and cheap :) ). 

Thanks!!!!

backpacking,"Hello /r/backpacking 

As the title says I'm planning to travel the world in only 2.5 weeks and still need a backpack fit for my needs. The plan is to only take a 40L backpack with me so I can fly comfortably with only hand luggage.
  
I also plan to take my MBP 2019 16' with me and maybe a little digital camera, so I need a backpack fit for digital nomads. I heard a ton of good things about the Nomatic (Gomatic) 40L travel bag but also quite a few bad things so I'm unsure if it's the right choice. 

I plan to travel SEA (Japan, S. Korea, China + HK, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, maybe Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines), Australia/NZ, and the whole of LATAM and maybe Canada at the end. I'll be mainly staying in hostels in cities but there is also a high possibility for me to be staying in a tent on some days when going to hike for multiple days. I also plan to travel whole countries by bus if possible and if not by airplane or ferry.  
  
I do like the idea of having a system like the Nomatic travel bag with a separate laundry bag and all the things separated as I'm a rather chaotic person. I'm 176cm, about 65kg if that helps. 

Things I need to pack are roughly those mentioned: 

- Shirts
- At least one hoodie
- At least one pair of long pants and two shorter ones
- Slim but warm jacket for cold days (start temperature will be around 0-10 degrees celsius)
- Underwear
- Maybe a smaller bag for daily activities
- Shoes for hiking
- MacBook Pro 2019 16' 
- Cables for phone and MBP 
- Hygiene stuff and drugs for emergencies
- Medication I need to take 
- Documents   
  
That's the rough list of things I need to have with me.   
  
I'll be travelling for approx. 1 year but it can extend to up to 2.5 years.

backpacking,"**You can visit free places and they are all amazing. You don’t have to sacrifice fun for money.**

If you want to watch it as a video, visit the link in my profile. I have a youtube channel.

1. **Explore Ko Kret Island**

Ko kret is an artificial island in Chao Phraya River, just northwest of central Bangkok city. It is equipped with everything one needs to be entertained in a low budget.

You can go there any day of the week but the weekends are spectacular when many vendors sell food, local pottery, and various random things. Although you wanna keep it within a budget, it is for sure that you’ll spend more money on some mouth watering food and beautiful looking pots. You can plan to spend an entire day in there if your stay in Bangkok is long enough, but you can also get around the island within 5 to 6 hours if you want to keep it short.

If you have enough time, I recommend you to visit the other parts of the island as well. You never know what you’ll come across. It’s less visited than the main market, so it’s peaceful and a way to directly mingle with the local people and experience their day to day lives.

Only way of reaching Ko kret is through boats which you can get from Nonthaburi Pier. You pass through beautiful Wat Sanam Nuea temple to get to the Pier. Ride is almost 15 to 20 minutes and it will cost you maximum of 5 bhats, it’s incredibly cheap if you convert it to USD, like 15 cents.

**2. Get lost at the Chatuchak Weekend Market**

It is one of the largest market in Asia, the biggest in Thailand. It has more than 15000 stalls, just imagine how big it is. Either you wanna spend tons of money on shopping, or you wanna kill time but see Thai culture without spending a dime, for both things it can be your go to place.

The whole market is open from 9am to 6pm on weekends. On other days it’s partially open. You can find everything from plants, antiques, consumer electronics, cosmetics, fresh and dry food and drinks, ceramics, anything you can think about. There are wholesalers and retailers for almost every items and the best thing is, they ship directly to your address. They charge you an extra shipping fee, but you don’t have to bother carrying bags for the whole day, right?

Their street foods are fantastic. Try as many street foods as you can. they are cheap and also give the authentic local taste of Thailand.

You can get here by train, taxi, metro, Tuk tuk; it’s famous locally, it’s like an Auto, or by bus. There’s a website that explains in detail about how to get there, it’s mentioned in the description below, make sure to check it.

Some more tips while visiting the market; try to start the visit early in the morning because it’s gonna be crowded during the mid-day. Also wear comfy clothes as you have to walk through the market, probably all day. Get some cash and remember to bargain. Although the prices are already cheap, you can get them for around 70% to 80% less than the marked price. Also be safe of thieves as it is a crowded place, and keep your belongings safe.

**3. Visit the Erawan Shrine**

Erawan shrine also called ‘Thao Maha Prom Shrine’ is a statue of Phra Phrom, it’s the Thai representation of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. It shows the relationship between Hinduism and Buddhism. Thai people regard it as their guardian spirit.

It’s located at the Grand Hayatt Erawan Hotel at Ratchaprasong intersection. It’s a busy place just next to shopping malls. The smell of the incense sticks, music, and beautiful flowers makes the place feel very serene.

You can visit it any-day from 6am to 11pm, free of cost. You can just pray on your own or hire Thai dancers to accompany your prayer for an extra cost.

Although Erawan is the most visited one, There are five other shrines in the area if you wanna visit them as well. You can tour them all in one visit.

**4. Relax in a park**

Bangkok may be a bustling metropolis, but it's also home to some beautiful parks. There are many parks where you can wander around. Lumphini Park, Benjakitti Park, Queen Sirikit Park, King Rama IX Park, and Rommaninat Park are the most famous parks of all. They are a great place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. It's a popular spot for locals to relax, play sports, and enjoy the scenery. So when you get there, you can meet with the locals and enjoy with them.

You can even rent a paddle boat and take a leisurely tour of many parks’ lakes. And if you're feeling competitive, join in on a game of takraw, it’s a traditional Thai sport similar to volleyball, with the local people. But be warned, they're pretty good at that.

**5. Visit Bangkok Art and Culture Center**

If you need some AC during the mid day, given how hot Thailand is, it’s the perfect place to go. Also if you love some art, you can visit here. It is located only a few minutes walk from National Stadium BTS Skytrain metro Station. just get off at the station and it’s easily accessible.

It has a modern building with shops and galleries surrounding a central atrium. It looks like a shopping mall when you enter the building. On the lower floor you’ll find private galleries, boutiques and coffee shops. Upstairs you can explore exhibitions from some of Thailand’s best and brightest artists along with art by famous foreign artists.

It is open from 10am to 9pm and closed on Mondays and yes its free. It is a good location to put on your itinerary and you can plan to spend around 2 to 3 hrs in there.",Free Things to do in Bangkok,,cheaptravelbuddy1,,0,2023-03-07 02:16:59

backpacking,"Hey r/backpacking!

Pretty much as the title says. I'm looking for like-minded adventure travellers to start a random travel club. Over the past year, I got a liiiiiiitle bit obsessed with some tools I found to generate random destinations for travel. (Not sure if I can post links so I will leave them out for now.) I've been doing imaginary random travel draws for a while now and almost all of them yielded interesting results in some way or another.

The idea of the club would be to pick one set of random coordinates per year (I've come up with several methodologies but won't bore you with that yet!) and all members will try to get there independently at some point over the course of the year - maybe post a selfie from the official spot, share some stories of getting there, post travel pictures from that country/region for a year, really immerse ourselves in that place's travel riches for a year.

Maybe this will get zero traction but I'm hoping at least a few people out there are curious about this as one way to explore the world.

By way of example, I did a soft launch this year with just my family and a few friends. We drew San Marino, coordinates: 43.9422, 12.4637 so we made our official destination a nearby gelateria called Altro Gelato. We're going to tie it into a larger Italy trip this summer!

backpacking,"Hey fellow Redditors!

I recently came back from an epic backpacking trip around Asia, and let me tell you, it was incredible! The food, the culture, the scenery - it was all amazing. But there was one thing that kept bugging me throughout my travels: internet censorship.

Whether it was trying to access my favorite streaming services or staying in touch with my friends and family back home, it seemed like every country had its own set of online restrictions. That's when I decided to try out a VPN - and it was a game-changer.

If you're a fellow traveler, or even just someone who cares about online privacy and security, here are five reasons why you need a VPN in your life:

1. Access Your Favorite Websites Anywhere: With a VPN, you can bypass internet censorship and access any website or service you want, no matter where you are. Whether you're trying to watch Netflix in a country where it's blocked or accessing a social media platform that's banned, a VPN will get you there.
2. Stay Safe on Public Wi-Fi: We've all been there - you're at a coffee shop or airport, and the only available Wi-Fi network is unsecured. With a VPN, you can encrypt your internet connection and protect yourself from hackers and other online threats.
3. Get Better Deals on Flights and Hotels: Did you know that some airlines and hotels offer different prices based on your location? By using a VPN to change your location, you can find better deals and save money on your travels.
4. Avoid Geo-Restrictions: Certain content, like TV shows and movies, are only available in certain regions. With a VPN, you can change your virtual location and access that content no matter where you are in the world.
5. Protect Your Privacy: Finally, using a VPN is a great way to protect your online privacy. By masking your online activity and location, you can avoid targeted ads and other invasive practices that compromise your privacy.

So there you have it - five great reasons to start using a VPN today. Trust me, it'll make your travels (and online life in general) so much easier and more secure. I found this [**Community Website**](https://www.vpngrades.com) on Reddit with that latest discount codes from different providers.

WHY?: In 2011 I hiked the Via Francigena from Canterbury to Rome. Back then, the directions I had gave a distance and then the next direction. For example, ""...turn right onto a dirt road - 1.2km - veer to the right at the big tree - 200 m - turn left up the hill..."" It was like I was following an old treasure map. Back then I used a pedometer that I could reset at will. I am setting off on the Via Francigena again. I don't believe the ""trail"" is well-marked. There is an app that shows the route on Maps, but I don't want to have to look at my phone any more than is necessary. I'd like to follow the directions I had last time. 

Every watch I've looked at resets automatically at midnight but lacks the ability to reset at will. In my perfect world, I can look at my watch to see how far I have traveled. Push a button to reset that distance to zero, and then move on to the next waypoint. 

Does such a watch (or possibly other devices) exist that does that?

Hello everyone, I am new to backpacking and planning to do a backpacking trip on the TNB. Having to do this trip in April due to scheduling conflicts and time constraints and I am pretty much a beginner when it comes to backpacking. Feeling over whelmed with the research. Any advice you guys can give me? Starting the beginning stages of planning and just want to hear from experienced backpackers or experiences from people who have done the tour. Thank you in advance! 

A few questions I have: 
Can we camp anywhere on the paths/trails?

I've done Rainier and a bunch of 14ers so I'm good with snow travel but I just want to be sure because some friends of mine are coming with. Some with experience and some without. If there is snow still would we need crampons/axe or could we get by with boots or boots/microspikes?

I'm going on a weeklong hike in a few weeks. It sounds like we'll have a few river crossings, and I'd like to have a way to store socks so that I know they'll stay dry even if my backpack goes for a swim. It's also quite likely that we'll be hiking in the rain for a day or two, so it'd be nice to have a pair of dry socks that I can break out as a last resort. It would also save quite a bit of space in my pack.

5d/4n
The hardest cycle so far. 
Nouakchott to Atar (460km)
I left Nouakchott and cycled straight into NE headwind blowing faster than I could pedal for 2.5 days straight. To give some insight, I had wind gusts of 58KPH from NE/ENE; I cycle at 20KPH... Yes, every KM felt like double. The temperature was 35-40°C, and I experienced 2 full days of sandstorms. I later came to learn that the wind I was experiencing would carry dust across the Atlantic Ocean and turn the skies of SE USA red, the wind is known as La Calima. 
I slept in the wild for 3n, and in an Army (Gendarmerie) compound for 1n.

DAY 1: 
Nouakchott NE (90km)
The first day I had been warned about the headwind and sandstorms by a fellow cyclist, and friend - Raymond Lee over a pre-departure coffee. But, as I had no previous solid experience on to base these warnings, I left unaware of what lay ahead. I began cycling at 9 am and left the city by 10:30 am. The desert sand consumed the horizon with small, undulating dunes spotted around. At this stage, there were small settlements of 2-6 houses sprawled throughout the dunes. 
After 4 hours of riding, I ran out of water. I had only left with 4.5L (3x1.5L bottles), and (to this day I question whether it was correct), I gave a full 1.5L bottle to a group of men beside the road. So there I was, 4 hours into my ride, heat beginning to set in, no human life for 360° around me, and out of water. 
I was saved by a passing motorist who gave me a .75L bottle and a Baguette, which was enough to get me to a random house with a Water Pillow. I had heard of these pillows, they're usually Orange and rectangular. Inside is potable water accessed by spearing a balloon-like end at the top with a pipe, and then siphoning the water out. I filled my (now) 4x bottles and continued. 
At 50km from Nouakchott, the wind began whipping sand, and became near impossible to continue cycling, so I sought refuge in a Radio Tower. I was surprised to see a lone worker asleep in a makeshift hut at the base of the tower, he awoke as I entered and immediately offered me tea and a piece of foam to sit on. We spoke broken French until the wind subsided, and I continued for a further 20km until again, I was low on water. This time, I managed to find a Water Pillow with relative ease and walked over to fill my water. As I knelt beside the pillow, I was met with an odd situation. A large African woman appeared and questioned me - ""You are Muslim?"", I politely said no. She became exasperated and aggressively started talking in French, I didn't get a good feeling, so began walking back to my bike with empty bottles. 
At this point, a beat-up Mercedes van was passing by, he must've guessed the situation and stopped. The motorist's name was Mohammed-Ji and grabbed a full 10L water tank from his van to fill my bottles, he also gave me some biscuits. 
I cycled a further 20km until the sun began setting and the blue sky gave way to purple. I spotted a group of dunes amongst the vast pancake plateau, they were about 400m off the road and offered 270° protection from the wind. 
I erected my tent behind the dunes, and beside the ominous sight of a decomposed camel carcass. 

Taken from my Journal - 
""Today was tough. No villages or shops from Nouakchott (90km), Very Hot, No Shade. The environment is deathly, People's kindness was the only respite.""
""Desert Distance is confusing. There are no landmarks or changes in scenery. 100KM is not measured by towns passed, as there are simply none. Instead, the only constant is Pedal Stroke. It is hypnotic and mind-emptying.""
""This is an alien land, not made for Humans. Nothing grows, you can't help but worry - about water, food, shade - you can't relax.""
""Desert Nights are the stage for Dreams. The temperature drops and darkness covers the barren landscape... it allows you to lucidly dream, to pretend you're somewhere else; only bound by your imagination.""

DAY 2:
90KM to 165KM (75KM)
Waking up on the cool sand, and being covered by the emerging Sun behind hugging dunes allowed me to ease into the 2nd day. However, as soon as I exited the tent and my head was exposed over the dunes, I felt the wind - stronger than yesterday. I packed my tent quickly. 
I backed into the wind to boil some oats for breakfast; at that moment of hunger, I realized that I did not have a lighter to ignite my Gas Stove. My mind was working in overdrive and I didn't even allow doubt to enter, I opened the Gas valve to Full, and sparked my flint rod. After 3 false sparks, I managed to shoot a spark into the jet and ignite the flame. I boiled water for 2min until lukewarm to conserve my Gas, this made for an average breakfast. 
Today was noticeably more difficult. The wind was stronger, the sand was blinding (my sunglasses fell off my hat whilst cycling out of Auberge Samira in Nouakchott), my nutrition was minimal, and I was feeling lonely. 
I managed to find a home within my mind whilst moving. I didn't think, I didn't move my eyes - I just cycled hypnotic for 6 hours. I stopped when I found the first shade I had seen since morning, it was a shrub, and it was a bed. I slept under that Bush for 1hr before cycling a further 30 mins. It was then that I found a small Service Station, the first resupply point in 2 days. I bought 4x1L bottles of water (9.25L total NOW), Chocolate, and Sardines. I sat at the lonely station; a lonely man. Whilst there, I looked to the sky and was surprised to see a passing Contrail from an aircraft above, I remember thinking - ""I would do anything to be in that plane"".
After a slump of feeling weak, the sugar filled my veins with enough energy to push on a further 20km to a hamlet called Al-Asam. Whilst passing through, I was invited for tea by a local man and was gifted with biscuits for the road. I asked where the next town was and he said ""80KM - Akjoujt"". 
By this stage, it was 4 pm (it gets dark at 7 pm) - I made peace with cycling through the night. I decided to push a further 80km to Akjoujt. By 6 pm, I had managed 18km and my body was weary. I heard a voice from behind a shrub and noticed a lone man sitting on a rug beside his car. He called me over for tea, I learned his name was Sidi-Mohammed, a mining engineer of some sort that worked in Akjoujt. Whilst sitting with him, he revealed a large silver bowl - inside was a Mighty portion of Rice, Beans, and Goat Leg. It was a gift from above. 
We ate and chatted (he spoke English) for 45 mins before he explained that he needed to get to Akjoujt. When I think back, that man had a Toyota Hilux with an empty tray, I could've put my bike in it, and I'm sure he would've agreed... for some reason, I didn't ask. Before he left, he offered me 200 OUG (AUD 8). I declined and yelled ""your friendship costs more than that"" - he drove away smiling, and I cycled away lonely, fatigued, and concerned about finding a camp spot. 
I spotted the largest shrub on the horizon and cycled across the soft sand toward it. It provided me 180° protection from the wind, I erected my tent in the dark and began sparking my flint into the Gas Stove. Immediately I got a flame, I began boiling Raw Lentils for not long enough. I mixed them with a tin of Sardines and ate crunchy, difficult-to-digest beans with warm canned fish, at least I was eating. I slept deeply. 
Taken from my Journal - 
""Today, the horizon is impaired by shifting sands, blowing faster than I can cycle. This is the most miserable I have ever felt. Why am I doing this? I want Coastlines &amp; Waves, instead, I chose cycling head-first into a Desert.""
""Sand and Dust everywhere. I haven't showered in 3 days, and each time I stop for a rest, a swarm of flies attacks. Every little thing is irritating me. I want to get out of Mauritania.""
""I could've asked Sidi-Mohammed for a lift. But this is my Guilty Pleasure, I enjoy this struggle.""

DAY 3:
165KM to Akjoujt
Woke up at 3 am - wet. I had lost Bladder Control through the night due to fatigue, and the amount of water I'd been consuming (roughly 12L). I sat up to wash myself off and felt wet on my face, I wiped away the moisture to find blood dripping from my nose and dried under my eyelids, forehead, and cheek. This was the point I realized that the human mind is stronger than our body. My mind would've pushed my body to Total Shutdown if it wasn't for this reminder. 
I sat awake from 3 am until the sun rose, breathing deeply, drinking water, and stretching. In that moment of chaos, I noticed everything was peaceful and heavenly. 
There was no moon visible, therefore the stars had a chance to shimmer and show their subtle beauty without the spotlight from the moon.
The stars slowly bid farewell and the sun rose, I packed my tent away in habitual fashion and got to preparing Breakfast. I knew today was a Big push to Akjoujt, I was aware that my body might not be up for it either, so I got the final Coffee I had left - I needed all the help I could get. One thing about cooking with 1 pot, is the mixture of ingredients... I can't boil my oats AND boil a coffee... so, coffee-infused Oats it was. It did not taste good, but at this stage, I was eating for Nutrition, not for taste. 
The cycle today was the toughest day out of 5d. I managed 90km into the most Direct Headwind so far, it took me a complete Sun-cycle, I began at Sunrise and arrived at Sunset. 
Along the way, I ran close to emptying my water 2xtimes. The final time happened 20km outside of Akjoujt when I had a choice to make - Risk being stranded overnight with no water, or remain here (it was getting dark) and seek help, I chose to continue and was blessed with a left-hand turn taking me away from my Northeast heading and toward a Northerly heading. This directional change brought me away from Headwind for the final 20km and allowed me to make the final 20km in 1 hour. 
As I neared Akjoujt, flat desert plains gave rise to mountains and canyons. The sun seeped below the horizon and the sky lit up in deep pink and purple - Apocalyptic. 
I passed a Military Checkpoint at the entrance of the town border and handed over my Passport and Fiche (itinerary). After 2mins I was waved into the town which for 3d had represented an Oasis for me, an opportunity to find a bed, charge my electronics, and resupply food... this was not the case. 
I rode into the center of town in the dark to the tune of the Call to Prayer. The village looked reminiscent of a Pakistani/Afghan village - dilapidated mud-brick homes, donkey carts tied to fences, and men in groups on street corners. I knew I was 1 conversation away from Friend or Foe - I just got that feeling. 
I cycled to a sign that looked like ""Hotel"" and noticed 2 young Pakistani men out the front. I asked whether a room was available, to which they said no. However, they knew someone in town who might have a room and called him. I waited 20mins with the 2 men for their friend to arrive on a Bicycle. By the time he arrived, fatigue had settled into my veins and I was tired, also, a group of 20 street kids and men had circled what likely was the only white man in the village. 
The hotel owner and I exchanged what we thought were fair prices on the street, and in front of the crowd. When we did not reach an agreement, the crowd became vocal and adamant that I was being disrespectful (I countered his €40 for 1n, with €10). I was frustrated, fatigued, and no longer scared of the outcome. 
I smiled at the Hotel Owner and extended my hand to shake his, as his hand fell into mine, I pushed my thumb into the soft flesh of his upper palm with all the force I could. I didn't release my grip, and said very clearly ""I will leave now"". Afterward, I slowly released my grip and began cycling out of town, I got 100m until I realized this guy was following me. I planned to cycle to a group of elderly men and play the victim to get help - I struck Gold. 
After a 500m passive chase (cue the ""Benny Hill Theme Song""), I noticed a 3m high barb-wired fence compound that belonged to the Gendarmerie. Out the front were 5 soldiers, I cycled to them and asked for a place to pitch my tent in their compound as I felt unsafe being followed by this Hotel Owner. They looked at me (took pity on me), and shooed off the pesty follower. One soldier, in particular, Moctar, took to me. He explained that he was the Captain and that I could camp behind his home which he shared with 2 other soldiers. 
We walked over to his place, I pitched my tent, and then Moctar asked if I wanted a shower - my first shower in 4 days. Admittedly, it was a tiled floor with a hole drilled for a drain, and water contained in a Jam bucket... but it felt like a cleanse. I washed an inch of sand from my skin, it was so thick that my tattoos were covered. 
After a shower, I came out to the sitting room where yellow cracked bricks walled the house, soldiers lay sprawled on dirty mats, and a TV thicker than it was wide commanded the attention of all in the room. That night, 3 Gendarmerie soldiers and I drank tea, watched a FIFA WC 2018 replay of Portugal vs. Russia, and then plotted ways to obtain Australian visas for Mauritanian soldiers... I doubt a sponsorship letter from me will help, but the sentiment was appreciated. 
I slept that night safely and cleanly. 

DAY 4:
Akjoujt to 360km
I woke up after an interrupted sleep, I shared the gardens of the military compound with nocturnal Goats that found amusement with headbutting steel fences. Not only was my sleep interrupted by my environment, but I also woke up with a blocked nose - I blew outside of the tent and saw another thick ball of blood. 
Moctar had explained the previous night that the Compound gates opened at 7 am. So, I sat awake from 5-7 am chatting inside with the soldiers, exchanging FB, Gmails, WhatsApp, and, something I experienced Deja Vu from - watching the circling of Mecca on Islamic TV. That is something I so vividly remember from my time spent with Ed in Pangandaran, Indonesia when I was days away from an Indonesian wife, a Seafood Warung, and life in a beautiful Indonesian village. ""I wonder how Ed is?""
I grabbed a head-sized Brioche bun, a leg-sized Baguette, and 4 bananas from a shop opposite the military compound and began the cycle out of Akjoujt. 
I managed 20km over the most poorly-maintained stretch of road so far. I eventually opted for the compacted sand on the shoulder as the ankle-deep potholes were taking too much concentration to avoid. 
After 20km, I rounded a large mountain and was transported from the desert to arid Kyrgyzstan. Sand became soil, dunes became slopes, and stick huts became rug-walled Yurts.
Along the ride, I had an itching to climb one of these mountains. After an hour of searching for the ""right"" one, I decided on a 200m high Hill made up of craggy rock with a defined spine to traverse. I left my bike along the side of the road and began hiking up the hill, the feeling was unique. I was high enough to appreciate how far I had come, but in front of me revealed how far I still had to ride. The road ahead was long and straight, it stretched as far as the eye could see. Apart from the route forward, I was presented with dried riverbeds clearly defined by the shrubs growing amongst the moist soil, groups of Camels roaming the plains searching for food, and dotted camps of 3-4 tents at the base of large hills. 
That moment atop the mountain was my most joyful so far, I was away from the bike, away from the road, away from the suffering - and alone above the landscape. 
After descending the mountain, I continued cycling until I was out of the mountainous valley and uncommon grassland, and back into the wind and heat of the Sandy Sahara. The following 50km was marked by unchanging sand and 2x Radio Towers. It was hell. 
The roads were so long, and so straight that it was possible to view as far as the eye could see into the horizon, and catch it 3/4 times in a day. It killed me emotionally and psychologically. 
Along this 50km stretch, I ran out of water. This situation was different from the others - there were NO settlements nearby and I hadn't seen a car for &gt;2hr. I was alone. My lips became so dry that 1 large scab formed that sealed my lips together. 
I decided to stop riding and wait. I created shade by leaning my bike against my back and draping a towel across the handlebars and over my head. Whilst waiting, I fell asleep and missed a passing car, I knew this because I saw the taillights in the distance. I was adamant about not letting this happen again and positioned myself on the road. Eventually, after 30mins a car full of Spanish-speaking Africans appeared and reluctantly gave me a bottle of water. 
I was grateful and hugged a man that looked as if he wanted to punch me. 
I continued a further 10km until again, I had run out of water. This time, a beat-up Mercedes sedan filled with a lively bunch of Arabic men swerved to stop for me, they handed me water, Chocolate, biscuits, and a photo. They left speeding, and so did I... That exchange sparked life into my veins. The ""Reckless Youth"" helps those in need. 
Third time in a row, I had only cycled a further 5km when another car stopped for me (when it rains, it pours?). A pair of wealthy Arabic men asked where I was from - ""Australia!"", they replied ""Ah, you're a long way from home - please take this"", they handed me 2x1L Water bottles and a Baguette. 
That stretch of desert was harsh, but gems were gifted to me.
As I was nearing the end of the day, I was passed by a German motorcyclist called Steffen. He was a young man of 30, riding from Germany to South Africa. He had recently come from Morocco to Nouakchott and then began riding NE toward Chinguetti. Steffen asked my plan, I told him I would catch the train from Choum to Nouadhibou and then cycle north through Morocco. His words were life-giving: ""so you are leaving Mauritania? Well, let me tell you - The Hardest Part Is Over"". 
After a great chat with foreigners in foreign lands, Steffen continued his big day of 700 km, and I continued my bigger day of 95 km. 
The final hours of today were the scariest. After 10hr of riding for the 4th day straight, as night descended...

NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE: 
I was playing mind games with myself trying to close my eyes for a few seconds and pretending to micro-sleep. The next thing I remember is waking up on the downward slope of the road in the sand. It was now dark so I must've been down there for about an hour. I thought I had died, I looked over my body and was covered in sand and twigs, my toes had been grazed between the pedals and the road (I wore TEVA sandals, so no cover) and my big toenail had ripped out so the closest part to my foot was higher than the outside. I had cuts and grazes on the right-hand side of my body. But, I felt no pain, so... In my state, I thought I had died and was in a lucid afterlife where I now had powers and could travel anywhere, like when you dream that you can fly? Do you know when you think if you run fast, you will take off? Anyway, I stood up and began walking away from the road alone into the desert, my mind was so empty but I was motivated. I must have got about 400m away from my bike and the road before I started feeling pain in my feet, the sight of sand covering layers of blood on my feet snapped me back into reality. 
I walked back to my bike, I remember sleeping beside my bike, about 2m lower than the road in a sandy ditch curled in a ball. In that moment, I felt this feeling of immense disappointment, like the easy option of waking up dead and free, was ripped from me. I was without water, aching in pain from bruising and stinging from dirty grazes, and throbbing pain from my toenails having to be removed by my leatherman - I remember having to leverage the back of my toenail forward and peeling it off. 
At that moment, living was harder than dying. 
I have never gotten over that moment in time, it's not a neurotic playback of suicidal thoughts, it feels like an extra half being added to an exhausting game. I believed that I woke up a ghost and was satisfied, then, almost like a mistake from the afterlife, they kicked me out and told me to keep going on earth. 

DAY 4 (continued) - 
Laying bloodied and confused, I realized that when you strip away everything and are left with nothing, you appreciate the little things so much more. My mind was a collage of laughing with family, things I'd say to old loves, and mostly alternate realities if I made different choices in the past.

Taken from my Journal -
""I HATE this cycle, I miss my family.""
""I feel de-motivated, exhausted, homesick, lonely, angry, disconnected, paralyzed, emotionally drained. If someone offered me an easy out; I'd take it.""
""I wonder how Ed is? I would give anything to be in the beautiful jungle of Indonesia right now.""
""Life is the difference between waking up or not, it's that simple"".

DAY 5:
360km to Atar
Last night the constellations were clearer and more real than my own hands. The flat sand was bleached by the moonlight into a Lunar landscape.
I woke up wet, again. My bladder had given up and I had pissed myself, and just as the previous 2n, I had a bloodied nose again. I also had a chance to properly look at my foot and realized how deep some of the Chain Cassette teeth had dug into my Achilles and forefoot.
Despite this, I woke up strong and overcome by a sense of imminent triumph. I knew all I had to do was cycle 85km to Atar, and then I could call my Mum, Brother, and Dad - the only things that kept me going. 
I had 5% left on my phone and treated myself to listening to music. I listened to my favorite Swedish song 4 times, and Kyle's song that makes me laugh is ""Spot the Difference"". I boiled my water till bubbling this morning and drank scorching water to spike some adrenaline, I even washed my pot after to re-use it for a separate pot of oats - there was an air of calm, enjoyment, and remembrance to Savour this final morning. 
The first 45km today was quick and easy. It reminded me of Thai cycling, I had no wind, smooth roads, and averaged 24KPH. I eventually found a roadside stall and quenched my thirst for a liquid other than water - I bought a melon drink, mango juice, and orange juice. I didn't even finish them, instead, a mouthful was enough. 
At 40km from Atar, I approached an Oasis town built around beautiful Palm trees, called Ain Ehel Taya. Cycling through the town I smiled at the playful children, curious men, and shy girls. I stopped at a market stall to buy 1kg of Tangerines, they had no seeds and could be eaten whole once peeled - they were as sweet as candy and devoured in minutes. 
Leaving this town, I had my first of a series of hill climbs toward Atar. This was a bad time to realize I had no Low Gear available. Instead, I had to climb in my lowest gear (4th) instead of 1. *I later learned that my gear cables had been stretched over time, and at that stage redundant. 
At 30km from Atar, I was rewarded with a 6km long switchback carved into red mountains. Despite the heat, days of exhaustion, sore feet, and high Gear setting - I raced up the mountains standing on the pedals and with a sprint finish a Racing Cyclist would be proud of. 
The final 20km was a long, drawn-out downhill that tracked North and was flanked on my East by high mountains, therefore I was completely covered by the wind. The downhill allowed me to roll the final stretch - it was over. 
One final military checkpoint and the next question - ""Where to mister?"" 
At each checkpoint, I had said ""Atar"", so when I arrived, they were expecting me. Now, I had to think of a new place... East to Chinguetti? Northeast to Ouadane? 
No, Thank-you.  ""Choum, where I will catch the train to Nouadhibou, Thank you.""
I cycled into Atar, consulted a couple of apps and WhatsApp groups with tips from other travelers, and decided on a cheap auberge to stay at - Camp Imini. 
Atar isn't why I was happy to arrive. No, the opportunity to call my Mum, Dad, and Brother was. As soon as I arrived; as soon as they answered - ""I love you.""

Taken from my Journal - 
""CHERISH EVERYTHING. Make everything into an event. Invite people to share an experience - however big, or small. Share an experience to create a memory.""
""Experiences are richer, and sweeter when shared.""
""I look back on 5d of solitude &amp; struggle. Every KM was bought with pain, effort &amp; willpower. I arrived with depleted levels of all - my body was failing. The only part of me that remained full, and in fact, grew? Love. Love for my family shone brighter today than day 1.""",The time I traveled solo on my bike across Mauritania and nearly DIED,,Ok-Pie-906,,6,2023-03-01 05:12:39

backpacking,"**Looking to upgrade my tent to a lighter-weight option but have gotten a little stuck on deciding between the following. They all seem like they could work, so I'm looking for any first-hand experience to help me narrow it down.** 

 **Here is some additional context:**

* Needs to be able to fit 2p. I'll often be solo but occasionally will bring my partner or close friend along (we're comfortable being shoulder-to-shoulder) -- I also already have a hammock for solo trips
* I split my time between upstate NY (ADK) and the broader Northeast as well as Northern New Mexico, Southern CO, and the Four Corners region. This means rain, snow, humidity, dry weather, and high winds are all in the forecast. 
* Average trip duration is 3-5 days
* I don't often go out when it's below 10-15F; but I do like to have something that I can potentially take on good-weather backcountry ski tours or on the occasional winter backpacking trip; so I guess something more 3+ season oriented
* Rain and condensation management are important, particularly in the Northeast where it is seemingly always damp and humid
* When in NM in particular there aren't always great options for staking so semi-freestanding or freestanding is ideal. This is what was most attractive about the TarpTent options. 
* Will be doing some longer trips next year (Long Trail in VT) and some segment hiking of the CDT this year
* I generally take quite good care of my gear but I don't want anything too brittle. I would like to have this tent last for at least a few years. 
* My pack is the Durston Kakwa 55L so I have plenty of space to work with; although I would like to minimize weight where possible; the only caveat is that weight savings seem to come at a pretty significant price increase. Is it worth it? 
* My REI dividend also just landed, so I'd be able to pick up the non-TarpTent options for a modest ""discount""

And as for the backpacking trip itself, I'm not looking to go too crazy - I'd like to do a three day trip that is ideally either a loop or an out and back (Good chance I'll have a rental car that I can just park at a trailhead, I hope?).  So any advice or resources on backpacking trips would be much appreciated, and if anyone has any must see must do's around Arizona I'm all ears for that as well.

backpacking,"I'm an experienced backpacker from Michigan and am going to be cabin camping one hour west of Denver at Reverend Ridge campground for four days. I'll be going with my 25 yo daughter who is also experienced.

I'm in great shape. I'm a SAR responder and have WFR cert. I've done plenty of summer mountain hiking (including near Estes Park). I've backpacked in snow. But I've never hiked through snow covered mountains. I'll be in Denver in March.

Since I've never been winter packing in the Rockies I figured I'd get a heated cabin for a Basecamp for my first time.

Anyway I'd like to get some recommendations for good day hikes within an hour-ish of where we're staying. If you guys know of any good spots that would be manageable in the winter I'd really appreciate it. 

Day 1 I'll be acclimating. Day 2 I want to do a moderate hike. Day 3 maybe a big hike with lunch on the trail above treeline if I'm adjusted to the altitude ok and the weather and avalanche conditions permit it. If not it would be good to have some lower altitude options.

Lakes, rivers, waterfalls would be great. 

I plan on packing snow shoes and ice cleats along with my normal loadout, and I have rented a Jeep Wrangler to handle the mountains.

I have experience hiking but obviously this is a huge feat and I have been known to get a bit lonely on solo travels. I normally alleviate it by distracting myself with other people's company at hostels, but I don't think I'll be doing that as often this time and will probably be spending a lot of time by myself, or at least not with anyone I'm super close with.

If you have any tips, advice, experience with overcoming loneliness or turning it into something better, I'd love to hear it.

backpacking,"Hi! Experienced backpacker here! I travelled the world solo for 7 years and here are my tips:

•	⁠world adapter. Get yourself a good compact one where you can plug in usbs AND any plugs. You never know when you might need to.
•	⁠good power bank. There will be times where you might be with no access to electricity I.e. overnight bus rides.
•	⁠unlocked phone. For me it was really handy to be able to just buy a sim in any country and have access to internet for whatever. It does come in handy when you need to translate text (google translate has a cámara option where it can translate text on the spot) or look for hostels or search for transport
•	⁠travel towel. Light, easy to dry, will prevent your backpack from smelling like a wet dog. Get a big one so it can also double up as a blanket if push comes to shove
•	⁠flip flops. You DO NOT want to shower barefoot in some of the hostels
•	⁠maps.me app. You can download a whole country/area and it can be used without internet though the gps will still work. I used to pin point my hostels and off I went!
•	⁠there are many credit cards that will give you 0% interest and give you a very good exchange rate. I don’t know where you are but research with your banks. Otherwise, a good rule of thumb is being able to have your main money separate from your everyday card in case it is stolen or whatnot.
•	⁠good, comfy walking shoes. You will be walking a lot! Probably averaging out 20-30k steps a day! I recommend sketchers. They’re the hug you never knew your feet needed.
•	⁠a medical bag. Nothing too extreme but some antihistamines (really helps with mosquito bites), antiseptic&amp;anaesthetic cream will come to your rescue to prevent infections on any minor cuts and grazes when you can’t wash your wound right away &amp; tummy upset medicine.
•	⁠jacket/waterproof jacket. Even if you’ll be going somewhere hot, it’s always good to have something warm for those unexpected cool moments. I.e. somewhere that’s powering aircon like crazy
•	⁠daypack. Something you can use to carry your stuff during the day
•	⁠small valuables bag. For your id’s and cards and whatnot. Good for travelling and in case you want to keep all your valuables with you when you have to separate from your main bag.
- Cash. This is emergency money that you should keep separate from the rest of your money. You never know when you might need to use it as a bribe, in case you’re robbed or you just simply don’t have access to any ATMs to get any more cash out but can’t get to one without money. One time, it was the last bit of money I had left to help me get to the airport. 

Other things that you might consider getting once you arrive at your travel country:

•	⁠plastic bags. Helps you keep your dirty clothes from stinking out your bag/clean clothes
•	⁠wet wipes. Handiest thing for anything from wiping your face on a hot sweaty day in the city to cleaning messes! (Careful with you bathroom products!)
•	⁠alcohol gel. Use it to sanitise anything from toilet seats to your hands.

You’re going to want to buy a lot of things when you’re out there so don’t overthink about what to take. You’ll probably find a cheaper more exotic version over there. When your bag gets too heavy, send a box home through post. Souvenirs, things you won’t wear anymore at this point in time, etc. plus it’s nice box of memories once you receive it at the other end :)

REMEMBER:

•	⁠EVERYTHING is replaceable; even your passport (if it happens get in touch with your embassy)
•	⁠other backpackers will be in the same boat so we all understand each other, creating a nice community that looks out for each other
•	⁠be street smart. Don’t walk around alone with valuables in a sketchy part of anywhere.
•	⁠don’t buy drugs of side sellers. Go somewhere where everyone is doing it and refrain from taking them on big nights where police will be out to make their quotas
•	⁠(not strictly necessary but I know I could have benefitted from it) get a fake id. Some places will be wanting your id as deposit for renting something and refuse to give it back until you pay them an obscene amount of money. (Doesn’t happen often but you never know)

backpacking,"Purchased a $300 ""Premium incubator"" 900 down underquilt from ""Hammock Gear"" in December. The underquilt is rated for 30F degrees.  After testing it out on a 2 night/ 3 day Sierras trip in 35-38F nightly temps (using a marmot 15F down sleeping bag) and almost freezing my ass off I decided to contact the company. Well their responses ranged from: ""you set it up wrong"", ""no one guarantees their temp ratings"",  ""send it in at your expense (both ways) for us to look at it and if there is nothing wrong with it you still own it"", ""best of luck""

In short they could care less that their product is underfilled with down, doesn't even come close to their temp ratings or any sort of customer satisfaction.

I will be living out of two backpacks and plan on starting my travels in Windhoek, Namibia.

From Windhoek I have two different options  in terms of route of travel and would love some advice or insights from the community.  

Route 1: Windhoek - Lomé 
Stops along route - Windhoek, Oshakati, (cross border to Angola) Lubango, Luanda, (cross to DRC) Kinshasa, ride the Ubangi river  up to Zongo (cross to C.A.R) Bangui, flight from Bangui to Cotonou Benin, then finally Lomé then flight home. 

Route 2: Windhoek - Nairobi 
Stops - Windhoek, Gobabis, (cross into Botswana) Ghanzi, Maun, (cross into Zambia) Livingstone, Lusaka, Chipata, (cross into Malawi) Lilongwe, Mzuzu, Karonga, (cross into Tanzania) Mbeya, Dodoma, Arusha, (cross into Kenya) Nairobi then flight home 

I’m not necessarily worried about budget as both routes have been worked out and covered. I’m more so interested in hearing about what route you would find more interesting.

backpacking,"Hey all! I'm a relatively experienced backpacker, and I'm trying to find a new place to head out into the back country, but searching all I can, I haven't found much.

In my group of three, we all like to live off the land as much as possible when we're in the back country. Foraging, fishing, and hunting small game, as well as cooking and preparing all our food. Generally speaking, we haven't had any real issues with this idea. We purchase all licenses, do our research, and only take what the land can replenish. We're all experienced, and have no problems hiking out a few miles to get to a good spot, with all our gear. We just want to be isolated from the world. There's no problem seeing other hikers on occasion, but we don't want to hear other campers or be in their sightline, you know?

I'm planning a trip to take in a couple weeks- I know, not much time. I had planned on going to the McCurtain County Wilderness Area, but I finally got in contact with the game warden, and a controlled burn is going on in my timeslot. My main backup right now is the Ozarks, a few miles into Hurricane Creek, but I've gone there several times and the fishing has been pretty poor for my group, in mid-March. Between that and the distance, I'd like something a little closer.

I love all kinds of terrain, so long as it has some elevation change, personally, as long as it can sustain us. We plan on going out 4 days and 3 nights. The only real limitation on distance, is that we have to drive there, hike out, set up camp, all in one day. As much as I would love to go out a 10 hour drive away, I can't leave much earlier than 4 AM..

I know this is a lot for a random reddit post, but maybe someone on here has some ideas? Thanks for any help, y'all. Also, if there's any similar posts I couldn't find with my googling skills, feel free to just link that.","Looking for a destination within ~6 hours of Dallas, TX, with decent small game &amp; fishing?",,Nolwest,,0,2023-02-27 21:33:13

Hello there! I (22 F) am planning a trip to India during this Summer. I plan explore a lot spiritual destinations (temples, ashrams etc) and the country in general. This will be my first time visiting India so I need as much advice as possible.

For context I plan on travelling solo or with a friend-group. How safe is India for solo female travelers? I have heard the south is better for women- is that merely a myth or a fact? What are some resources I can use to ensure my safety? Would it be advisable to travel in a group with male friends so that nothing untoward happens?

What should my budget per day be like? Based on that I'll decide the duration. I have saved up and am looking to spend a bit on better accommodation. Nothing excessive.

hi all,

maybe this has been answered here or maybe this is the wrong subreddit but....

I am planning on quitting my current job very very soon. Right after that, I am planning on backpacking for the first time!! Optimally, I would like to have a source of income whilst traveling. I am really new to this, so I am a bit lost with how to find a suitable remote part-time job. Been using all the typical platforms such as LinkedIn &amp; Indeed, but I feel there could be more to it. the job could literally be anything as long as it is part-time and remote. or maybe even something to do in the countries I'm planning on visiting (South East Asia)

any tips in regards to generating money whilst traveling would be appreciated.

backpacking,"For those that use carry-on sized backpacks (or convertible duffels) in lieu of traditional roller carry-on luggage, I'm curious what people do when it comes to day packs.

Since you're already wearing your carry-on as a backpack, do you stow your day pack inside the backpack? Or do most people who use these carry-on backpacks forgo day packs entirely (e.g. use the carry-on backpack as the day pack as well)? I suppose my question is more about the intended usage style for these bags.

I like the idea of being able to backpack my carry-on but haven't been able to make the switch yet because I'm at a slight loss about what to do with my day pack. Ideally, I'd want to avoid shouldering my carry-on backpack while adventuring at the destination since it is quite heavy and relatively large. But in order to bring along a day pack, I'll have to pack it inside the carry-on backpack itself and that takes up space.

In my current setup, I travel with a day pack ([Deuter Speed Lite 20](https://www.amazon.com/Deuter-Unisex-Adults-Hiking-Backpack/dp/B08JQYTZNG)) + a roller carry-on. I use the day pack for all my adventuring at the destination. The roller carry-on stays at the lodging.

Some examples of carry-on backpacks I'm referring to:

- What countries do you recommend travelling to? I’m looking for area(s) with great nightlife, warmer weather, beautiful landscapes, fun excursion opportunities, and preferably english speaking (I feel a language barrier may be overwhelming for my first time travelling alone, but this is flexible!)
- Do you guys have any recommended apps or websites to look for proper accommodations (hostels)/transport/proper backpacking gear? 
- Lastly, would you recommend a type of trip in which you can get a work visa and live in a country for a full year working/volunteering, or have you preferred to do a 6 month backpacking trip where your days are filled with excursions and solo exploration!

backpacking,"Hi everybody! I am doing my first trip to Europe and am leaving March 5th. I'll be going by myself and staying in hostels, with somewhat of an itinerary already planned out, with some hostels and flights already booked. However, I am still indecisive about the amount of time spent and cities I go to.

So far, this is what I have planned out and booked:

**Barcelona (March 6 - 12)**  
**Lisbon (March 12 - 16)**  
**London (March 16 - 20)**

From there, the itinerary I had planned out was this:

**Edinburgh  (March 20 - 23)**  
**Amsterdam (March 23 - 26)**  
**Bruges or Ghent (March 26 - 29)**  
**Paris (March 29 - April 3)**  
**Rome (April 3 - April 8)**  
**Florence (April 8 - April 13)**  
**Venice (April 13 - April 14)**  
**Cinque Terre (April 14 - April 16)**

In the end, I do have to be back in Barcelona by April 19th for my flight back, so there are 2 - 3 days that I have to either add a city nearby, or stay extra time in another city I am already visiting. I was also considering switching Edinburgh for Prague, but the fact that it is kind of out of the way makes me rethink it. The reason I am considering it though is because many friends have recommended it. Any recommendations regarding that, or possible changes to my planned itinerary are appreciated. Also, I will be staying in hostels and planning to meet people, which makes me want to stay a little longer in each city.

I will be in San Francisco with a friend early April, and we'll have 3 spare days. We love hiking, and we would like to perform a multi-days backpacking experience, ideally in a National Park. 

We were originally thinking to Yosemite. However, when checking their website, it doesn't look encouraging in the winter: https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/wildwinter.htm

I'm not too worried about the snow or the cold. But avalanche risks and getting lost are more concerning. I backpacked already several times, but in the summer, with no snow. My friend has no prior experience in camping. So that may perhaps be too tricky/dangerous for us.

I have ultimately come to the conclusion that homelessness is going to be my path forward, due to the lack of affordable housing and jobs that provide for the disabled (living with my family is *not* an option). I also cannot drive, much to my detriment. And office jobs? No thanks.

I can see everything I’ve ever wanted, make new friends, and get away from all the toxicity I am surrounded with on a constant basis? Sign me up! Except….how do I pay for it? That’s the catch.

Hostels aren’t always cheap, and I’ve planned to do a general rotation between them and camping or, rarely, couchsurfing. But for the everyday basics? Well, most workaway, worldpackers and other sites like those are primarily for those who can assist in back-breaking labour, so I can’t do that. Hostel work might be a good idea, but scoring it at every single location? Unlikely. Digital nomading? I have no skills for an office job in a sedentary lifestyle so why would I’ve some on the road?

This brings me to SSI, seeing as it is most likely the backbone of my future financial situation. Can you somehow, go around the world like a normal person would, using primarily SSI + savings, with secondary sources that earn a bit? Obviously, there might be a couple hundred I could score just by doing things, but using primarily SSI, is it possible to live on the road and go around the world (using slow travel, ofc) just on that?

Both of these routes have sleeper trains, however, the Budapest to Krakow one is $150 for a 3-bed compartment, and the Krakow to Prague train is $91 for the same.

In comparison, Flixbus has nightbuses between those destinations that are like $18 each. I realize my quality of sleep would be worse on a Flixbus, and I don't get a bed to sleep in like with the night train, but I just can't seem to justify an extra $100 just for a bed, especially when the hostels I'm staying at are like $20/night.

I guess another option with Flixbus is to just take the 6am bus option which gets me to my destinations around noon each day I travel. However, that will eat up part of my day, so I think I'd rather night bus it if I'm going the bus route at all.

I am looking forward to hearing from you, I was looking at the aer day pack 2, but it's very expensive to ship to Germany. 

Also the Kanken Laptop 17"", but I have no experience with this and it looks uncomfortable? Any experiences? No padding and thin straps? Also, not much internal organization, 1 more pocket for smaller stuff would be nice.

Anyway, hope you have some advice :)",comfortable personal item backpackl,,vegane-currywurst,,0,2023-02-24 19:01:30

In the nearest future I'm planning to do more serious backpacking and hope to save some weight by buying an **ultralight tent**, but **I'm rather tall at 193 cm (\~6'4ft)**. I have been looking at trekking pole tents for some time now and to me it looks like it's a perfect backpacking option, because how light they are and the volume savings are insane. Sadly the best tent out there - Durston x-mid is only sold in America and if you want get it in Europe you have to pay quite steep custom fees + shipping... My budget is **around 300€/260£** (could be a little more for a good option, but prefer spending less). The tent should weigh **as light as possible** (&lt;1,5kg), **true 2 persons tent would be ideal (2 long wide sleeping pads)**.

Secondly, because I live in Lithuania and here we don't have a lot of tents options to choose from and the good ones are overpriced  (used market is not existing), I want to know what are the **best e-shops to buy tent/backcountry gear in Europe?**

Since I haven’t been able to find a good backpack that fits him securely, I carry food for both us. (I’ve tried all the brands, btw, and it’s so hard to fit anything on my lithe, tall 67 lb standard poodle). I’m mostly a weekend warrior but I also like to spend up to 4-5 nights out whenever I can, so it has to be large enough to hold our food and smellables for that long, but also short enough to fit sideways in my pack - Gregory Kalmia 60L.

Hi all, we will update Camping tips series in different tourist attraction of the USA, let's start from tips in different National Parks:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ez5radv5r1ka1.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=baf612bdfd32123bf3392ef864e5e824aa4f9448

National Parks in the USA offer some of the most beautiful camping spots in the world, and they are a perfect destination for families who want to experience the great outdoors. However, while camping can be a lot of fun, it's important to be prepared for any situation, including power outages or emergencies. Here are some camping tips for families who are traveling to different National Parks of the USA, and why emergency power and solar panel systems are important while camping.

# Grand Canyon National Park

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8g58ein6r1ka1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e6837c4e00eccd8c9c5317c36fae51360f2534f4

The Grand Canyon is one of the most popular National Parks in the USA, and it's a great destination for families who want to experience the beauty of the Southwest. However, the park's remote location and limited access to electricity can pose challenges for families who are camping. That's why it's important to have a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, to ensure that you have access to power in case of an emergency.

Specific Usage Scenario of Emergency Power in Grand Canyon National Park:

1. Charging devices: Having a portable generator or solar panel system can help keep your devices charged while camping.
2. Lighting: In case of an emergency, having a backup power source can provide lighting for your campsite.
3. Medical equipment: If someone in your family requires medical equipment that relies on electricity, having a backup power source can be life-saving.

# Yellowstone National Park

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9c9h27d7r1ka1.jpg?width=730&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d1387ed49d593b2b8198d4a1514fb710f6f0931

Yellowstone is another popular National Park that offers some of the most beautiful camping spots in the USA. However, the park's remote location and limited access to electricity can pose challenges for families who are camping. That's why it's important to have a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, to ensure that you have access to power in case of an emergency.

Specific Usage Scenario of Emergency Power in Yellowstone National Park:

1. Charging devices: Having a portable generator or solar panel system can help keep your devices charged while camping.
2. Heating and cooling: If the temperature drops at night, having an electric heater can provide warmth, and if the temperature rises during the day, having an electric fan can provide cooling.
3. Refrigeration: If you have perishable food or drinks, having a backup power source can ensure that your food stays cold and fresh.

# Yosemite National Park

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0fxjhj18r1ka1.jpg?width=1250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bfd9fc4e4cafbec15b87d3b39652af5ee09e077e

Yosemite is another National Park that offers stunning camping spots for families who are traveling. However, the park's limited access to electricity can pose challenges for families who are camping. That's why it's important to have a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, to ensure that you have access to power in case of an emergency.

Specific Usage Scenario of Emergency Power in Yosemite National Park:

1. Charging devices: Having a portable generator or solar panel system can help keep your devices charged while camping.
2. Lighting: In case of an emergency, having a backup power source can provide lighting for your campsite.
3. Cooking: If you have an electric stove or grill, having a backup power source can ensure that you can cook your meals.

Emergency power and solar panel systems are important while camping for a few reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2a4p5vbgr1ka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0410e9f72e91dfa5c5916847543fd7554ea60105

First, they can help keep you safe in case of an emergency. For example, if someone in your family requires medical attention, having a backup power source can be life-saving.

Second, they can provide comfort and convenience while camping. For example, having an electric heater or fan can help keep you comfortable during extreme temperatures.

Third,emergency power and solar panel systems can also help reduce your environmental impact while camping. Instead of relying on fossil fuels for power, a solar panel system can harness energy from the sun, which is a clean and renewable source of energy. This can help reduce your carbon footprint while still providing the power you need for your camping trip.

When choosing an emergency power source or solar panel system, it's important to consider the specific needs of your family and the camping location you will be visiting. For example, if you will be camping in a remote location with limited access to electricity, a portable generator may be the best option. However, if you will be camping in an area with ample sunlight, a solar panel system may be a more practical and eco-friendly choice. And there are some Emergency brands that are recommed: Jackery/Bluetti/Ecoflow/Bigblue/Togopower/[Yargopower](https://yargopower.com/)/goalzero etc.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vmhk3mghr1ka1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4dfae1691f526b61c21f6be212200fc522dac814

In addition to having a backup power source, there are a few other camping tips that can help make your trip more enjoyable and safe.

First, make sure to bring plenty of food, water, and supplies for your family, as well as any necessary camping gear.

Second, be prepared for the weather by bringing appropriate clothing and gear for different conditions.

Finally, make sure to follow park rules and regulations, and practice Leave No Trace principles to help protect the environment and wildlife.

In conclusion, camping in National Parks of the USA can be an amazing experience for families who want to connect with nature and create lasting memories. However, it's important to be prepared for any situation, including power outages or emergencies. By having a backup power source, such as a portable generator or solar panel system, you can ensure that your family has access to power and stays safe during your camping trip.",Camping Tips for Families travelling in National Parks of the USA,,Yargopower,,0,2023-02-24 02:26:41

backpacking,"I spent 3 months backpacking South East Asia (September 26, 2022 - December 22, 2022). I went to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia.

backpacking,"I am traveling over to europe in July. I have a rough estimate on where I want to be staying/visiting. I know 25 days is not nearly enough time to be fully submerged in the culture but that’s all I have to work with. My question is how strict do I have to be when it comes to hostels and bus tickets/hopper flight bookings etc. my fear is that I get to a place, love it and want to stay and then be screwed the entire trip with no bookings to other hotels/rooms and such. I know July is a high tourist month, but surely it’s okay to be flexible to an extent?

features I want are an arm/back/headrest (doesn't need padding, just support) I want to be able to nap in it comfortably with my whole body supported (lower body supported by ground is fine of course).

backpacking,"While most people dream of long-term trips, exploring every corner of the world, I think shorter, more frequent trips are the way to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be a travel addict. I spent years saving money to take long-term trips to exotic destinations. I backpacked through Southeast Asia, traveled the Trans-Siberian Railway, and explored the mountains of South America. I thought I had it all figured out.

&amp;#x200B;

But after years of travel, I realized that I was burning out. It was exhausting to constantly move from place to place, living out of a backpack and never truly feeling settled. I missed the comfort of a stable home and the routine of daily life.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided to switch things up. Instead of taking long-term trips, I started taking shorter ones, a week at a time at maximum. I would plan these trips months in advance so I had something to look forward to, but I wouldn't spend months on the road.

&amp;#x200B;

This change allowed me to slow down and truly enjoy each destination. I could immerse myself in the local culture rather than rushing through a list of tourist attractions. I could relax, take my time, and truly experience each place.

&amp;#x200B;

And the best part? I could travel with just a Voyager leather carry-on bag. This bag is the perfect size for a short trip and stylish enough to bring to both casual and formal settings. It's also incredibly durable, which is vital for someone who's always on the go.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit it was hard to give up my long-term travel dreams. But I'm so glad I did. I now have a healthy balance between traveling and having a stable home life. I can take short trips whenever I want and thoroughly enjoy each destination without feeling rushed or burned out.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I believe that short, frequent trips are the way to go. And if you're going to do that, then traveling with just a Voyager leather carry-on bag is the best option. It's versatile, durable, and stylish, allowing you to pack everything you need without overpacking. So, give it a try - you might just be surprised at how much you love it.","Why Shorter, More Frequent Trips Are the Key to Travel Happiness",,DrowsilyTide85,,0,2023-02-22 10:51:55

I am planning to backpack through Asia for a year and have a bit of a dilemma. I own an Omega watch that I bought for myself as a long-awaited treat, but I'm not sure if I should take it with me on my trip.

So, I wanted to ask if any of you have backpacked through Asia with a luxury watch or any other valuable item, and if so, would you recommend it? Did you face any issues or concerns during your trip, or did you find it to be a valuable and worthwhile accessory to bring along?

I like to hike/enjoy nature, spend time by lovely bodies of water, walk around cool towns/cities with lovely architecture (especially historical ones), eat local cuisine, enjoy a few drinks (not really clubbing). 

I understand I will be moving fast (if I go with this plan); faster than many on Reddit would likely recommend. I understand this is ambitious. 


My main two questions are:

- Does this path make sense (not “would you personally travel this way?” but “if you were to try to hit all these stops, is this the route you would take?”

- How can I add in Transylvania?


Here is my rough itinerary (questions are in parentheses):


Macedonia:

Fly into Skopje

Skopje for 3 days (maybe day trip to canyon matka/kozjak lake)

—&gt; Ohrid for 3 days


Albania:

—&gt; Berat (1 day)
(is this possible?)

(Would it be possible to tack on gjirokaster here? If so, maybe check out the blue eye or a beach around Sarandë)

—&gt; theth / valbona (1 day hike) 
(Komani lake looks lovely, so maybe here if it’s possible)


Montenegro:

—&gt; Durmitor national park (1-2 days)

—&gt; Kotor (4 days)


Croatia:

—&gt; Dubrovnik (1 day)
(is lokrum worth it?)


Montenegro:

—&gt; Mostar and Sarajevo (3 days at each) 
(What order?)


Croatia:

—&gt; Split and nearby islands (3 days)
(recommend staying in Split or on Hvar or another island?)

—&gt; Plitvicka (1 day)


Slovenia:

—&gt; Ljubljana (3 days)

—&gt; Bled, bohinj, Triglav (3 days)



Main questions (not previously listed):

- Does this route make sense?
- For which legs of this will the travel be really difficult?
- Are there any areas that really deserve more/less time (of course, I know I could do a week in Sarajevo, for example, but is there anything really glaring?)
- Is anything in here an easy skip? Am I missing anything major?
- I really want to add in some time in Transylvania, how can I incorporate this most easily?

So I’m leaving my job March 31st 

I’ve booked tickets to go to Thailand Bangkok on April 12 from London

I plan to do northern Thailand then southern Thailand then fly to Bali and see how I feel. Go home when I’m ready

I haven’t done any planning. I don’t have any work to do on my notice period so I have time to plan.

I’m just wondering if I’ve made the right decision and if you have advice and where to start. All the information is so overwhelming when I research 😬

I’ve also decided to start taking SSRIs now in the hope that my mental health is better by the time I go so I can enjoy the experience more but I don’t know if it’s a bad idea. 

I have no idea what I’m going to do career wise- if I want to stay in the same field or train up in something else so I’m not sure whether to sort that out first 

I was mainly worried about sitting around and doing nothing so it was making me anxious. So I booked the flight, now I’m worried I was too hasty with it

I have about $12k savings but obviously don’t want to blow through that. After my travels I’m moving across the country, furnishing an apartment etc. and I have student loans lol

I have never solo traveled and am very worried about getting lonely.

Idea 1: Australia/Fiji
I was initially thinking Australia/Fiji, but the Australia component is quickly becoming expensive ($45/night for shared room hostels) and not a lot of WWOOF opportunities near big cities/attractions. However, I still am really interested in this plan but I just don’t know if there’s a cheaper way to swing it. I also felt comfortable with this plan because I’ve heard the locals are very nice, easy to make friends with locals, and I can speak the language so I figured it would be easier to get around within the country 

Idea 2: Thailand/Indonesia 
Another long time travel dream of mine. Expensive to get there but super cheap once you’re there. I’ve heard it’s backpacker friendly but I’m still worried about getting lonely from fleeting friendships and wanting to go on adventures but not having anyone to do it with. Also worried about the language barrier.

Any suggestions or thoughts? Open to any other locations (except South America, I’ve been all over that continent and looking for something different). I’m not sure what to do. The main things I want are: finding other backpackers to travel with, not getting lonely, not too expensive if possible, safe for young female solo travelers.

I'd like to go with as much merino wool as I can get away with given the frequency I'll be wearing things between washes. I've already got underwear and socks covered, so I'm really only interested in advice on the shirts, shorts and pants.

I've read merino wool alone is a fairly weak material, and is best combine with other material to add durability. What companies should I be looking at for shirt and short suggestions? I'd like limit what I bring to approximately what the guide I quoted above suggested, but I also don't want the bag to eat through the shirts, or me to eat through shorts. 

I found the following brands
    * https://unboundmerino.com/collections/shirts
    * https://woolandprince.com/collections/all
    * https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/mens
    * https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-tops#facet=product_type:%22Crew+Neck%22,product_type:%22Button+Down%22,product_type:%22Polo%22&amp;beginIndex=0

Some of the above brands seem more lifestyle type, so I'm unsure if their shirts or pants/shorts will last the trip. What do I need to be looking for for from both a durability perspective, but can double as street clothing while I'm in Florence and other cities?

backpacking,"A few months ago I made a post breaking down how much money I have spent traveling full-time over 8 months.

My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have been traveling for 10 months. Our first 8 months were spent in Eastern Europe and at the end of December we came to Japan.

Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! I hope to share this info to show that you can travel to unique places on a tight budget! 

In Europe, we used a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This was not possible in Japan, we did not set a $ amount that we had to be under but we did try to be frugal and the budget was in mind all the time. 

IF YOU ARE COMING TO JAPAN ON HOLIDAY I REALLY RECOMMEND SAVING MONEY AND SPENDING IT! 

This was my 3rd time in Japan and my girlfriend’s 1st. In Europe, we did not feel we missed out on much by being on a budget but in Japan, it is a different story. Don’t get me wrong, we had a lot of fun, but there was so much left undone because of the budget. It mostly boils down to food. We ate a lot of meals from convenience stores. We skipped a lot of the expensive seafood that if I was on holiday would have bought without a second thought.

We tried to always eat the local specialty. Raw chicken sashimi in Kagoshima and Fugu in Shimonoseki are good examples of that. 

You definitely can do things on a budget, we went to Fukuoka the tonkotsu(pork broth) ramen capital of Japan, and ate at some of the highest-rated ramen restaurants, which was very affordable. A lot of major sights and attractions are free. 

This is just one person's spend and we split basically everything. I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions you may feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

IN TOTAL I SPENT $2,768.28 or $58.89 per day. THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION/ FLIGHTS/ RAIL PASS

Some detail about the categories:

Accommodation $1,006.91 - Hostels were the primary accommodation. It was always a mixed dorm and never a private room. 5 nights we spent in an airbnb solely because there were no hostel beds available. 6 nights were “free” thanks to my cousin who lives in Akita and let us stay with him. I put quotes on that because while he didn’t charge us to stay with him, we did end up paying \~$130 to take the Shinkansen from Akita back to Tokyo, and bought him a few meals and stuff. 2 nights were spent in hotels because stuff went sideways (more on that later)

Activities $97.73 - Castles, Capybara and Micro Pig Cafes, Ninja Theme Park, Museums, and Onsens.

Alcohol $103.21 - I drank so much more during my time in Japan compared to Europe. I want to say it was because it was so cold out and meeting/socializing with so many other people in hostels. 

Coffee $8.34 - This is the occasional coffee from a 7-Eleven or a vending machine. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation. I did bring with me a lot of caffeine pills. I really like how I can wake up and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill and be good to go, they are also cheaper than coffee. My girlfriend doesn't take them primarily because she enjoys drinking coffee so much. The pills are $.03 each. 

Food $341.93 - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health $25.76 - Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc $14.03 - Kerosene to refill my cousins heaters. 

Mobile Phone $0 - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States, but my girlfriend does. If I didn’t have her phone to use I would have bought a sim card. 

Souvenir $4.08 - I try to buy a magnet in each country 

Transportation(local) $184.79 - This is using trains/buses to get around a city. We did not take a taxi or use a ride-share app while in Japan. 

Travel $595.96 - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Our flight was paid for with 35,000 American Airlines miles +$5.60. This also includes our 21-day Rail Pass.

Things that went right: The Japanese people are so friendly and welcoming. When the trains got canceled and we got stuck in Yonago, the people working at JR tried everything they could to help us. We walked to 7 different hotels with snow coming down and we must have walked past this one cafe so many times because the old couple who ran it came out to ask if we were ok and the husband walked with us to 4 more hotels and spoke to the people for us to get us a room. 

The couple who sat next to us at the Izakaya in Kagoshima helped us because we had no idea what we were doing. Ended up becoming friends and spent the next 4 hours sharing food and drinking together. 

The random people who would ask if we needed help navigating the train stations. The people are lovely. 

What went Wrong: The weather. This was to be expected since we flew into Japan on December 30. Our plan was to visit Matsue, and then take the overnight train from Matsue to Tokyo and continue on to Kanazawa. The massive amount of snow canceled those trains, we ended up getting ushered onto a train that went to Yonago and then that got canceled so a lot of people were forced to get hotel rooms (see above for the hero of that story). There was no guarantee we could get out of Yonago because it snowed all night but we got to the station at 5:45 am to try and get the 6 am train and we managed to escape! We did not get to go to Kanazawa because the trains all got canceled and we were afraid of getting stuck there and missing our reservation in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. 

While the Shinkansen rarely gets canceled the express trains and local trains get canceled all the time due to weather. Something to note.

Favorite Cities:

1. Hakodate - Cool history, good food, very cute.
2. Kagoshima - Amazing food, the soy sauce there was the best I have ever had. You can eat raw chicken sashimi there (torisashi), I thought it was ok but not great. Sand onsen nearby was amazing. 
3. Sapporo - Big city, the food in Hokkaido is absolutely incredible. Lots of cool day trips to take from here. 

Some useful resources: 

1. Ramen Database- Also has curry, gyoza, udon, soba, etc. you can search by all time ranking, by year, by prefecture, pretty cool tool and we used it a lot to find some amazing food! Ramendb.supleks .jp
2. JR pass calculator, you can plan out your route and it will show if it is worth getting the JR pass. 

I don’t know if this is allowed but we have made and are making more budget-oriented videos about this trip across Japan. You can find that stuff on our Reddit profile. 

I hope this helps anyone who dreams of going to Japan but doesn't have a ton of money. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want more info!

I have booked a plane ticket to Prague, Czechia, Mid-May, and I have until early September to travel.

Last summer I did the exact same thing, but landed in Athens, toured around Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Bosnia, Albania, ending in Slovenia. Amazing trip.

Schengen was a distant thought.

This year, including Prague, I plan on taking roughly 3 weeks to explore the Czech Republic, then one month to explore Poland, then one month in Slovakia and Hungary.

This fills my 3month, 90day schengen non-visa time.

I still have one month left (will be the month of august) where I will be broke, and not willing to fly back, yet will not be able to enter Schengen countries.

backpacking,"Honestly, I could complain about this for days. From so many different angles. But for me right now the problem I’m most irritated at lately is the global travelers themselves.

People seem to be only interested, or at least an overwhelming majority of people, in going places they have already seen or heard about. Massively contributing to over-tourism and overcrowding, for what? Keeping up with Jonses? Never really thinking critically about where they should go or what it might impact? Does everyone actually love art history so much that we need to queue for the Mona Lisa? Or have people just heard about it. 

Call me incredibly salty, I probably am, but I’ve worked my ass off for 4 years with my wife on a high quality travel YouTube channel entirely dedicated to off path places. To digging deep and travelling past the trip advisor. Hiking along 1000 year old medieval pilgrim paths in Tuscany with more hidden gems than you can imagine, places that desperately could do with some tourism dollars, a mere 20 minute train ride from tourist clogged Florence. I go out into the woods to show a truly authentic German beer festival where the old traditions are alive and well instead of just covering Oktoberfest. I go to the sorts of difficult Alpine Christmas markets that many locals haven’t even heard about instead of just showcasing Munich and Nuremberg. I was the only person that week to visit several Ancient Greek cities in Turkey that are mind blowing. I have these places entirely to myself, places that would love and benefit from some tourism. If only we stopped concentrating it one or two places and instead spread it around. 

Do you know what kind of viewership the truly off path stuff gets? Zilch. Nothing. A crumb. I’m faxt it negatively impacts the growth of my channel for months. 

But yet if I do a video about a place people are already familiar with? Oh boy, tons of views.

The market pressure is on the influencer to be a sell out. 

It does my head in. If you want to travel deeper and not just be another tourist then you have to put in some work and at least expose yourself to new things, but from what I can tell by the travel audience at large….this is not what they do. I’ll hold your hand and take you to the hidden gems you say you want, all you have to do is click. 

I used to blame the influencers. Then I tried to become one to break the chain and do my part. Now I see how the people who got big, got big and it’s our fault.

It breaks my heart. Truly.

— if you want to see the proof for yourself you can find me on YouTube at NearFromHome. You’ll see the viewership for itself. Or, if my content is crap then you are welcome to give me a well deserved reality check.

Sorry for the rant though guys. Just feeling pretty frustrated at the moment.",The problems with over-tourism aren’t the travel influencers but the basic travelers who say they want to see hidden gems but won’t put in the effort to try and find new places to go | A Salty Rant.,,strawbennyjam,,0,2023-02-18 16:26:39

backpacking," 

Hello everyone!

I am currently looking at buying a big ass backpack, around 100 litres or more, I'm going on a long trip + with camera gear (so need lots of space). The most important thing for more other than size is how it is to carry, but also that it has a large front opening so I can easily grab my camera gear...

Now I have tried both the Fjellraven Kajka 100 l and Gregory Baltoro Pro 100 l, I think the Gregory fits a bit better, but that might just be because the Kajka wasn't fitted to my size (They only have one size that you need to fit to your size, whereas the Gregory has three sizes so they already kinda fit). I'm going some pretty rough places, and the Kajka seems better suited for that, but when I'm carrying 25 kg (maybe more or less), I want it to be as comfortable as possible.

Well, what do you guys/girls think? Any other backpack recommendations? keep in mind I live in Europe so not all American backpacks are available.

backpacking,"I spent the last couple of months saving up money. I hated my job so I decided quit and travel around Europe. I'm a young French-American male who hopes to travel and enjoy the European life. I enjoy history (especially ancient history), food, drinks, any type of music (from Jazz and classical to rap), hiking, and slow travel. I lived in the US all my life but I have plenty of family still in France. I am a French citizenship (speak it fluently) and have a decent level of Spanish.

This is going to be my first solo trip so a little nervous about that. But, thankfully I have had plenty of opportunities to travel in my youth with my family. During this trip I don't really want to have everything planned out. My only plan as of right now is to start in Barcelona for around 5 days maybe more maybe less depending on how I like it. Then travel all around the Iberian Peninsula. Then take a ferry to Morocco spend maybe a week then continue traveling western Europe. When the 2 month Eurail pass expires then head to Central Europe, then Eastern Europe then maybe end in Balkans. I think I will begin this journey in Early March.

After doing a lot of research there are a couple of questions.

1. Sim cards: For sim cards I was looking at Holafly. I was wondering how were your experiences with it or is there a better option?
2. Credit Card: I was looking at my current bank and the exchange rates were very high. I was thinking about using Revolt. Are there any better options?
3. Inter/Eurail: Would Interrail pass be worth it? I was thinking about getting the 2 month with 10 days pass. Use the pass for western Europe where the trains are better then head to Balkans and Eastern and Central Europe for the latter two months using the occasional train but mainly busses and ferries.
4. Public Transport: Being from California where public transportation is horrific, I have little to no experience with it. I was wondering what were the best apps/websites to find the right routes/transportation? And any other tips.
5. Travel insurance: This is probably more personal preference but do I need it and if so what company should I consider?
6. Passport: When I travel should I bring French or US passport or both? I know some places like Italy give huge discounts to EU citizens so French passport might be best for that.
7. Festivals: Any music festival recommendations? I was looking at ABROADFEST 2023 in Barcelona although a little expensive.
8. Recommendations: On my trip I am most excited for Istanbul (not sure now with the earthquake), Turkish Baths, Bulgarian baths, Granada, Lake Bled, and Hikes in Slovenia and Croatia. Any recommendations for cities, countries, museums, food, and hostels?
9. Reading: I really want to read a book of the country I am traveling in. Wether the author was from that Area or it happened in the area. Same things goes for movies, tv shows, and music. 
10. Any other tips or critics about the trip?

I think most of my concerns is pre-travel stress and worried about the trip. It will defiantly be a learning experience and be a major point of growth. I hope I covered everything.

I want to get him some for his birthday in a few weeks, but am also having trouble finding well-reviewed vegan hiking boots. Although it seems there are some options for less intensive hiking/trail running, he's looking for more heavy-duty boots with ankle support for multi-day backpacking, which appear to be scarce. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Do folks have experience with any particular boots they can share?

backpacking,"I'm a Girl Scout leader in eastern Pennsylvania with an awesome group of 9th graders who are into backpacking. We're doing a small section of the AT this spring, and they want to visit a National Park somewhere in the western US this summer. They first suggested Yellowstone, but everything I'm reading about Yellowstone seems to be saying that we would have to rent cars just to get us to trailheads, and I don't love that idea. I would prefer to be able to use public transit for paperwork/insurance reasons (we can't just hitchhike or use unregistered shuttles). 

So, which National Parks do you think we could visit that would fit this bill?

1. Close to a major airport
2. Public transit to trailheads
3. Medium to moderately difficult section hike options (around 5 days)
4. Not-impossible-to-get backcountry camping permits (for 8-10 people)

Most of my scouts have not traveled much outside of our troop outings, so ideally, I'd also like it to be a trail that goes past at least one notable landmark so that they can say, ""I got to see \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ when I was a Girl Scout!"" I realize that's a tall order, but I figured if anyone is up to the task, it's reddit.

In November 2021, I booked a one-way ticket.

Why?

There are multiple reasons why I moved.

The main one being, I didn't want to live in the West anymore. I wanted to move to a more conservative environment closer to my beliefs and values. Far from big cities and pollution, somewhere remote, calm and closer to nature.

I also wanted to leave the comfort I was in, I didn't want to regret not doing the move when I'm in old age. I can't imagine living in regret in my death bed and thinking to myself: ""Why didn't I do it?""

Life's about experiences.

backpacking,"So I’m going to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for 3 months, and then going to Ecuador for 3 months. I was initially going to buy a Deuter 70L bag because I feel like I won’t pack toooo lightly and I’d like to bring back some gifts. It’s a proper hiking backpack that would be cool to have for future multiple day hikes. However, I’m mostly staying in 1 or 2 places while I’m in South America and not moving around too much aside from a few day hikes. Not sure if I want to lug around a huge backpack everywhere I go. I’m thinking of buying a Thule backpack that turns into a tog bag for all my stuff that I can put into cargo when flying (I really want my full range of toiletries while I’m traveling 😂) and getting a small Deuter backpack that I can use for carry on (books, journal, headphones etc.) and also for 1 or 2 day hikes. Just not sure if a 30L is a waste of money as I might need a bigger one for overnight treks in the future. 

So essentially, I want to put a bag into cargo that has a lot of space for all my clothes, my toiletries and gifts on the way back. I also need a good quality bag for carry on so that I can keep my books and art supplies on me during flights and layovers that can also double as a day bag. Thoughts? Should I commit to the 70L Deuter backpack and get a tiny tote bag or something for journals and stuff that I’d take with me everywhere I go (not sure what luggage storage will be like in Latin America so I might have to take all my possessions with me everywhere when I go on hikes/day trips) or should I split the load more and get more of a tog bag vibe and a small, decent hiking backpack that I can use for day trips?","Looking at backpacks now for South America, I need some guidance please ❤️",,seblangod,,0,2023-02-17 10:39:31

backpacking,"Hi!   
This is a really long meandering post but I don't know anyone who's done this so any help would be much appreciated.

I'm 27F and thinking about taking a break from work, or if they don't let me, quitting my job and going backpacking for a while.

In the last year, I did a few small solo trips (to other countries in Europe, staying in a hostel for 4-5 days.) I found those experiences intense, profound and very liberating. I know it's small fry comparatively but I never would have had the balls to do anything like that when I was younger.

Apart from that, it's pretty limited to week long holidays with family and mates. I've always wanted to travel, I grew up with my mum telling me all these mad stories about her year in Greece when she was 20. I just never got round to it. I had uni, I had a career, I had a sick parent, there was a pandemic. Whatever. But I am now getting that cold feeling in my stomach that if I don't do it now, I'll never do it. I don't have many responsibilities - I rent, I'm single. People older than me keep telling me now is the time to do it.

But I am struggling to think of where. I mean there's a whole world, it's so hard to narrow it down and I feel overwhelmed. I was wondering if people could help suggest places.

I'm incredibly fortunate to have inherited money after my mum died a few years ago so I would be comfortable splashing £10-15k ($12-18k) for a ""trip of a lifetime"". I would want to go for 3 to 6 months to justify the cost and the disruption when I get back. I think June would be the absolute earliest I could do it.

So I have a peanut allergy. Had it since infancy, carry two epipens, never had anything approaching anaphylaxis but I live in Ireland, we're not that peanut-y. So it's probably safe to say I should exclude SEA. Which is a bummer, cause I'd probably go there if it wasn't for the allergy.

I don't want to do Europe, as I live here and it's easy for me to do small trips. I don't want to do North America as it's v. expensive and the public transport is bad.

But apart from that, I really don't know. I'm not too bothered by weather. I love the idea of Latin America, like Chile/Argentina, the idea of going hiking in beautiful countrysides but then being able to go to cities sounds incredible. I'm a bit wary of the safety aspect though, and my spanish is only like A1/A2. 

I then thought about Japan, which was a childhood dream, but I thought 3 months might get difficult financially and it could get a bit samey, only being in one country. Maybe Japan/Taiwan/South Korea? Would probably cost a fortune though.

My most recent thought is New Zealand/Australia, maybe more for 3 months. I'd worry that again I would get bored, I like the outdoors but I do like culture and cities a lot too, and that I might regret spending that much money just to go somewhere so culturally similar.

I am planning on solo camping the Tour Du Mont Blanc this summer. My questions is around the best way to go about booking the tail end of my trip, and is not specific to this trail other than the fact that I may have a flexible end date. For the last 3 nights, it will be a judgement call on how far I go/where I camp, which could result in an extra day potentially.

I am thinking it makes the most sense to give myself an extra day in planning travel, and book a hotel for the night of the extra day -&gt; book flight home the day after that. For the night before, I will book cheaper accommodation. That way if I finish early, I will have a place to stay, but I will not be wasting money on a nicer place if I do not finish in time.

backpacking,"Hello everyone. I'm going to be backpacking for 6 months or more around Chile, Peru, Bolivia and am planning lots of hiking and trekking, possibly at altitudes over 4500m. Trying to find some insurance companies which cover trekking above that even though this may only happen a few times. I have found some companies but have been quite shocked by prices - probably this is just my extreme naivety because I haven't done long-duration backpacking for a loooong time, and also have never tried to include activities like this,  but most of them are coming in at 1000 quid or more. Anyone have experience with this kind of insurance and have any suggestions, even if it's to say that seems about right and suck it up? I probably only need that higher level of cover for a short period but don't think the insurance companies I've looked at are that flexible. 

I'm a UK resident and also do have to declare mild asthma even though it's been 10 years since I've needed medication - this is possibly some of the issue as the cheaper options don't cover pre-existing conditions, but lots don't care unless you've had issues in the last 5 years.

backpacking,"# Hi everyone!

I was looking for any answers on how to shop like a local in different countries **on a budget,** because I feel like it's often a hassle to try different supermarkets, convenience stores or farmers markets until you start to get a feeling for which are the ones with actually good prices.

  
I found out that for many there is not much information out there.  Thats why I came up with the idea to create a post to incurage others to write a few sentences what you think is a good way to buy groceries in your country/Area or about some place which you are familiar with. That way we can create a collection at which somone can look at.

So feel free to comment about places that you know! :)   
Also please let me know if there is already some post like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I am originally from Germany:

# Germany

**Affordable Supermarkets:** Lidl, Aldi, Netto, Penny (All options here also have some organic products)  
**Mid-Range Supermarkets:** Rewe, Edeka, Real (All options here also have some organic products)  
**Orangic &amp; pricy supermarkets:** Alnatura (organic), Tegut (mostly organic)

**Drugstores:** DM, Rossmann, Müller (I feel like there is no big price difference, correct me if I'm wrong)  
Drugstores also often sell food, escpecially organic and vegan products. They are also relatively affordable,

Every bigger supermarket-chain has their own brand which is relatively cheap. Rewe-&gt;JA!, Tegut-&gt;Jeden Tag, Edeka-&gt;Gut &amp; Günstig, etc.

Farmer markets are a great spot for a stroll on a nice saturday morning! I don't go to markets often, but I feel like they are often more expensive then supermarkets.

backpacking," 

Staying in hostels typically involves sharing a dormitory-style room with other travelers, although private rooms may also be available. You can expect to find communal areas such as kitchens, lounges, and bathrooms, and many hostels offer additional amenities like laundry facilities, free Wi-Fi, and organized activities.

To make the most of your stay, it's important to be respectful of your fellow travelers by keeping noise levels low and being considerate in shared spaces. Take advantage of the hostel's communal areas to meet new people and learn about the local culture. Join in on organized activities or ask the staff for recommendations on things to do in the area. Additionally, be sure to secure your belongings by using lockers or other provided storage options.

I recently was laid off from my job (working in tech) and think it would be a good time to get some travel in before I move to Australia and start working again. Since I plan to end my rental tenancy, and sell everything in NZ / store with parents I have no hard time constraint on this trip. I will have about $70K NZD saved up so won't have an issue money wise.

With the understanding Northern and Central Europe is going to be colder/wet around this time I thought I'd start my trip in Iberia working my way through southern France, northern Italy (incl Rome) and having a bit of a weeks 'break' in Split/Croatia. I was thinking the Iberia, France, Italy leg should be about a month, and the 'break' is on its own time schedule.

After the 'break' I want to start heading into central Europe. Start in Vienna, then Munich, Prague, and Berlin. I want to fit Krakow in too but might need to drop a city to do that. In the end I want to make way my way via Amsterdam and Paris up to London where I will stay for about a week before flying back to NZ. So fly into Lisbon or Madrid in Iberia then fly out London.

Also when I say 'at my own pace' here let me provide context: I have been looking into itineraries and have been trying to nail down a solid route to go. What I'm thinking though is I want to put together a general idea of a route which I will try stick to, but also let circumstances take me wherever. I don't know exactly how many days I want to spend everywhere, and I don't know who I will meet and what opportunities will come up. I also don't want to get burnt out, and I want to ensure I'm not jumping locations too quickly.

With that said I had a few questions I wanted to ask some other travellers:

1. Given the nature of my open-ended travel I am wondering if I should be buying a Eurrail pass or similar? I am worried about booking things too short notice and missing out or paying too much...
2. Same question as above but for hostels. What's the best practice here?
3. Any other tips?

backpacking,"Hey!  
Looking for an alround tent for me and my girlfriend. Have done some research and currently it appear to come down to the mountain hardwear mineral king 3 and nemo dagger 3p. Both are currently on sale at a store for roughly 160$ (Mineral King) and 350$ (Dagger).  
Short summary of my feelings at this point is that the Mineral King is good enough right now, but might get ""outdated"" if we want to go on longer hikes when we get more in to it.  
The nemo will probalby not be ""outdated"" as it has such a low weight and size, and as such a more allround choice. But the extra 200$ could be used on a new pack and/or sleeping-bag instead.  


I love the smartness of the bag separation for splitting weight on the dagger, or just simplifying weight distribution in my pack. But I'm a bit worried that there doesn't come a footprint with the dagger, and it seems quite hard (and expensive) to get a hold off. Anyone has experience with these tents? Are my durability concerns regarding the dagger just concerns? Anyone with anything else they would like to add? Or suggestions to other similarly priced options? With the dagger beeing 350$ I dont feel like the necessity to consider more expensive options than that, anyone who disagrees?  
About us: She has done quite a lot of car-camping, but not with packs more than day-trips. I have experience carrying heavy loads from my time in the army (30-40++ kg), so at first didn't consider a 3kg tent as a problem at all, but I do see a lot of backpackers stating that the biggest rookie mistake is to take to large/heavy gear and backpacks, and then downsizing fairly soon. We have just started to camp outside together on a couple of trips with hammocks. 

For now we do it for camping and appreciates luxury, but we dont have problem with walking to get to a nice camp-site. But not car camping as we like to get a little bit longer away from the road, and I don't think I would get the same nice ""camping"" feeling, as I get when we go into the woods. Doesn't have to be more than 500meters, although our last late night hammock trip ended up beeing 4-5km before we found a nice camp site. 

  
Can see us going for a hiking trip in the mountains over a week or so in the future (2-3 years +) if we dont have kids by then, so therefore wondering if we might end up having to by a new tent if we go for the Mineral King sooner than if we go for the dagger.

I will be needing a backpack, and as it is my first time I have a hard time picking the size. How big a pack will I need? I have found a pretty good offer on a Haglöfs Vyn 55, but is a 55l pack enough, or do I need a bit more?

backpacking,"Hi! I'm just here to rant about my backpacking dreams. A little backstory.

  
I'm a 27 year old man and for the past five years it has felt like my life has been put on hold, so to speak. When I was 22 I dropped out of uni and broke up with my girlfriend and as a result I catapulted myself into a deep pit of despair. I was depressed, aimless, and full of anxiety. I have been struggling a lot with loneliness too as I don't have much of a social life (I'm living on a secluded place where all of my friends have moved away to bigger cities). For the past years I have done a lot of work on myself, soul-searching if you will, and I'm an entirely different person today then I was back then. I am in fact doing quite well now, but I'm starting to grow impatient as of late.   


I'm starting to become thorougly tired of the work I do and I've come to realize I despise the place I'm living in. I'm desperate to try something completely new. I know I want to dedicate my life to something else, and for the last 4 years I've frantically searched for that something ""else"" and now I what it is; I want to quit this job I hate and go to explore the world and never work the same occupation again.  
If not this, what then? I just know I need a long break from everything and find my footing. If not this, I am just supremely confused what else to do. I just know I am deeply unhappy in my current living situation and I just know a change of scenery is urgently needed. I'm sick of trying to accept the situation for what it is, when what it is, is complete and utter shit. I feel so stuck and alienated from people around me. They are content with so little. I just have an insatiable thirst to experience life, you know? I have no responsibilities, no house, no partner. I can do this, but I'm afraid. Very few people understand. All I know is my enthusiasm for life is slowly dwindling and this is the only choice that fills me with hope.  


So the plan would be a very loose one; go Interrailing for a month in europe then backpack across asia for 6 months or so. I would have no plans for what I will do when I get home. Obviously it's reckless, but I am so utterly sick of playing life safe. I've been on three solo travel journeys in Europe already and each time I've had such a magical time, met lots of great people, made close friendships and experienced so much personal growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Vietnam:

I went to Central and Northen Vietnam last year. And for this year, I would like to travel to Dalat for its coffee plantation &amp; Phong Nha 4-6days caving expedition. In between, I am open to travel any places as long as it is not crowded at Hanoi or HCMC. However, I have already explored most of the places I want to visit in Vietnam and I will need to do more homework to find new places of interest btwn Dalat &amp; Phong Nha.

2) Laos/Cambodia:

I like to border cross btwn Laos &amp; Cambodia. Expenses are cheap &amp; affordable there &amp; I think I generally enjoy places that are relatively ""less travelled"" compared to the tourism giants within the Asia region like Japan/Korea &amp; etc. Hence, one of my travel destination. However, on the downside, I hate the hot &amp; humid weather.

3) China:

# Intro

Staying in a hostel provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity to interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds, make cherished international connections, broaden your understanding of the world, and realize the true smallness of our planet. It is an experience that can greatly broaden your horizons if you approach it with an open mind and a desire for personal and cultural growth.

In a hostel, you’ll be sharing a room with several individuals, with the rooms accommodating anywhere from 4 to 8 beds arranged in a bunk bed format. Guests typically stay for a period of 5 days to a week, although some choose to extend their stay for several months. As a result, you’ll be surrounded by a constantly rotating cast of characters, some of whom you’ll become friends with, while others may simply pass through.

You’ll meet some people who you exchange Instagram handles with, only to later forget each other’s account names, while others will become cherished foreign friends that you’ll keep in touch with and perhaps even reunite with in their home country or yours.

However, some guests may be noisy or untidy, making them poor roommates. For instance, someone who stays up late talking on the phone with family or a significant other can make it difficult to get a good night’s sleep, which can detract from their overall friendliness.

I wrote this to help you have some Ideas in mind about what you will encounter and also perhaps it puts a smile on your face and makes your day brighter. So let's get to it.

# 1- Bed Quakes

I’m sure you have some preconceived notions about what I’m about to describe, but let me provide a clear definition. These folks may appear normal and innocent at first glance or throughout their stay, but they can reveal their true, disruptive nature only to the unlucky guest who has the lower bunk. It typically unfolds like this: you go to bed, settle in, and are ready to fall asleep.

Everything seems peaceful and calm. Your eyes start to feel heavy as you drift off to sleep. But suddenly, after an hour or so, your peaceful slumber is interrupted by violent shaking of the bed, as if there were an earthquake happening. These artificially-induced quakes can last anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 seconds and can range from a magnitude of 5 to 10. You wake up, disoriented and frightened, before transitioning to an irritated state. You wait for the shaking to stop, hoping to return to sleep. If you’re lucky, you’ll eventually drift back off, but only for a a while until the shaking starts again. It’s thoughtless and inconsiderate to not take into account the well-being of the person sleeping below you. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to identify this type of roommate until you happen to sleep in the lower bunk. You’ll feel what horse play means by all means.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2- Plastic people

Are they made out of plastic? No but they have a strong fixation with plastic bags. Once you begin to notice that not a single hour goes by without them checking and rummaging through their plastic bags, it’s already too late. This behavior can last for several minutes or more, repeatedly waking you up during the night. They are often referred to as “plastic people” due to their excessive love towards plastic bags.

# 3- Runners

This type of person doesn’t enter the room like a ordinary person. They rush in, slamming the door open as if they’re being pursued by a group of one eyed demons. But don’t be fooled into thinking that this will be the end of it. If you think they will settle down after closing the door, you are greatly mistaken with your drowsy and bewildered eyes just opened. Most likely, they will return to the room to retrieve something from their locker, put on their shoes, change their clothes, and so on.

They will do so as if those demons that are chasing them will find their way into the room soon. They run around and try to pick up their stuff, Things drop out of their hands and they repeatedly say: Shit… Fuck… etc. You can either ask them politely to be quieter or wait until they finish and leave. However, they will likely repeat this behavior as they are always in a rush and tend to forget things, requiring multiple trips back to the room. This can be a frequent occurrence as I have personally experienced it several times with different runners.

# 4- Adventurer travelers

They are the type of travelers you want to meet. These people may be YouTubers, photographers, bloggers, or individuals with a wealth of cultural knowledge and a desire to expand their understanding of life through travel. Unlike strict disciplinarians, they are relaxed, keep themselves clean, have an awareness of their surroundings, are considerate of others, and are highly intelligent. They make for great traveling companions, with plenty of interesting stories to share and creative ideas for having fun.

# 5- Skunks

Having a skunk roommate is like being the victim of chemical weapons or being around a highly displeased skunk. They bring an unpleasant odor to the room, much like a skunk. These types of roommates can make the living space unbearable and uninviting.

For example, I once had a roommate who was a serious cyclist and also happened to be a legit skunk. He never took showers, never washed his clothes or towel, and let the towel stink like a landfill. It hung on his bed, giving off an odor so potent, you’d think a skunk had taken up residency. It was a nightly battle, having to endure that stench while trying to get some shut-eye. Talk about a nightmare before bedtime.

He unload his gut like he’s hosting a celebration of puking up boiled eggs. Even while he was sitting in the lobby, I knew he was there just by the pungent odor of a rotting body that permeated the air before I even entered the lobby. Anyways, I slept in the lobby until the day he left. He stayed for 4 days and, I must say, he was the worst person I encountered during my travels.

# 6- Expanders

They begin by hanging their towel and clothes on top of their bed, eventually taking up all the space. Their open suitcase is on the ground and their belongings are scattered around it. You’ll find yourself stumbling over their things on the floor as you try to reach your own bed. They don’t think twice about bringing all their food and drinks and placing them near their bed. If they’re on the lower bunk and the top bunk is empty, they’ll use it to hang even more items, while still keeping an eye on your side of the room and its empty top bunk.

They behave like they’ve just won the jackpot in a game show and now they’re the proud owners of everything in sight! Even the common fridge is not safe from their territorial instincts. They’ll keep taking over more and more space, like a balloon on a hot air vent. They expand and expand if they see no needle around.

# 7- Podcasters

Once I had two roommates who started chatting at 8 PM. It was okay, nobody was in a hurry to sleep. I, however, had things to do, so I went to the lobby for a few hours and returned around 12. To my surprise, they were still talking, in their native language. To avoid any kind of conflict, I left for the lobby again. When I returned at 2:20 AM, they were still at it. I spoke with the night shift manager and had a conversation with them as well

They finally stopped speaking, but the fact that they didn’t care about the time or whether others were trying to sleep was a concerning issue. One of them was quite attached to his plastic bag. He had a deep love for it, much like some grandmothers have for their possessions. He would randomly search through it, not caring about the time or if others were sleeping.

""What time is it? Are others sleeping?"" These were questions he asked himself, but always answered with a dismissive “Fuck them"".

# 8- Serial poopers

Here they come! You’re living your life in the hostel, enjoying your time while everything is cool. But suddenly, the word is out: a Serial Pooper is on the loose! People are running around in a panic, looking worried and stressed out. It’s like a scene straight out of a horror movie, with everyone wondering “Who will be the next victim?”

Apparently, there’s a new guest at the hostel who seems to have a knack for leaving their mark, or should I say “stains,” around the toilets. I’ve witnessed the aftermath of their bathroom antics, with poop stains on the toilet paper holder, walls, and even door handles. And it doesn’t end with just one toilet. They move from one to the next, rendering each one useless in a matter of hours. Just imagine trying to use a toilet that has poop smears on the seat, door handle, and toilet paper holder. Not a pleasant sight

Most people prefer to suffer or go out and find another toilet instead of going into this poopy nightmare. You may wonder what these serial poopers look like, and what kind of people they are. I’ve encountered some during my travels and let me tell you, they’re just like you and me… except for their toilet habits. They could be charming and charismatic, but little do you know, they’re just hiding their true “brown” colors.

# 9- The classic “I don’t like it here, I want to go back” folks

Meet the ‘Homesick Hearts’ — they repeat their lament of “I don’t like it here, I wanna go back” multiple times a day. Yet, they’re still here months later. Perhaps they’re running from something back home, be it cultural, political or financial issues. Or maybe they’re searching for a new place to call home. Either way, it’s hard to fault them for having those issues.

They simply need to find refuge in another country and a stay in a hostel is preferable to renting a room or house. Hostels offer a clean and organized environment, as the cleaning staff ensures that the facilities are kept tidy. If they can locate a well-maintained hostel with an affordable rate, they will likely make it their permanent residence. However, the negative aspect of this type of personality is that they tend to be unhappy and uneasy. Some may be unable to leave the hostel due to depression, financial difficulties, or fear of being apprehended by authorities. Others may not have financial concerns and may engage in partying, but they still complain 24/7 and have a negative view of the country they are staying in.

# 10- Potential Future CEOs

This one is interesting. You likely want to associate with them. They are diligent and have both short-term and long-term aspirations. They can often be found working late into the night in the lobby, putting in long hours to reach their goals. They might own a company located in another nation or be working on a startup endeavor.

They are excellent conversationalists and make great friends. I met one such person who still remains a close friend of mine. He abstains from alcohol, opts for healthy food and drinks, and has a patient and understanding demeanor towards different situations and individuals. He is also eager to discover the city’s historical marvels. We occasionally arrange tea parties, where we invite guests to try different types of tea while relaxing to some soothing spiritual music and engaging in lively discussions.

# 11- Spies

Imagine you’re staying in a hostel in Mexico during the time of the Ukrainian invasion. A Russian man enters, fluent in English like a native speaker. He is highly sociable and loves to chat. He tells you that he used to be in the Russian army but got out a few months ago. He mentions his mother is Mexican, but whenever you ask about her, he brushes it off, saying she immigrated many years ago and doesn’t like to talk about Mexico. He stays at the hostel for over a month. As an American staying at the same hostel, you might feel like you’re being watched, and catch glimpses of him checking out your room when you’re not there and have left the door open.

Over time, as people grew more suspicious of him and bombarded him with constant questions, he finally confessed that he was still in the army. He explained that his stay in Mexico was arranged with the government and that he checked in with the Russian embassy daily. He had no Mexican mother, and his mission was simply to gather some minor information. This was a lot for the average traveler to take in, but it’s clear that hostels, as international gathering places, provide a perfect opportunity for spies to gather information about people from different countries, neighboring nations, and the country they’ve traveled to as a let’s “tourist”.

It’s unsettling, isn’t it?

# 12- Partier

They are the stuff of legend for their all-day sleeping and all-night partying ways. Bar-hopping is their favorite pastime and hanging out with them will guarantee you a wild ride. They are one of the most recommended groups of people to spend time with, and trust us, it’s worth it. Just be prepared to temporarily embrace your inner night owl and say goodbye to your regular sleep schedule. With them, you’ll make a ton of new friends and create memories to last a lifetime. Just make sure to pace yourself and stay hydrated, because these party animals don’t slow down until the sun comes up!

# 13- Elephant in the room

They can be great individuals. In fact, the ones I’ve encountered were usually humble and kind, with the unfortunate side effect of being snorers. Of course, it’s not their fault, but it’s not easy for others either. After a long day, a strenuous walk, or a tour of another city, you want nothing more than a good night’s rest, but the loud snoring of your roommate can make that impossible. The sound is so loud, it’s as if they’re shouting, and no amount of earplugs or headphones can block it out, not even with the soothing sounds of meditation music.

I once experienced this myself. I was sharing a dorm room with three other people and it felt like there was an elephant in the room… an extremely loud screaming elephant that couldn’t be ignored at all! We had no choice but to abandon our beds and sleep in the lobby. The next day, I had a chat with the snorer and, much to my surprise, they were actually one of the coolest people I met in that hostel. It was a classic case of “daytime friends, nighttime foes”.

# 14- Call center agents

They are the ones you never see without their phone in hand. Not just checking their messages or scrolling through their Instagram feed, but constantly on a call, occupying the same seat in the lobby and speaking in a language only they seem to understand. No matter what time of day you enter the lobby, there they are, seated in the same spot, their butt shape molded into the cushion, steadfastly holding their phone and deeply engaged in the front-line of their phone calls. It’s as if they’ve taken a vow to never let go of that seat, or their phone for that matter.

It’s actually an ugly scene, but it can look like like a dramatic soap opera playing out in real life! And all over a phone call. These people are truly masters of multitasking, juggling their phone conversation with making exaggerated hand gestures, slamming the table, and even throwing in a good shout and cuss word here and there. Bystanders can’t help but learn a few new words in their native language, even if they don’t want to.

# 15- No vital sign people

This kind of person can be a man child sitting in a corner playing games. Can be some one working with his lap top. An IT specialist or a freelancer or just some one who didn't find his home a good place to check his Instagram stories so he’s come to a hostel in another country and never get his eyes off of his phone, while he is in the hostel.

They’re like ghosts haunting the lobby, but instead of spooky noises, you hear the sound of rapid mouse clicks and the occasional outburst of frustration at an in-game defeat. You try to offer them a snack or say hello, but they just nod their head and continue on with their virtual world, completely oblivious to the real world around them. The only time they resurface from their gaming trance is when it’s time to retire to their room for the night, leaving their laptop behind like a security blanket. And the next day, they’re back at it again, butt in chair, hand on mouse, eyes glued to the screen. It’s a never-ending cycle of game, sleep, game, sleep.

We are starting in London and are planning on taking trains south and east to Paris, Switzerland, Munich, Salzburg, and Vienna. We were going to fly from Vienna to Istanbul but now I am wondering if it would be worth taking trains instead so we can see more of the region by land. I think it would be so cool to be able to say that we traveled all the way from London to Istanbul via train.

We would take a train from Vienna to Budapest and that part seems pretty easy. But I am getting stuck on figuring out what the best way to get from Budapest to Istanbul would be. Would it be better to go through Romania (via Bucharest) or through Serbia (via Sofia)? Or something else? Or better to just fly? We have about a week in our itinerary that we could devote to getting from Budapest to Istanbul so we could stop overnight in some of the cities along the way. Or if we fly we would just spend more time in Budapest and more time in Istanbul.

I am seeing something online about the Bosphorus express from Bucharest to Istanbul - does anyone have experience with that?

backpacking,"**The Route**

* Having handed in my work devices on Friday 11th February 2022 I was on a plane Monday 14th and landed in Tijuana, Baja California by Tuesday 15th. My plan was a simple one; to travel south, avoiding planes where possible, and to see how far I’d get with the time (&amp; budget!) available, exploring the points of interest which piqued my curiosity most. My reasoning for selecting this part of the world was also relatively straightforward; I have family there, and while I’d visited for short periods previously, I’d not done so solo nor for such an extended period of time. In the end the trip was to take me through 10 countries, over 60 separate locations and as far as Quilotoa, an extinct volcano now with a lake in the former crater, a couple of hours south of Quito, Ecuador.

**Highlights**

* **La Huasteca Potosina, Mexico.** About 6 hours’ drive north-east from Mexico City located in the state of San Luis Potosí La Huasteca Potosina is an area of outstanding natural beauty dotted with turquoise coloured waterfalls and rivers. Far from the much more renown Yucatán or Pacific coasts this region is entirely unafflicted by tourist overcrowding and also unexpectedly home to a British cultural contribution, the surrealist garden of Edward James, “La Pozas”. A wealthy and eccentric aristocrat James considered the natural environment to lend itself to a surrealist style and began construction of the garden in 1948, aiming for the structures to blend in with the landscape and numerous orchids and other plants housed there. Construction ceased in 1984 with his passing and underway structures were deliberately left incomplete, further enhancing the surrealist feel.
* **El Mirador, El Petén, Guatemala.** While Tikal is certainly the best known and most restored Mayan site in this north-eastern region of Guatemala, it is far from the only one. Indeed, it is estimated that there are more than 1500 ruins in the region, with evermore being discovered and recovered from the jungle thanks to LIDAR technology. El Mirador (“the lookout”), still actively being worked on by Richard Hansen’s archeological team from the University of Idaho, is one such site and requires a full 5 or 6 days to visit. Significantly older than Tikal it is in fact best described as a network of ruins as opposed to a sole ruin, with structures dating from as far back as 1000 BC to as recent as 250 AD. Aside from the archeological and historical interest of the site, there’s also plenty of flora and fauna to observe – and watch out for - in the heart of the jungle. While like many a prior Western visitor I was initially confused by the guides’ choice of jeans for a hot and humid climate on active days the reasoning became more apparent after sighting three snakes, two of which were venomous, within 24 hours.
* **El Castillo, Nicaragua.** At my first stop in Nicaragua, the colonial city of León, I'd picked up a Lonely Planet for the country and noted the opportunity to get a little more off the beaten track, away from the well-trodden path along the pan-American highway on the Pacific side. This included the opportunity to wander down the San Juan river, which essentially marks the southern border with Costa Rica. From Ometepe, an island formed from two volcanoes, then, I hopped on one of the twice weekly overnight ferries to San Carlos, a town at the point where lake Ometepe flows out into the river. Arriving at San Carlos early in the morning I had a brief look around before continuing along on a separate boat down the river to El Castillo. A tiny village built on the riverfront it feels, even more than much of Nicaragua, like a step back in time with no cars, motorbikes or other vehicles in sight. In addition to being stunningly located in the heart of the jungle it also has a storied history due to its importance as a strategic defensive location along the river due to its proximity to some natural rapids. Indeed, its name, ""the castle"", is due to the Spanish colonial fort located there, and which over the centuries was the site of numerous conflicts including a successful siege by a 22 year-old Captain Horatio Nelson in 1780.
* **Travelling from Panama to Colombia by catamaran.** With the Darién gap being one of the most inhospitable environments in the region  due to the natural conditions, let alone the human factors, there are surprisingly few options to make the journey from Panama across to South America, and vice versa. And with no commercial ferry service running there are in fact only 2 (legal) options: to fly or by boat. Enjoying the luxury of time I therefore selected the latter option, a full 5 day trip by catamaran with another 15 or so passengers, a Captain and his first mate (and also wife!). While the open sea portion of the journey was to only take around 30 hours the real highlight of the trip is prior to this (if going north to south) when exploring the San Blas islands off the coast of Panama, home to the indigenous Guna Yala. An archipelago of 378 islands, the majority are uninhabited and pristinely maintained with the Guna protecting the area from any further development.

**Lowlights**

* **Getting sick.** Having had a seemingly trouble free first few months I eventually fell to the inevitable stomach illness any backpacker can anticipate on a less familiar diet in another part of the world. Less pleasant was the suspected case of Covid I had when in a small town in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Attempting to get hold of a test also brought home the challenge many in the region would’ve had during the pandemic, as I soon found both of the only pharmacies in the town were out of stock. Further, at a subsequent enquiry elsewhere I was to discover a lateral flow test cost 250 MXN pesos (almost £11!), slightly more than the daily minimum wage.
* **Driving standards.** Suffice to say, the quality of roads, adherence to speed limits and general driving standards were fairly variable throughout the countries I passed through, with Guatemala and Colombia particularly involving some rather interesting and bumpy trips. A quick google of some driving statistics does in fact appear to validate this perception, with the former ranking the 8th worst country globally for road traffic deaths, and the latter the 3rd worst for road quality!
* … almost nothing else apart from that!

**Unexpected Gem**

* **Nicaragua.** The second-poorest country in the Western hemisphere after Haiti, Nicaragua is also one of the long-standing leftist regimes in the regime and once more under the presidency of Daniel Ortega, one of the original revolutionaries of the 1979 Sandinista revolution which overthrew the USA-backed Somoza regime. This unique political and social climate is not hidden from view, with stencils displaying iconography of the revolutionary state aplenty in cities such as León. Stark examples would include ones such as that of Sandino (the original 1930s revolutionary) with the heel of his boot atop the hat of a literally downtrodden Uncle Sam. Aside from that the country is also host to spectacular biodiversity yet often overshadowed by its southern neighbour, Costa Rica, which takes all those plaudits.

**Most Unexpected Moments**

* **Hurricane Agatha.** Having grown up in the climatic and natural safe-haven of the UK I’d always considered natural disasters and extreme weather events to be almost abstract occurrences and not something I’d ever experience myself. This was to quickly change last May when the predicted trajectory for a brewing hurricane rapidly changed from a forecast landfall 80km away to directly at the town of Mazunte where I found myself at the time. The strongest Pacific hurricane to make landfall in the month of May since records began, it fortunately failed to reach Category 3 status, but was certainly strong enough for my liking as a Category 2 with 1 minute sustained winds of 110mph. Safely ensconced in a rented room in the centre of town, and with all power having cut in the early stages, there was no option but to sit things out and listen to the torrential rains and wind, and hope the taped-up windows would hold strong! While a novel experience for myself, it also served to bring to life the realities of a world in which atypical weather events outside their expected windows, may, in fact, start to become rather more typical.

**Most Budget Friendly** 

* **Nicaragua.** With it easy enough to find a hostel for under $10 a night and sometimes for as little as $5 it’s certainly a backpacker and budget friendly destination. And with £1 exchanging for 40 Nicaraguan Córdobas, it’s also relatively easy to eat well with a reasonable meal around the 150 córdobas mark.
* **Colombia.** While unfortunately one of the emerging markets with a currency which devalued most in 2022, falling 16% against the dollar, this of course makes it a more inviting destination for outsiders. Further, with a security situation that has markedly improved over the years and a second peace treaty in the works following on from the 2016 agreement, it’s an ideal destination for a restricted budget.

**Most Family Friendly** 

* **Costa Rica.** Probably the most well-known of the Central American countries, it’s for good reason, with some of the most accessible flora and fauna you’ll find anywhere in the world. Particular highlights and examples of this include the Manuel Antonio nature park on the pacific coast where you can wander wooden boarding among the canopy spotting sloths, spider monkeys and toucans, and see where the jungle meets the sea.
* **Guatemala.** Nestled below Mexico, Guatemala offers the perfect blend of coast, volcanoes, jungle and history. While not a complete stranger to violent troubles, including in the not too distant past, it’s now considered one of the steadier countries in the region with the colonial-style city of Antigua safe to wander at all times of day and night.

**Most Interesting Animal Spotted**

* **Oncilla.** Of the six cat species native to Panama (the others being the jaguar, cougar, ocelot, jaguarundi &amp; margay) this was the only one I hadn’t heard of, yet to be the only one I’d spot live in the flesh.

backpacking,"Hey,

I started traveling in October 2019 and I came back home in December 2022. I started a 1 year travel that ended up lasting 3 years.

Since I came back i've been here and there to visit family and friends that I haven't seen for that long.

But now, it's weird. I'm not feeling unhappy, but I'm litteraly going to bed at 9am and waking up a 6pm.

It's like I was avoiding doing stuff here, I'm not interested in finding a job right away, or going back to the ""normal life"" anytime soon.

I mean, I could do it, but I'm not interested at all.

Before traveling I was a geek; and during thoses 3 years I haven't played a single video game. Now that I am back I'm just playing all night and smoking weed, because i just couldn't do that during the travel.

I'm happy not to be on the road again, I wanted a break from thoses night bus, meeting people everyday, forcing yourself to do stuff everyday. I'm enjoying my break.

But somehow, I'm wondering if it's not the famous ""Return Depresssion"" that is hiting me without me noticing it.

I'm also worried because i'm living at my mother's place and since I came back everyone is asking her what i'm doing right now and what are my plans. She has a tough life and I don't think she is very pleased answering that I do nothing and have no plan for the future.

backpacking,"A backpacker is a type of traveler who prioritizes budget and adventure over luxury. They are known for carrying everything they need on their back, as they travel from one place to another. Backpacking is a popular way to see the world for those who are seeking new experiences and want to immerse themselves in different cultures.

**Types of Backpackers**There are several different types of backpackers, each with their own unique travel style. Here are some of the most common types:

1. **Budget Backpacker:** As the name suggests, budget backpackers prioritize cost savings over comfort and convenience. They typically stay in budget accommodations such as hostels and camping sites, and eat at local markets or street vendors.
2. **Adventure Backpacker:** Adventure backpackers are thrill-seekers who are always on the lookout for new challenges and experiences.

&gt;Traveling is one of life's greatest pleasures, but it can also be expensive. However, with a bit of creativity and resourcefulness, it is possible to make money while on the road. Whether you are traveling for work or for leisure, there are several ways you can turn your travels into a source of income. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. **Freelance Work:** With the rise of remote work, it has become easier than ever to make money while traveling. If you have a skill such as writing, graphic design, or programming, you can offer your services to clients around the world through freelance platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer. This way, you can work from anywhere with an internet connection and earn a steady income while exploring new destinations.
2. **Online Teaching:** If you are proficient in a particular subject or language, you can offer tutoring or language lessons online through websites such as iTalki or Verbling. You can earn money while sharing your knowledge with students from around the world.

We enjoy tent camping and recently bought a tent camper to make camping with small children (18 mo &amp; expecting #2) easier, but we don't see the camper as a forever thing. I'm taking my time to learn about backpacking so I can help equip our family when the time comes for us to try it, but I'm starting from a knowledge base of 0. Some questions I have:

1. How to even start if you've never done it before?
2. What age is reasonable to expect your children to be able to handle even an overnight trip?
3. What rules/regulations, if any, are there around backpacking?
4. What unspoken code of conduct rules are common among backpackers?
5. How do you go to the bathroom?
6. How do you get safe water?
7. How do you keep yourself and supplies safe from predators in areas without trees or bear poles?
8. Would something like kayak or canoe camping, where you can potentially carry more gear, be a good way to ease into it (and easier on little feet)?

Don't have a defined duration but will be there for multiple months hopefully. I'm planning to do hiking and camping, including multi day treks, as well as just everyday travel.

Obviously I know bottled water is a simple solution when not hiking but I'd like to try to be a bit more waste-friendly and use filtered tap water and re-usable bottles if possible.

1. Lots of people posting in other discussions about similar topics say they get some kind of filter which only filters bacteria/protozoa/particulate and then tablets as back up, but the filters won't get rid of viruses so surly the tablets should be essential, not back up? Although I presume they mean back up in case something hairband to their filter. So my next question is...
2. How concerned should I be about viruses in those areas? Does anyone know if any info online  specifically about risks in particular areas? I've had a little look but couldn't find anything specific. I'm familiar with all the time/health/taste concerns/cons that people have with purifier tablets/drops, and I'm assuming that people just weigh that against the risk of getting a virus? 

I guess what I'm ultimately asking in an unnecessarily long winded way is should I be purifying water all the time if I don't use bottled water, instead of just filtering?

One of my coworkers told me that one of her friends applied for an Australian work visa and got accepted quite promptley. I applied that night and got accepted a few days later! So now i've quit my job and have a flight out to Melbourne come late February. I would like to travel for at least 6 months, but i have O plans other than backpack Australia for a few months, then Asia and hopefully Europe for a bit. I have a few questions and if there are any experienced backpackers here, i would LOVE some advice.

1. Is it bad that I sort of know what I want to do, but have absolutely no concrete plans? Should I be booking hostels 3-4 weeks in advance, or will i be okay booking a bed 1 week in advance? I feel like lots of travelers know exactly where they want to stay, what they want to see, and what the want to do. Like i said I have a few dreams of what I what to do, but no plans whatso ever. 

2. Im staying at the Space Hotel for the first week, then i was thinking about Europa the next week Europa is a little cheaper than the Space Hotel, but both are still a bit pricey ($40-$42USD a night). I wanted to stay in the CBD area for the first two weeks, but then i like the idea of getting a hostel closer to the beach. Im a surfer and would LOVE to stay in a hostel closer to a great surfing beach in Melbourne, so if anyone knows of any hostels that are located near a good surf break and that are clean, safe, cheaper, and backpacker friendly, let me know!

3. I love the idea of driving from Melbourne to Byron Bay. If I were to do this at a slow pace, bouncing from surf break to surf break over the course of 3-4 weeks, do you think i should buy a beater car or rent a car. My budget for renting a car would be about $40-$50 USD a day.

Spacious enough for my 6 foot self

Light enough. I'm not a gram weenie and I'll be using this for bikepacking mostly

One of my coworkers told me that one of her friends applied for an Australian work visa and got accepted quite promptley. I applied that night and got accepted a few days later!

So now i've quit my job and have a flight out to Melbourne come late February. I would like to travel for at least 6 months, but i have 0 plans other than backpack Australia for a few months, then Asia and Europe for a bit.  I have a few questions and if there are any experienced backpackers here, i would LOVE some advice.

1.  Is it bad that I sort of know what i want to do, but have absolutely no concrete plans?  Should I be booking hostels 3-4 weeks in advance, or will i be okay booking a bed 1 week in advance?
2. Im staying at the Space Hotel for the first week, then i was thinking about Europa the next week. Europa is a little cheaper than the Space Hotel, but both are still a bit pricey.  I wanted to stay in the CBD area for the first two weeks, but then i like the idea of getting a hostel closer to the beach. Im a surfer and would LOVE to stay in a hostel closer to a great surfing beach in Melbourne, so if anyone knows of any hostels that are clean, safe, cheaper, and backpacker friendly, let me know!
3. I love the idea of driving from Melbourne to Byron Bay. If I were to do this at a slow pace, bouncing from surf break to surf break over the course of 3-4 weeks, do you think i should buy a beater car or rent a car. My budget for renting a car would be about $40-$50 USD a day.

Then today I noticed a (hopefully gently) used mid-temp goose down North Face in an EBay auction. It appears to be in great shape. Seller says no stains or damage. And the price was good. I'm crossing my fingers. 

...only now I just noticed it was a left-hand zipper bag! 

So then I recalled this comment from 20 years ago. Is that a thing? Obviously, LHZ can be zipped to another bag for couples to sleep under the covers together, and I'm single. But, what If I was left handed person? Wouldn't that be a good reason for a LHZ bag?",Does a left-hand zipper sleeping bag signify something to travelers?,,xtiansimon,,0,2023-02-06 02:08:11

* Visas -- which should I book/apply for in advance?
* Vaccines -- are any mandatory?
* Gear
   * Backpack size -- is 30L enough? Too big/small?
   * Clothes/shoes -- Mainly packing shorts/t-shirts/flowy button downs, should I bring pants/jackets/hoodies?
* Travel insurance -- Worth it? I plan on getting my PADI (scuba diving) license as well
* Medicine/toiletries -- what is a must and what can I buy there to save some room?

backpacking,"My wife doesn't really wear makeup, and she's not bring a ton of shoes or dresses or anything, but I'm just kind of shocked how different our weight is for what is, some face cleaning products and menstrual related items?

&amp;#x200B;

This is for 2 weeks in Ecuador, involving a 3-day hike (staying at hostels, no tents needed and able to dry/rinse clothes, eat dinner, and shower each day), and then a few days diving and at the beach. So we do need cold+warm weather gear. 

&amp;#x200B;

My pack weight is about 11 pounds. Roughly, that is with 

* 1 pair of pants, worn
* 1 pair of shorts, 
* Multiple shirts
   * 1 tanktop
   * 1 hiking long sleeve
   * 1 fleece long sleeve
* 3 pairs of socks (+ 1 worn)
* 2 pairs underwear, 1 pair of hiking underwear
* 1 small towel
* \~6000 calories worth of snacks for both of us
* Rain paints + rain jacket (we have same lightweight pair)
* Both of our toothbrushes/toothpaste, our shampoo and bodywash

So again, my weight is \~ 11 pounds while I'm carrying all of our food and hygeine/cleaning products, and hers rang in \~ 18 pounds! 

I went through her pack with her, didn't weigh each individual item or anything, she had two pairs of hiking pants, we got rid of one, a hiking shirt for each day, we got rid of the heaviest one, her face cleaning products were still all in the original glass containers so we put just what she needs into ziploc baggies, afterwards she is down to \~16 pounds, but I'm still kind of shocked.

&amp;#x200B;

We still need to carry water, I'll have the majority of that anyway but I want to help her as much as possible. If any of you have a lighterpack I'd love to see it!

&amp;#x200B;

I'll keep grabbing stuff to lower her weight, but we are going to be hitting almost 13,000 ft elevation/4000m on our hike so I really wanted to minimize both our weights to avoid any altitude problems.","Women travel backpackers, what is your typical base weight?

backpacking,"I've got a good few backpacking trips under my belt now, and last September my partner joined me for her first trip. We went for a fairly short journey to Talapus Lake in Washington. My partner suffers from chronic migraines and unfortunately got one going up the trail. By the time we reached the day area of the lake, they were just about ready to vomit and bail. To add to the suffering, they stepped on a hornet nest on our way to the camp spot and got stung 7 times. It was about 2 am when they were feeling better and did some stargazing with me. The following day went well, and we got back without issues. The weather was great at 70-75 Fahrenheit, with clear skies and low wind on both days. 

Overall it wasn't the worst experience, but the main kicker for my partner was the migraine. Factors she thought might have made it for her might have been not hydrating enough before the hike, the strain of the exercise, and eating a heavy meal beforehand. She drank ample water and took migraine pills to mitigate it, but didn't have much effect. We're training a bit, and bringing electrolyte supplements for our next venture.

I've always wanted to go backpacking but life kind of got into the way, met someone (who judged backpacking...) when I was young,.soon started a family... now I'm 41,  divorced and my teens have their own plans over the summer... which means that my time to shine has come.

Is Malta popular around backpackers my age? 

From what I could gather while researching, the only campground on the island isn't great, but those reviews are 3 years old... so has anyone recently gone?

As I know 2 weeks is a little long for Malta, do you have any suggestions of destinations to go to which aren't too far away?

This kind of seems like a no brainer for me but maybe I’m missing something. In the past I’ve just brought light weight shorts to wear over the base bottoms that double as swimming trunks but this trip I won’t be swimming.

2nd week I may venture up into the mountains if Im feeling it or possibly I may fly to the big island for the week to camp and hike. I read the temps and weather in the mountains can vary a lot on the big island. What are nightime mountain temps like on Oahu?

I am torn between packing for an east coast USA winter trip (to cover my ass) or a fall east coast trip. I have a 19 degree down bag and a 30 degree synthetic quilt. Id rather bring the quilt and some sleep layers.

backpacking,"Good Morning,

A few buddies and I have a trip planned for Yosemite June 19-22. We have a permit, etc. However, due to the snow this year I thought it might be a good idea to have a backup plan in case Tioga Rd is not open yet when we go.

Our plan is to go to the Tuolumne of the Grand Canyon from White Wolfe to Tuolumne and do that hike in 4 days.  However, in recent years Tioga Rd ( the road to get the White Wolf) have not been open by June 19.  I was considering trying to get a permit for the Hetch Hetchy loop for that same time frame, but I am not sure if snow closures would still be an issue there.

Does anyone have any loop trail ideas outside of Yosemite Nat Park around 25-35 miles that would most likely be doable during a high snow year?  My buddies and I are all in our upper 50's and have all backpacked before.  I have already looked at Rae Lakes Loop ( no permits available) the lost coast trail ( no permits available).

backpacking,"Are you looking for the top reasons why sports are important for us? If so, this popular blog post is the perfect read for you. Here, we’ll take a look at the five key reasons why sports are necessary for us, and how they can help us lead better lives. Keep reading to learn more!

**1) They keep us physically active**

Sports are a great way to stay physically active. With the help of regular physical activity, we can keep our bodies healthy and strong. According to the American Heart Association, physical activity helps us to maintain a healthy weight and reduce our risk of heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions. Additionally, physical activity releases endorphins that can elevate mood and reduce stress. 

As part of a regular fitness routine, participating in sports can help you stay in shape, increase your endurance and strength, and boost your overall health. Whether you choose to play on a team or work out solo, engaging in some form of physical activity is one of the best blog tips you can use to take care of your body.

**2) They teach us teamwork**

One of the most important aspects of [sports](https://www.popularblogtips.com/) is that they teach us the value of teamwork. Working together as a team and achieving success can be one of the most rewarding experiences, and it’s something that can be learned through sports. Teamwork teaches us how to work together to achieve a common goal and become a better team in the process. This can be applied to all areas of life and can help us form strong relationships with others. In this increasingly digital world, many of us are stuck inside with little social interaction, making it even more important to practice teamwork so that we can better understand how to collaborate with others. According to a popular blog, “When we engage in team sports, we learn valuable lessons about communication, cooperation, and problem-solving. We learn how to work with others, to respect their opinions, to trust their judgment, and to compromise when necessary.” These valuable skills will stay with us forever and help us become better people.

**3) They help us relieve stress**

One of the most [popular blog](https://www.popularblogtips.com/) topics in recent years has been mental health, and rightfully so. Stress is something that many of us experience on a daily basis, and can have a detrimental effect on our physical and emotional wellbeing. Fortunately, engaging in physical activity like sports can be a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. Participating in sports can give us a sense of purpose, while also providing an outlet for our frustrations and worries. The physical activity helps to release endorphins, which can lift our mood and help us to feel better. Additionally, engaging in a team sport allows us to make friends and build strong relationships, which can also help us to cope with stress in a healthy way.",The top 5 reasons why sports are necessary for us,,popularblogtips,,0,2023-02-03 04:24:49

so. any advice on if i should actually “backpack” (use a backpack as my luggage) or should i invest in a rolling carry on? i think both have their pros and cons…

the rolling carry on seems VERY cumbersome if/WHEN i have to navigate steps.

backpacking,"If I get roasted it’s fine, I’ve already been through hell it can’t be any worse. Has anyone ever made an absolute tragedy of a decision backpacking and it ruined their entire trip?

I backpacked the WCT with an ex-coworker who was also a part of my friend group, though we never built a friendship. I’ve kept up with her social media after we both moved on to better jobs, she regularly posts her solo adventures. She wanted to go on a group trip right before she got married and when I heard it was going to be a challenge, I impulsively said yes. She picked out the dates which would give us four days on the trail and I was concerned about it because online says most people take 5-7 days. She told me it was fine, we would just have to grind out the miles and all we had to do was 10 miles a day. Worried I wouldn’t be able to keep up with the group, I started training pretty seriously. I get airline tickets, permits and everything and everyone in the group (including her fiancé) drops out except her. I tried my hardest to start building a friendship but I couldn’t help but feel like all my attempts were met with snarky replies. For instance, when I texted her photos of me training with my pack she replied with “I HIGHLY suggest you get actual rain proof gear”. I asked if she was training to try and see if I was up to par but it became clear she wasn’t planning on training with her pack because she was doing cross-fit classes 5 days of the week. She tells me her fiancé is alluding to the fact she may have to carry me through the trail. He has done the trail before and I didn’t want to hold her back so I trained harder.

We get on the trail and it is pretty clear from the start she is not physically prepared whatsoever. The first five miles takes us almost the entire day. It’s starting to get dark and she’s getting cold and worried but also wants to keep taking breaks and is walking EXTREMELY slow (my boyfriend looked at my GoPro data and we were averaging .5 miles/hour) We are in the rainforest and there isn’t an ideal spot to set up camp, it’s also prohibited. She starts saying she thinks she’s hypothermic. I realize that she is sweating underneath her jacket and tell her to change into a dry shirt so she’s not chilled underneath. She doesn’t like my solution and insists on letting her damp shirt air dry on her body with her jacket off because she didn’t pack a lot of clothes. I ask if she needs a medivac or to set up camp right where we were and she declines both. I try to push her through the breaks that she keeps wanting to take (I don’t know if this was right or not) but she’s getting increasingly upset about it getting dark and cold and the only solution I can think of is getting to camp as soon as possible. I give her my dinner since it was just bars while her food had to be cooked because she keeps saying she’s starving and I think some calories will help her. We finally make it to camp in the pitch black, I had to pull both of us and our packs across the trolley car because she is too tired. I’m on a tight schedule because I’m starting a new job when I get back to town and I have someone watching my dogs so I can’t really comfortably extend the time I’m on trail and I am now concerned about what I’ve gotten myself into.

The next morning I wake up to hearing her talking to a few other backpackers. They are stressing to her that taking breaks and time to eat lunch is essential and that we did the hardest 10 miles of the trail that nobody does in one single day. There is a guy that everyone is fan-girling over calling the mayor of the trail. He asks her about me and she says I am still in my tent. When I get out of my tent and pack up he seemed to make a point to speak to everyone but me, he just glared at me and left. This may have not been at purpose at all, I can admit I already felt like my teammate may have been making things out like I was the bad guy even though she decided to do 10 miles a day.

Day 2 she starts off by saying we may just have to buy new return flights and extend our time there. I can’t afford dishing out another $600 when I’ve already spent well over 1k on gear, tickets, permits etc. her fiancé makes a lot of money and paid for the majority of her trip but I am on a single income and supporting me and my four dogs. I can’t help but feel some resentment. I feel like I put in the work to train, put in all of this money and it’s not fair to expect me to dish out more money because she refused to practice especially when she picked the time frame. The situation is awkward but there’s a halfway point on the trail and I decide that if this gets bad enough I can tell her we can split or I can get her to the half way mark so she can get off.  She is making the worst faces and sounds possible. I only had one pair of dry socks that she wants to use because both her pairs are wet, but other than my spare mine are all wet as well. She refuses to climb any ladders carrying her hiking poles, refuses to read the map but is constantly asking me how many more kilometers, is even asking me frequently to pull her shirt down in the back. She made her own meals and all of her food must be jet boiled for a long time but there are no open flames allowed in the forest. She is asking for breaks on average probably every five minutes, complaining that she doesn’t want to get to camp late like we did last night, walking the speed of a glacier and upset because she is hungry. I don’t know what to do I am trying my best, Reddit. I was cheated on not that long ago and was left feeling like I had no value. I was thinking this was going to be my trip to remember I am strong and capable. I put so much into it, I’m in this gorgeous place so far from home and I feel like I can’t enjoy my time. She is in pain and at the briefing we were told if someone in the group gets rescued another person has to accompany them which would immediately end my trip. I start to worry if she injures herself because she isn’t prepared, how able am I to carry both of our loads?  She refused to pack lightly and her pack is 55lbs, mine is 35lbs and I weigh 110lbs. She is pushing herself to do something above her skill and I feel like it’s asking for an injury. I’m worried this girl is now jeopardizing my own safety because she is unprepared. I decide I need to tell my teammate it’s not working out.

I break down and tell her. There is a dad that trailed us the first day and the three of us got along. He was planning on doing the trip in 10 days and was more her pace. I offer to either get her halfway so she can get off the trail or set her up so she can stay an extra day at camp and meet up with him. I offer to give her some of my meals which would leave me with nothing extra but I felt like it was some sort of olive branch. I don’t want her to have a horrible time and she really wants to finish so maybe finishing with this guy is a good compromise. She starts sobbing saying she didn’t realize she was holding me back and then agrees to text the other backpacker.

We get to camp and meet the hikers we saw in the morning. She talks to them and I can feel the glares in my direction. They decide to empower her and tell her that she can do it in the time constraint on the plan that they are doing, though they don’t offer for her to hike with them. They tell her we already did the most difficult part and the rest is easier (Tbf this is true).  She decides she staying on the trail “with the group” which translates into hiking with me and ending up at the same camp as everyone. I timed it, I am walking on average for 3 minutes before she screeches telling me to wait and takes another three minutes to catch up.

I decide to make the most of this and try to be friends with the hikers. They start making some side remarks and I can tell everyone has this narrative that I’m the girl who tried ditching her friend instead of telling her she could do it. She goes on to tell them all around the campfire that she is getting married when she gets back home. The hikers ask what she’s doing about her bachelorette party and she shrugs and says jokingly “I guess this is it”. Me and this girl are acquaintances but to this group of hikers I am now the girl her tried to ditch a bride to be during her bachelorette trip. The amount of shit side remarks from these backpackers after that made me pretty miserable and I felt like a couple of them went out of their way to get justice for my teammate. Little things like cheering for her and dead silence for me, there were so many of these instances to make me feel like the odd one out. I could have taken them aside to explain but I just came to the conclusion that these people had already judged me so they weren’t really the kind of people I wanted as friends anyways. I can’t say it didn’t bother me at all but I tried my best to remind myself to keep my head high and get through it.

Day 3 I had to carry both of our packs for a section and other hikers had to help her climb over rocks. On last stretch of the trail I got the pleasure of hearing her for an hour repeat affirmations to herself aloud “I am a queen I am everything”. On the van ride back the other hikers were saying they knew this whole time she could do it and she would have gotten caught in rain if she waited for the hiker behind us. Perhaps I am butthurt from being an idiot but if felt like a jab at me really.   Turns out, she never has solo adventured she just makes her social media look like it. She finished the trail hobbling. On the way back we split a cab and she asked the driver to stop at Walmart so she could get something for shin splits. She took her time and returned with a bunch of dry clothes that she bought for herself. All my things were soaked through. She missed days of work after getting back and told me she would have to hobble to the alter.  

Please someone else tell me they too have made an idiot impulsive decision that was catastrophic",humility thead,,Spirited-Bit8817,,0,2023-02-02 00:09:36

But we have some reservations on the summer time heat in Portugal and was hoping people on here might have some insight on stroller friendly alternatives? We will also have our carrier backpack, so the trail doesn't have to be 100% stroller friendly, but we just know our baby girl wouldn't be happy all day in the carrier, so finding a trail the stroller can handle is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I backpack I am rarely able to sleep.

I'm autistic, and I always sleep with my hands and feet tightly wrapped in my blanket. When I'm in a sleeping bag, I can't wrap my hands and feet and I end up tossing and turning all night. I usually end up wrapping my hands in a jacket or shirt but it only sort of works. 

I've researched sleeping quilts, but they are designed to use less fabric and connect to the sleeping pad, which doesn't solve my problem

I live in Alaska. I need something as warm and light as possible. My thought was to put some type of ultralight blanket INSIDE a sleeping bag liner, so I can twist myself up in the blanket like my autistic ass needs, but still have the liner that gives me the enclosed protection.

Just looking for advice on where to visit in India over the course of March-May.

Ideally, I was going to start in South India (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Hampi) up to Rajasthan &amp; Punjab via Goa, Gokarna &amp; finally the northern Himalaya region (Himachal Pradesh, Rishikesh, Leh).
But I’ve read conflicting reports on the weather in Rajasthan in April, some things I’ve read say it sits at about 32c &amp; some say it gets up to 48c. I think I’d rather spend more time somewhere cooler &amp; go back at a different time of year if it is true it gets up to 40c+.

Another thing is I’d very much like to be in a good spot for Holi &amp; I understand that it’s primarily a Northern Indian celebration.

Would it be feasible to do Rajasthan etc. in March then South India around April then travel back up to Amritsar region?

I’ll also be going to Varanasi at some point, not sure when though.

So far I haven’t been finding a lot of information other than there is really no backpacking in Sedona, which is why I’m asking for routes near Sedona. No travel booked yet so completely open to other locations as well. We’re looking for something moderate, not super touristy, and really looking to see the variety of landscapes known to AZ.

backpacking,"Hello travelers. 

First of all, I'm posting on mobile and English isn't my first language. So I apologize in advance for any spelling/formatting errors.

This Sunday, I (25m) will begin a 3-4 months solo traveling trip through South America. I'm starting in Brazil (Florianapolis), and will be going to Rio at the end of February. 

I haven't done much solo traveling other than a week this summer, and are new to the experience. Is there anything that vastly differs when traveling solo compared to traveling with others, and something I should be aware of? 

I don't have much planned other than the first couple of weeks and are therefore eager to hear any recommendations you guys might have. 

I'm looking to explore the region and it's culture, but am also hoping to meet like-minded travelers and make friends along the way. 

ANY tips and tricks you guys have are more than welcome, and if this post doesn't provide enough information for you to do so, please let me know. 

I will gladly elaborate in the comment section.

I often have feet problems when I hike in normal hiking boots. With a wider toe box I don't have such problems. Currently I'm hiking with Merrell Vapor Glove Luna barefoot shoes. But on longer hikes with spiky stones I wish to have a bit more of a sole. 
I heard a lot about the Altra. But what I don't like is that they wear out so quickly. The price is reasonable, but not if you have to buy every season another pair. 
Joe Nimble is more or less the same. Bought a pair, the sole was nearly gone after a few months. I got a new pair by service and the same thing started. Nearly 200€ for a pair of shoes which only last for a few months at best is just to high.

backpacking,"Several years ago, when I lived in Colorado, a group of friends were over and we were playing some tunes. It was late, but someone thought it would be a good idea to get up early the next morning and summit Uncompaghre, Colorado's sixth highest peak, nestled within Colorado's Uncompaghre Wilderness. I was still relatively new to Colorado, and had always wanted to climb one of the coveted ""14ers"", so I immediately committed myself.   


The next morning, everyone that was at my place the night before were now standing in my dark parking lot. My musician buddies thought it would be neat to bring their instruments to the top. The route is an 8 mile loop that climbs around 3000 feet, so they just gave me a sad smile. You see, I'm a musician - an upright bassist- and everyone knew I wasn't carrying a bulky, 50 lb or more instrument to the top of a mountain!   


I  told them I was game and so was ""Space Bass"".  It was a joke. We all laughed when I threw it into the back of the pickup. We all laughed when I hauled it out of the truck onto the trail, and we all laughed about halfway through the trip when the steep peak came into view.I planned to ditch the bass somewhere on the trail and pick it up on the way down, but I thought,""Hell, why not give it a shot?""

 Well, we gave it a shot and we made it. There was a little sketch spot, but most of it was just one step at a time. When we got to the top, we played some tunes, had some cool pictures with our celebratory summit beer, and then began our hike back down the mountain. This spontaneous, one off, non-planned adventure was one of the most definitive moments of my adult life. This trip sparked a huge love-affair with the mountains. Over the next few years I backpacked and climbed mountains almost every weekend, even in the winter. I just ran across some of the photos and thought I would share!","Basspacking to the summit of Uncompaghre's 14,321 foot summit",,Skillet007,,0,2023-01-29 20:21:01

backpacking,"30M in California here and my work is thankfully putting us back to remote work this May/June after being in office the past year. We were originally remote and for 6 months last year (September-March) I traveled across the country staying in airbnb rooms week to week. I literally stayed in a 25 airbnbs total, 1 a week at a time from Montana to South Carolina just exploring and doing some overnight camping on the weekends and driving my way across the country a little bit at a time. I work 7am-4pm PST and my goal was to keep my routine the same as back home as I feel great when I have that. I worked from my airbnb room desk during the day, meal prepped with an airfryer, ate out some for lunch at amazing bbq places, went to gym after work, and hiked or tent camped on the weekends. I stayed in a lot of cities but was able to stay in some unbelievable remote mountain airbnbs which I loved because it was so relaxing and most of them were still 30-45 minutes from a city so I could still keep my routine of working, cooking, gym, etc.

But that got extremely tiring and expensive so this time id love to do it different. I was paying on average $45-$65 a night on airbnbs and with small weekly discounts I was paying about $1500-1700 a month. Those were just for single rooms and not to mention the effort of trying to plan where I would stay next. I make $70K a year so trying to keep it under $1000 a month if possible. I dont care about staying in big cities as thats not what interests me.

I love backpacking, hiking, camping, waking up to beautiful places, so i'd love to spend this summer in Colorado, Washington, Montana, Utah, Wyoming or so. I figure I have a couple options

1. Get a room/place as a ""home base"" 1 month at a time. Use craigslist, facebook marketplace, [booking.com](https://booking.com/), or even airbnb monthly discounts to find a place under $1000 and essentially do what I did last time, but instead of changing places week to week I would only have to do it month to month
2. Screw it and try to camp it for the summer. I am wondering if this is doable as there are a few obstacles. First is obviously internet. I do 1-2 zoom meetings per day and need internet throughout the work day. I have a hotspot on my phone so I figure if I can find some dispersed camping where there is full Verizon coverage, I should be good? Next is just the logistics of working from my car/campsite. I have and can sleep in my car, I have a foldable mattress so that not a problem. But I don't have a problem setting up my tent as well. I figure I would just put up my camping chair (maybe get a small foldable table) and work from outside. And I can always get a hotel or airbnb room for a night if I get tired of it.
3. Coworking space during day or Cafe in mountain town. Then going to camp nearby after work and back the next morning.

Regarding camping, one idea I had was camping in free public lands (using the ioverlander app) or cheap campgrounds and being near a city so I have a better chance at having internet. I even have this idea of camping but still having a solid routine but Im not sure if is possible. So lets say I find a campsite with coverage in a dispersed camping area a few miles outside of Breckenridge. I make that my ""place"" for a week and sleep and do some work there. But I still have the ability to go to town after work to hit the gym (where I can shower), go to the grocery store to pick up some food, even go out to eat, and then head back to camp. And maybe even being able to work from a cafe or coworking space (not sure if these are solid?)

For example I heard of seasonal workers in Crested Butte, Colorado who were almost forced to do this. They were priced out of their apartments so they had to camp near town and then go to work in the morning.

Any areas or epic hikes or cities you 100% recommend? I was in Kalispell Montana last winter and loved it and am definitely planning on spending a month near there so I can go to Glacier a few weekends",Where to work out West this Summer for Epic hikes,,jennyloves123,,0,2023-01-28 19:15:51

backpacking,"I no longer have to carry gear for my kids when we go backpacking so I'm thinking it's time to get a smaller backpack. I'm also interested in decreasing the base weight of what I pack. On one hand I don't think every pound matters but I also think that if my pack was 5 pounds lighter, my body would thank me for it. Some basic numbers for my existing base weight:
Osprey Athaer 85 backpack, 2.27kg (5 lbs) 
MEC down sleeping bag - 9C (14 F), 1.45 kg (3.2lbs)
Big Agnes Copper Spur 2P tent, 1.8 kg (4lbs)
Thermarest neoair pad
Gigapower manual stove
Gsr soloist cookset
All of the above in the pack has a weight of 6.2 kg (13.7 lbs). 

I think I've only ever been too warm with this sleeping bag once. I also usually carry headlamp, stripen uv water purifier, hydration bag, Arcteryx Atom insulated jacket (345 g), rain jacket, small camera, basic clothing and dehydrated food/nuts/oatmeal.

Im also seriously considering carrying a camp chair (Helios) and getting a lightweight pillow. I weigh about 66kg and usually hike in the PNW and rockies/Purcells in BC. 

I see the biggest opportunties in getting a lighter load is through the pack, bag and tent. 
Any suggestions on what I should upgrade to?

backpacking,"I am 18F and still at school but have applied for a deferred entry to university. 

My original plan was to solo travel as a female to loads of different countries from South America, Africa to SEA. Then I realized this wasn't possible because it would be way too intense for a first time solo traveler and as it is starting to come up to my gap year, I have more and more reserves about solo traveling as a female at this age as most people go with at least a friend. 

That is why not I have decided to apply for jobs as a GAP Student in the UK (where I live) and that was I can travel during school holidays or when my contract ends. I feel like this role would be really fun and hopefully allow me to meet like-minded gap students who would want to travel together.

However, I am now not sure if my traveling can fit into my year with that job. Some schools demand a full academic year whilst others demand a term. It would be ideal if I could find a Gap Student placement in South Africa or SEA but I can't seem to find any and am not sure if I am looking at the right places. My current plan is to backpack SEA (Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos (places ranked from most to least important)) between Jan - Feb/March but I am not sure if that is enough time to properly see each of these places. I am now coming up to my A levels (final exams) and the stress is starting to kick in because I have to start planning my gap year such as submitting job applications on top of schoolwork and it is just getting a bit too much. That is why I was thinking of joining a Group Tour, I was looking at the Ultimate Gap Year by Gap360 which seems alright, if anyone has had any experience with them please let me know, But I am just worried about not having enough freedom to do things I want to do and picking my own hostels, meeting new people at each place etc. 

TLDR:

I've got too many things I want to do during my gap year such as:

- Work as a GAP Student (UK (where I live), Australia, SEA, South Africa (ideal but can't find any positions))
- Backpack SEA
- Volunteer + Visit Africa next summer (teaching, wildlife, medical, can't decide)
- Learn to Surf in a Surf Camp (Bali/Spain/Portugal)

Would it be possible to do them all whilst working as a Gap Student at school during term time? 

How should I go about looking for Gap Student job vacancies in other countries?  I have looked at different country's association websites and unable to find any and Letz Live which looks great but they require me to pay now as applications are due and my mind isn't set yet.

If you were 18F and finding it hard to plan your gap year, would you sacrifice the extra freedom of solo traveling to go on a group tour? 

Should I go on a group tour if I am a first time solo female 18yo traveler? 

Solo Travel Pros:
- Freedom to do what I want
- Something I've wanted to do for a while 
- Able to control my living situation and people I am around because I can choose hostels and meet different people

Solo Travel Cons:
- I am getting really stressed about planning it 
- What if I hate it, can't make friends and feel really lonely? 
- What if it is too much for me because of my inexperience?

Group Travel Pros:
- No need to plan as much 
- Guaranteed to meet people
- Could be really fun and less stressful as everything is already sorted 

Group Travel Cons:
- Less freedom
- I can't pick and choose my own hostels (I want to stay at party hostels and meet people) 
- There are too many options out there!!

Another option for something I can do is go on a group tour to volunteer in one country or visit a couple and then from there, I gain some experience of solo traveling and can see if I am up for actually doing it on my own or even meeting someone on the tour to do with

Are there any group tours company you would recommend? I am currently looking at PMGY, Gap360 and Gadventures for traveling and the Mighty Roar for volunteer experiences. 

Sorry about the blurb if you can't tell I'm really stressing and am prone to overthinking up until the point where i'm just like ""sod it"" and do whatever but I just don't want to waste this year as a Gap Year is something I've wanted to for a long time especially backpacking but I am also worried about it being not as great as people make it out to be and also whether I would make friends or have a good experience as a Chinese british female traveler.

I love meeting and talking to new people, partying and just doing spontaneous things, I don't like being tied down but at the same time I need a sense of security of having at least someone there with me.

I hope this letter finds you well, because I sure as heck am not. Can we talk about something that's been bugging me lately? (No pun intended, because if you're one of the culprits, then you know bugs are the least of my concerns.)

First of all, can we discuss the whole headphone thing? I get it, you want to jam out to your music, but can you please do it through your headphones? I don't want to hear your terrible taste in music (or podcasts, or audiobooks, or whatever else you're listening to) blaring through the walls at all hours of the night. I mean, I know I'm not the only one who's trying to sleep here.

And speaking of sleep, can we please keep the noise level to a minimum after hours? I know it's hard to contain your excitement about being on vacation, but some of us have to wake up early for, you know, actual vacation activities. And while we're on the subject, can we please stop turning on the main light in the middle of the night? It's like a beacon calling out to the hungover, sleepy ghosts of hostels past.

And let's talk about cleanliness, shall we? I'm all for having a good time, but when you're puking inside the room and leaving it there for the rest of us to deal with, that's just not cool. And finally, let's talk about snoring. I don't know what you guys are eating, but whatever it is, please stop it. Some of us are trying to sleep here, and your chainsaw impersonations are not helping.

All in all, I'm just asking for a little bit of consideration for your fellow hostel dwellers. We're all in this together, and let's make sure we're all getting the most out of our vacation.

I will be hiking the Lycian way next month and was wondering about any good snorkeling beaches or coves along or near the trail.

I know it’ll still be chilly in February but I am very used to swimming in cold water and I absolutely love snorkeling when I get the chance. If the day is warm enough it would be worth knowing the spots to take a quick snorkel dip.

Silk-sunset, certain shades of white, tar on the roads, gloom beyond the oil lamp afloat on the lake, ripples in the water, fog on the mirror, spring garden, fairy palace, subject of the poems, emptiness in the eyes, absence of words, forever in ordinary things, and the old roses on a breeze, where love arrives in memories of forever to liberate us into life.

backpacking,"I literally just got back from REI, and I tried on every backpack in the store, and literally the only one that fit me was the Talon 44 L/XL. I am 6'1"" 172 pounds. I nearly pulled the trigger and just bought it, but I decided to wait until I got home to do some research.

I intend to use this backpack as my gym bag, and just an every day type of bag to get stuff around.  Up until this point getting my shit back and forth to the gym has been so painful. I cannot have my regular backpack on my back at all, so what I always do is hold it in my right hand only (left doesn't work for some reason), and I have to set it down every half block. 

My brother let me try on his backpacking backpack, and I was in awe at the fact that even though it was quite packed I couldn't feel it in my back because most of the weight was on my hips. 

So I realized I need a backpacking type backpack with hip straps for every day use, it is my only option due to my condition. I would love to use it for hiking as well, but up until this point in my life I have always assumed I could never hike with a bag because my back was too bad. But we'll see. 

Anyway, I really liked the 44 and it honestly seemed about the size of my current gym bag and I think it would fit everything and maybe even be a tight fit because my shower towel is quite thick and takes up a lot of space lol. And I bring a change of clothes and my swimsuit and my shower stuff and protein shaker and goggles. But ya I guess I only thought it might be tight because the 44 is very narrow, like it is skinny and long, which I like, it fit so well.

However, once I got home I realized there is a Talon 22, which actually looks like a regular backpack. I was considering that, but unfortunately REI didn't have one to try on so I am left wondering if they fit the exact same as each other or not.

I am not sure if I would be willing to spend $160 on a small backpack. I rather like the fact that the 44 can be used for so many different things, it feels like I could use it around the city and for hiking, and the gym. I feel like the 22 is only for the city. 

And I'm also not sure if the 22 would fit my stuff because I can't see it in person because the REI didn't have it. 

Also, would you guys buy your backpack at REI or would you buy it at amazon or something? The REI return policy and lifetime warranty did seem appealing. But you tell me, I'm new to this world, what do you guys do? 

I guess I'm just afraid people will look at me like I'm a weirdo for carrying the Talon 44 around the city since it looks like an actual backpacking backpack. I feel like I'd blend in with the 22 more, but honestly I really do like the 44 and feel like it is a great size. 

But ya I really don't know, I would like to take whichever bag I choose on a plane possibly, would they allow the 22 but not the 44? 

But ya the main question I have is whether or not the 22 and the 44 fit the exact same. 

I'd love your advice, thanks! And if you have any other advice for someone trying to reduce backpain, I'd love to hear it! thanks pals &lt;3","I have scoliosis and neck issues and I want to start using a backpacking bag for my every day bag, and to go to the gym.

backpacking,"Hey everyone! Just looking for a little advice for an upcoming trip. I'm going to be backpacking through Asia for around 4-9 months. I've got my first 3-4 months roughly planned out due to visa restrictions in countries and freediving training I'll be doing which will take me from Indonesia to Phillipines to Borneo and down to Komodo. From there I'll be heading up through Malaysia and beyond. 

Now I haven't been backpacking for aaaages. My last trip was 6 months in Central America and I had a regular sized backpack(about 30L) and a huge 85L travel backpack full. Thing is I ended up just carting around most of the clothing without ever touching it. I wasn't efficient with anything and just lumped it in. I found having the massive bag a huge inconvenience too. It wasn't so bad because I wasn't flying around so no having to check the luggage everytime etc. But in Asia I will be taking a lot of flights. 

I have a mirrorless camera with 3 lenses(only one zoom and the other two are tiny and light), a laptop, GoPro and then from there it's just clothes and essentials that I'll need. 

My question is, am I nuts in thinking a 45L could possibly be enough to hold all my stuff that I need? I think the bulk of my big bag last time was just unnecessary clothes. I ended up just buying singlets etc. And re-wearing the same thing over and over again anyways. Anyone have experience travelling on a big trip light like this? I'm out of practice so are there any logistics I'm not considering?? I mean if this bag gets stolen I'm pretty cooked, but that'll be the case regardless as my smaller bag likely would contain my valuables anyways. 

I'm looking at the Wandrd Prvke 41L or the Peak Design 45L travel backpack. Unfortunately not able to find in stores near me I don't think so I can't see in person but can buy/return.

backpacking," Hi,  
I am going to Europe for a couple weeks (last week of May and beginning of June). I am looking for a 3 to 5 ish day trek to do. I am mostly interested in mountainous trails (bonus points if wild camping is allowed but not necessary), but the problem is I’m having trouble finding somewhere where the weather would be good in late May/early June.   
I would love to do the Dolomites for example, but it seems there will be too much snow at that time of year. I then was attracted to the Albanian Alps but I’ve seen some people say the same about that area as well (too much snow, too rainy).   
Are there any good mountain treks to do in late May/early June?  
Thanks in advance :)",Are there any good mountain treks to do in late May/early June in Europe?,,Ok-Wafer-3491,,0,2023-01-24 16:45:16
backpacking,"Hi folks! I come from Hong Kong. I'll be spending 20 days in West Coast Canada in Late March-Mid April. I've planned an itinerary and would love to have some advice regarding its doability or whether it's sensible.

I've already bought the flight ticket, arrive and depart at Vancouver.

My interests are natural splendor, historical significance, food and drinks, and architecture.

I can't drive, so I'll be taking public transport everywhere.

My planned budget is no more than $3800CAD for the whole trip (excludes arrive/depart flight which I've already paid for). As I'm on a budget, I'll stay at hostels.

I am used to the ""sight-seeing mode"" of traveling but I am eager to experience something other than watching; that said, I am not sporty at all.

Going to Bali in May for about 2 weeks. It’s my first time backpacking and so I was wondering what you guys thought would be the best option for me. Personally, I really like the detachable daypack on the 55, especially because I think it’s possible to take it as my personal item on the flight. 
On the other hand I see a lot of people recommending the 40 over the 55, but I never see a reason to it. The main backpack on the 55 is 40L too isn’t it?

Would love to hear your thoughts.

I’m from europe l, so my flight will be about 18-20 hours long, which is why I want a small bag for the plane where I can store my documents, headphones, a book or two, some money and some snacks and drinks. In Bali I’ll be staying in Hostels and travel to a new city every 2-4 days or so.

backpacking,"So I got a bivy bag. I've always used tents before, never tried a tarp or hammock, but decided to branch out since I'm interested in trying some winter hiking and was hoping the bivy could give a boost to my 30 degree bag. I'm a big believer in trying out new any equipment close to home, so I went out to do a bit of stealth camping for the night in a nearby bit of woods. 

Conditions were terrible, 30-33 degrees F, and raining with maybe 6 inches of snow cover. Pretty miserable, but not out of the ordinary for my area. I knew it was going to be a pretty rough test sleeping out in the bivy with no tarp overhead, and I'd read about condensation and all the cons that come along with bivy sacks. 

Getting in and getting set up was really quick and easy, and I even managed to stay fairly dry and keep my sleeping bag dry. But with heavier precipitation, or more wind I could see how that might not be possible depending on conditions.

The first few hours I was pretty toasty and comfortable. Before I fell asleep I did a pretty good job minimizing condensation buildup by keeping a small opening in the zipper and breathing directly through that. Once I fell asleep though, I wasn't able to keep that up. By 5:30am the condensation buildup was pretty bad, and my down bag had lost a lot of loft, especially around my shoulders. Luckily I was still dry inside, but it was getting chilly.

That's when I called it quits and went home. If I'd been out somewhere where I wasn't able to bail I'd have had to get up, pack all my wet gear, and just hang out till the sun came up trying not to freeze, and if I'd had a second night out planned, I'd have to scratch that as I'd have no good way of drying my sleeping gear out.

Lessons learned:

\- Bivys are appealing for the weight and minimal packed space, but using one takes practice (to be fair, using a tent in adverse conditions takes some practice, too).

\- Bivys really do benefit from a tarp, which would have allowed me to keep the top of the bivy open and avoided all the condensation buildup from my breath.

\- If conditions really suck, and you have no tarp, you'll need to close the bivy up pretty much all the way, and you might not be able to stay out for multiple nights due to all the moisture you're trapping.

Apologies if formatting is wrong, I’m on mobile and don’t often post. 

I’m currently in Western Australia, not sure if this is the best place to post this question but if anyone has any other subreddit suggestions please let me know!

So basically, I’ve already completed my three month regional work in south west Australia with one employer, and I applied for (and was granted) my 2nd working holiday visa to stay another year. My question is: if I decided to do some more farm work while travelling within my first year, before my second year visa starts, would that potentially damage my visa grant?

The requirements for the regional work is either 3 months (if you stay with the same employer) or 88 individual days if you work for multiple employers, which ends up being over 4 months in total.

backpacking,"\#郭文貴 #GuoWenGui  It is understandable to say that the two parties in the United States are fighting fiercely. The new Speaker of the US House of Representatives, McCarthy, announced his visit to Taiwan as soon as he took office, and set up an anti-Chinese establishment to gain more support. What is the purpose of Guo Wengui's hard work? Hearing that McCarthy was going to visit Taiwan, Guo Wengui became excited, and he spoke clearly and logically in the live broadcast, as if he had both the United States and China under his control. His expression and posture really made people laugh. To say that he is an excellent comedian, I would have no doubts.

Then again, Guo Wengui's desire to perform has long been uncontrollable. Since 2018, he has produced a program ""Guo Wengui Watching the Spring Festival Gala"", and he will perform impromptu performances every year. Just a casual look, the content of the ""revealing news"" in the program is very similar to the lines and scripts, he reads the script from time to time, if he forgets what to say in the next sentence, he starts to make up random words, one after another obscene words, underage Not suitable for everyone to watch. He worked very hard, and held it every year for 4 years. The cold rice from 4 years ago was fried again and again, and it became a ""new revelation"" after adding oil and vinegar.

Last month, he announced that his father passed away and retreated for three weeks. He did it, but few people knew what he was doing during these three weeks. In the first episode after his ""comeback"", he talked eloquently, with a happy face, and his beard could not stop his ""excitement"". Could it be that he has been preparing for the 2023 ""Spring Festival Gala"" performance for the past three weeks?

As we all know, Guo Wengui is an internationally wanted criminal. He could have found a hidden place to hide, but chose to expose himself on social platforms. From this aspect, it shows that his background is quite ""hard"". You know, the United States likes people like Guo Wengui. People, even if the person is full of lies and nonsense, they still welcome it. But Guo Wengui is smarter than ""these people"". He firmly seized the opportunity to curry favor with the upper echelons of the United States, and acted as a dog licker at critical moments so that he could gain a firm foothold in the United States. Bannon, Trump's former adviser, was undoubtedly picked up by him. Now Guo Wengui is playing McCarthy's idea again, talking about McCarthy, but are Americans so stupid? So naive, just taking advantage of each other.

backpacking,"I live in Colorado and I enjoy winter camping. I would like to try some winter backpacking, but only have a 0 degree down bag, which is pretty warm down to low 20s as I am a warm sleeper. 

The problem is I don’t have too much money to buy a negative degree bag especially since I spent $300 on my 0 degree bag, but I occasionally use a thin sleeping bag liner with my current bag which adds a bit of warmth. 

I use the Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme sleeping bag liner and I know it says it adds 25F I know that is not true. 

But my main question would be, if I bought the fleece liner by Sea to Summit which says adds 32F (again I know it’s not that much) and combined it with my current Extreme liner, would you think that would add enough warmth to get into single digits? That would only add an extra 1lbs and some change if I purchased the fleece liner and it’s only $99, as opposed to if I just purchased a $600 negative temp sleeping bag. 

Also, I know what some people may say, I know to pair it with a good R Value pad!

TLDR: Would combining a zero degree down bag with Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme and Sea to Summit Fleece liner be warm enough to actually get down to single digits?

backpacking,"TL,DR: I'm 27M, taking a career break and looking to backpack for 4-5 months from mid-Feb and I'm trying to decide between SE Asia and South America.  Any tips / advice / random thoughts welcome!?  Especially relating to the current situation in the region's and whether it's the right time to go, e.g. Peru.

--

Bit of background: I'm 27 and worked in finance since I left uni.  I wasn't able to afford to take a gap year / long term travel when I was younger (did a couple of months here / there and spent time with family living abroad) but I recently quit my job and I want to take advantage of the career break to do some solo backpacking.  

I'm not minted but not on a shoestring so have reasonable budget flexibility, am active, confident traveller (have always travelled - Cambodia / Borneo) and looking for a mixture of culture / nature / hiking / some partying.  I'm going to leave mid-Feb (save paying rent!!) but can't decide whether to go to South America or India+South East Asia...??  I always wanted to travel to both regions (I'll do both eventually) so I've got detailed plans for both that work with the relevant seasons.

In terms of thoughts...

SE Asia:
 - Pros: Amazing places to travel; great food; more land travel options (prefer to travel through rather than fly where possible - love a long train); likely easier to social given the number of backpackers
 - Cons: I've visited a few places previously (Bangkok/Chiang Mai, Siem Reap, Borneo); I'm worried the crowd will a lot younger and focussed more on partying and budget travel
 - Political situation: Myanmar and Sri Lanka probably the only whole countries to avoid

South America:
 - Pros: More amazing nature / scenery - generally appeals more; a completely new culture that I've never visited before
 - Cons: Less of a backpacker culture, so might be harder to socialise; food is less reliable across the continent although fantastic in certain places
- Political situation: Bit worried that I might be effected by the current turmoil - Peru is a big part of my trip and it looks impossible at the moment, as well as Brazil and quite a few other areas

backpacking,"Hello
I am F28 and I’ve been depressed for some time. It hasn’t been easy and I feel this fucking disease took precious years in this planet away from me.
As a plus, my parents weren’t the best teaching me how to be brave or even sociable. They are closed persons, without friends and afraid of life. I tried to escape that, but I didn’t succeeded 100%.

I wanna do something. I need to do something. I am slowly rotting.
Could you give me suggestions? Please?

What are fun and crazy festivals, parties, parades or orgies around the world? lol I’ve heard of La Tomatina and Holi.

What’s something thrilling and exciting?

Where is an amazing place to learn cool stuff, like sailing or fixing cars, chopping wood, milking cows, surfing etc? I feel the need to use my body. I wanna learn stuff. I’ve heard of a project called earthship global, where you build sustainable houses. I need to research it more, but it sounds interesting (as long as it isn’t an white savior situation).

Any tips of trails?
Of course, I know the PCT. That’s a hard one, right? :( I wanted something long and beautiful. The idea of walking and being alone seems strangely exciting.
But, the thing is, I’ve never camped before. I am not in great shape. I would get my ass kicked even in a tiny and easy trail. 
My dread is to climb the Kilimanjaro. I’ve watched too much The lion king when I was a kid lol They say it isn’t a technical climb, but I am pretty sure I would fail, tho… Like I said, I’m not in a great shape.

Please?
Suggestions?

Anything that seems like loads of fun, quirky, weird places, gardens with erotics sculptures, water (i wanna take my PADI certification so badly so I can scuba dive alone!), somewhere I can learn stuff, real adventure, abandoned constructions…

And that’s it.

backpacking,"I am thinking about backpacking somewhere in East Africa for three weeks in late April/early May and have been looking at Uganda and Rwanda. I've been to Ghana, Sierra Leone and Namibia and found it easy and enjoyable to get around Ghana with a backpack, but I used to live there back then, which obviously made it quite easy as I was quite familiar with the place.

As a uni student I am looking to travel on a budget using mostly public transport (matatus) and hostels/cheaper guest houses, and I was wondering how easy that would be in Uganda and Rwanda?

Also, what things would you suggest I check out? I am not looking for mountain gorillas or going on safari (did plenty of that in Namibia), and would like to focus more on cultural aspects, exploring local areas on foot, and more accessible nature that doesn't require shelling out on pricey guides.

My rough thinking so far is to take a route that starts in Kampala, then heads east to the Twenzori Mountains (checking out Entebbe and Sipi Falls on the way), then turning south towards Rwanda, passing the Lake Katwe salt pans, and continuing to Kigali, then Lake Kivu.

The one thing I thought about splurging on may be hopping over into the DRC and climbing Nyirangongo, because the lava lake has been on my bucket list for the better part of a decade by now.

I really wanted to do those cities because Munich is more stereotypical German cute city (while Berlin, which I'm still super interested in, is not) and Salzburg is just so beautiful looking. I'd also like to visit Eagles Nest while I'm in that area. But I realize it's a pretty big detour from the rest of the itinerary for only a very short visit.

I’d like a new backpack that can serve me for two-three weeks backpacking (I’ll be spending three weeks in India next month) but also hold up for a couple of nights hiking with relatively light and compact gear ( I have a two night trip in Tasmania planned later this year). 

I think I’ve narrowed it down to the Osprey Farpoint Trek 55 or the Osprey Exos 48 but would welcome thoughts and advice.

backpacking,"**I would love thoughts on my heavier gear choices.**

I am a big guy, 275 lbs. and 6' tall, and I will be backpacking with my two boys. I am in remission from a very bad fight with oral cancer that has left me with some physical needs I did not have before. This is compounded by osteoarthritis in one knee. Despite all of this, I have no physical activity restrictions, I hit the gym 3-5 days each week for weight lifting and cardio, and my doctors see no reason I cannot backpack. **My needs include:**

* I must use a water bladder when hiking, not a water bottle. I need to take tiny sips every few minutes because I make very little saliva. I cannot afford to run out of water on the trail, even for an hour.
* My body is healing and will be for years, so I need more comfort than most backpackers. A good night's sleep and an elevated place to sit are necessities, not luxuries if I am hiking.
* I cannot guarantee that I can throw the line for a bear bag.

My boys are 7 and 10. They already enjoy car camping and hiking with me. We will start with an overnight trip or two this spring and then move to weekends or longer during the summer. I will have to carry all of our group gear including food because their personal items will likely max out their carrying capacity. Although they can do a 5-mile loop hike with a 1000' elevation gain, we will start with smaller backpacking trips until we know they (and my bad knee) can handle more with the extra weight.

**Here is my current plan for big items for me and the group gear:**

* Tent - Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL4 - 5 lb. 4 oz.
* Tent Footprint - Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL4 Footprint - 11 oz.
* Sleeping Pad - Big Agnes Q-Core Deluxe long, wide (25""x78"") - 2lb. 2 oz.
* Quilt - Enlightened Equipment Revelation Custom, regular length, extra-wide 10d nylon, 850 fill, 20 F rated - 1 lb. 11 oz.
* Backpack - Osprey Aether 65 - 5 lbs.
* Cooking System - Jetboil Sumo - 1 lb.
* Bear Canister - I have no idea
* Backpacking stool - I have no idea

There is a big weight jump between the Copper Spur UL3 and UL4 that I am not thrilled with, but a 3-person tent seems like a bad idea for a big dad and two growing boys. The boys are autistic, though you likely would not know it when meeting them, and thus they have sensory and emotional regulation needs. They are not yet ready to camp in hammocks or in a tight space.

I know that footprints are not strictly needed, but I anticipate having some distractions when we set up camp. I would rather we protect our expensive tent from my mistakes.

I could save weight on the sleeping pad by going with the Q-core SLX. I am not sure if the weight savings is worth the decreased R-value, though. A Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Xlite wide would save 1 lb. 3 oz., but I am a big guy and a side sleeper. From what I have read that pad might not give me as comfortable a night's rest.

I already ordered the custom Revelation quilt on Black Friday, so that is a done deal.

The Osprey Aether was strongly recommended to me based on how much gear I will need to carry for the family. I found it to be a very comfortable pack when I tried it on with weight.

I am looking at the Jetboil Sumo because it can cook for the three of us at once. I need a stove that can potentially do more than just boil water because my boys' sensory needs may limit what they can eat on the trail.

I do not know what would be a good choice for a bear canister and a backpacking chair. I could see using an Ursack over a canister. I could also see using a canister to double as my chair so long as I wait until just before bed to put it away from camp. We live and hike in black bear country.

My base weight is already at \~16 lbs. before I add in the bear canister, stool, and personal items. Then food for 3 and a generous water portion will increase it further.

If I cannot use an oral device to deal with my sleep apnea, I may need another 5 lbs. of equipment for a travel CPAP.

**I would love any feedback you wish to give. I am happy to answer any questions you have. Heck, and thoughts or suggestions at all are welcome!

So! My passport has finally been approved and the last time I left the U.S. was half my life ago. Long story short is that my health isn't going to last me forever at this rate so I wanna get out there. Short story long is that about six years ago my mom had a tragically short bout with an aggressive unknown cancer, literally months before being the first in her family to ever retire, and had been holding off until then to start actually living her life. Put my own life on hold to process (I'd just gotten engaged months before this lol life, right?). Fast forward a bit and now four years ago, just as I was really getting back to seeing forward in life, had a job that paid well, no kids or responsibilities, etc. I decided this was it - time to get out and see the world!

That was fall 2019. Lol. So we paused again.

Now... two years ago, I was unexpectedly diagnosed with late onset T1 diabetes (blessing and a curse tbh because I've never felt healthier than I do now but it adds a whole slew of layers to travel plans). The biggest thing is that it made me *super* aware of my body's more limited shelf life, though. Gave myself time to get in habits and adjust to my new existence and then started looking forward again. Finally, earlier this year, I fainted alone in my home and while I managed to miss killing myself or suffering serious long term consequences by literally millimeters, it left me full of a deep seated WE GOTTA MAKE THE BEST OF THE TIME WE'VE GOT, KIDDO sentiment that has me itching to GO GO GO. The fainting was not from diabetes, btw- it was from standing up too quick lol doctor has given full OK for physical activity. 

So anyway... Help me make the right choice on where to start lol? I'm slowly building out my gear so at this point, not looking for anything too intense.

backpacking,"Hi,

I've never traveled in my life and it's a huge regret. I want to do it so badly.

But  at this point I'm 34 and I feel like everyone at hostels is 21 or  similar. The idea of staying at a hostel and being the old guy makes me  feel so sad and depressed. I miss being 20 with the attitude that the  world is my oister. Now I just feel like a boring adult and I feel like  20 year olds will want nothing to do with me.

I  feel like I would be completely out of place. I traveled once and  stayed at several hostels, at 29. And everyone was pretty much early 20s  and I already felt really old. Now at 34 it would be much worse.

I  used to be extremely shy at 20 and only now feel confident to do the  things everyone else did at 20. But now I'm going to be the old guy.....

Does  anyone have experience with that? How can you connect, and enjoy  meeting other people without feeling ancient? I happen to also look very  young so people who newly meet me usually think I'm mid to late 20s. I  feel like a fraud not telling them I'm much older.","Solo backpacking at 34, can you still connect?",,helpfulUp123,,0,2023-01-17 23:34:39

I'm hoping some of you familiar with backpacking in PA could help me find some low difficulty, 2-3 day backpacking routes, ideally within 3-ish hours of Philly (i.e., NEPA, Central PA, NJ, NY, etc.).

I do a lot of car camping and have done a few backpacking trips both solo and with friends, but my girlfriend is interested in joining me on a trip, probably this spring.

I know that's a long way away at this point, but I always like to plan ahead. My girlfriend is capable and loves being outside, but I figured something relatively easy (6-10 miles a day, 2-3 days) would be a good way to do our first trip together. I'm familiar with some routes in Loyalsock, Michaux, and Moshannon state forests in PA, but I'm wondering what the wide world of Reddit would recommend?

Any routes, tips, and etc. would be greatly appreciated!

The tricky section is breaking through into Asia. Europa should be straightforward, as should SE Asia. We have some thoughts on getting from Indonesia to Australia but it may not become clear until closer to the time!

Regarding reaching Asia - Although it would be ideal for getting to China, clearly the Trans-Siberian express is not currently a viable option (who knows what the future holds). Likewise, Iran is not possible at the moment. Our current options are:

1. Navigating the Stans after crossing the Caspian Sea from Baku
2. Find a cruise/tour through the Red Sea, ultimately ending in Mumbai
3. Can anyone think of other possible routes?

I am constantly out and about with a tent and also prefer to spend most or all of my nights in a tent. I would describe my way of moving as alpine trekking. I see only a few or none who move around in the Alpine region in a similar way to me. I also aim to spend as little money as possible-about 10 euros/day. I try to keep my ecological footprint close to zero and of course I try to use my feet 98% .I deliver pictures that very rarely anyone will see and extraordinary innovative stories that contain a high entertainment factor. I also believe that I am an innovative and creative person who always tries to break new ground, even if I definitely have ""staying power"". My tours cover the entire Alps. Currently I prefer the north of Italy for my tours. In the future, however, Switzerland, Slovenia and France will also be on the agenda.

Here my last projects:

Munich-Venice (approx. 500km):
on the legendary ""Traumpfad"". However, the passion quickly arose in me to create my own tours around official hiking trails. In general, it is important to me to migrate my own compositions and to have as much contact as possible to have with the mountains. I don't go the fastest route, but mostly the most demanding EE-Sentieros, and via ferrata if the situation allows. On this tour, for example, I climbed the Civetta, did the delle trincee via ferrata and made a complete Schiara crossing including all via ferratas .These are all the highlights that are not included in the official dream path.
Garda Trekk (approx. 150 km):
around the mountains of Lake Garda including a complete Monte Baldo crossing. Unfortunately, I injured myself on the tour so that my planned 14-day tour in Madeira could not take place.
Project: Back to the Roots (approx. 600 km)
Is a big project that should follow my Slovenian roots. The project is divided into several parts. I was able to do the first part in the summer, spending 40 days in the mountains with my tent. A personal and strong record that I'm proud of. It was an incredible adventure with many ups and some downs. I took the whole Brenta with me Crossed the national park including the mountains.
Como Trek (about 200 km)
About 6 weeks ago I came back from my last adventure, where I was able to discover part of the breathtaking mountains on Lake Como for myself. I crossed the whole Grigne Group and crossed the Dorsale del Triangolo Lariano high trail.

A very big project and linked to it are a lot of activities from my everyday life and also all future tours, the ascent of an 8000m peak or trekking tours in the Himalayas or Karakoram are also on the plan.

We plan on travelling through vietnam from north to south using trains, bikes or whatever means necessary. We will be sleeping in hostels or hotels so I don’t need any camping gear or anything. I would like to get one big backpack I can leave in the hotel and a smaller daypack for when I’m out and about.

backpacking,"As I was studying in Denmark, I fell in love with the country and its culture. One day, over a beer with my friend Adam, we were discussing the best way to truly get to know Denmark. I have to admit, I was sceptical about what Denmark had to offer, as I came from a country with rich forests and mountains, and Denmark is known for being flat.

We decided that the best way to truly experience the country would be to cycle it, and what better time to do it than in the summer? Denmark is known for being bike-friendly, and we had both been using bikes to get around since we arrived. We thought that cycling would allow us to take in the scenery at a leisurely pace and discover hidden gems that might be missed by other means of transportation. So, we set out to bike over 570 km in 10 days, exploring the country from south to north, similar to backpacking but on bicycles.

We decided to use public shelters as our accommodation, as there are many of them throughout the country. We asked our Danish friend for recommendations on the most interesting places to visit, and made a map of our route. We narrowed down our choices and planned a trajectory that would take us from Flensburg on the west coast of Denmark, all the way to the northernmost point, Skagen. We recorded the entire experience to document it and make it available to others who are interested in exploring Denmark Thanks for supporting our little project!

**TLDR:** *Two friends, while studying in Denmark, decided to explore the country by cycling from south to north over a period of 10 days. They biked over 570km and used public shelters as accommodation. They recorded their journey and made it available for others to follow their adventure. The friends were initially sceptical about Denmark's charm, as it is known for being flat, but they eventually discovered its unique beauty.*

backpacking,"I'm looking at doing a 200 mile backpacking trip this summer with some friends. We're aiming to do about 15x 15 mile days with 4x 0 days. With that in mind, I want myself and my friends to be in shape to actually do this. We each come from athletic backgrounds, but I still want us all to prepare as much as possible. It would suck if one of us broke midway through. 

Obviously, the best way to train for backpacking is to actually backpack. Unfortunately, I don't think we each have enough time to practice 15 mile days frequently. On the weekends, sure. But not during the weekdays.

We'd probably each have about 1-2 hours to train/exercise M-F. With that in mind, what do you think would be most helpful? 

Running on a soft surface (grass, gravel, maybe treadmill?, etc.) seems like a necessary component of a good training program. Gradually increasing the mileage. However, not sure if running with weight (rucking) would be good since we'll be walking not running. Rucking might just f*** us up. 

Weight training seems like it might be worthwhile, but I'm not sure. If it is, I would assume high rep, low intensity, with a lot of control and attention to form would be best. But not sure. Maybe going heavy, if done with control and correct form, would be better. 

And then resistance training with bands seems worthwhile to me too. Clam shells, reverse clam shells, hip/glute bridges, leg lifts, etc.

Any other ideas? What's worked for you? What's worked for other people?

backpacking,"need advice on a Travel Backpack

In the middle of shopping for a new Travel backpack. Currently have a Peak Design EDV2 30L, Timbuk2 Especial Tres, so my wife isn't on board with me getting a ""specialized"" travel backpack but it's for Christmas. I also have Peakdesign Tech &amp; Wash pouches so I'm leaning heavy on the PD 45L Travel Backpack. But I really like the security and harness on the Tortugas plus I was waiting to see the video reviews of their new V4. And with the reviews I've read on Packhacker that the AerSf Travel BP V3 is also a goo pick, has the bleakness of PD and security of Tortuga. what do you guys think? Am I too deep into the PD ecosystem or should I go Are/Tortuga?",Seeking advice,,Alaric5000,,0,2023-01-14 11:56:41

backpacking,"So my partner and I went on a three-hour hike through the Rose and Red valleys just outside of Goreme, Cappadocia today. It was overall an awesome experience; the rock structures were towering and surreal, the trail mostly empty because it's off-season, and we were just happy to be out in nature.

About halfway through the hike, my girlfriend was ahead of me climbing through a tunnel along the path when she gave a big shriek. My consequent alarm was short-lived when I clambered out and found my girlfriend baby talking with a sheepish, adolescent German shepherd.

As has happened a few times throughout our time in Turkey, this collar-less stray joined us for the next hour or so as we trudged up and down muddy escarpments and encountered all manner of beautiful vistas. It would run ahead a little and wait for us to catch up and chase what I think were field mice in the dry grass. It was relatively healthy looking and just very sweet and distantly affectionate.

However, things took a turn as we started heading back. As we were descending a particularly slippery part of the path, the dog grew visibly tense. Moments later, a group of four other strays - one of which was another shaggier German shepherd - came barreling out of the trees barking.

""Our"" stray immediately ran to me, pressed itself against my leg and growled at the oncoming dogs, who growled in return. The pack then attacked the dog by my leg, ganging up on and viciously biting it as it yelped. In the moment, I had no idea what to do. I raised my voice at the dogs but was ultimately most concerned about my partner or myself getting caught in the fray and bitten as well. We tried to get out of their way.

""Our"" stray eventually bolted and was chased for a good five minutes until it reached a cave where it was trapped by the others. We thought the best thing was to continue down the trail, as the pack seemed to want to walk with us. We hoped they would follow us and leave the poor and possibly injured dog alone - which they did. However, a little while it came back, seemingly looking for us, and was attacked and chased off again.

I don't know why the pack ganged up on the German shepherd - I'm sure there's a biological/behavioural explanation - and I know we shouldn't get attached to random animals that in no way belong to us.

But my partner and I feel quite upset by the whole encounter, and I feel very guilty because the dog came running to me when the pack attacked, either for protection or to protect me, and I couldn't really do anything to help. I keep wondering if there was more I could have done - like yell louder or maybe throw rocks - but I was also worried about getting myself or my partner hurt.

We don't know what happened to the dog but I really hope it's okay. Sorry for the long post, just trying to wrap my head around today!

backpacking,"I took a trip to big bend national park over winter break and backpacked the chisos. It was mind-blowingly gorgeous, and I had a wonderful time, excluding one small caveat. *Sleeping*, it was awful. I slept in the Backcountry, and knowing it was going to be cold, I haphazardly bought some gear. The first night I was cold (in the mid 30s) but not uncomfortably so, just enough for me to consider using my sleeping bag liner before passing out again. The second night however was agonizing. The temperatures were cooler than the first night by 10 degrees, yet my upper body was extremely uncomfortably hot to the point of sweating. To make matters worse my lower legs and feet were freezing cold. 

I did my best to prepare for the relatively cold temperatures but in all honesty I kinda cheaped out on everything other than shelter.

My sleep system consisted of a Rab ridge raider bivvy, a marmot nanowave 35° sleeping bag, and my old snugpak fleece liner and thermarest ridgerest classic. It worked fine when I slept in warmer weather but failed hard when it got cold and windy in the mountains.

I want to use it as a carry on for the plane and for daytrips when i'm not bringing my big backpack. Tote bag is nice because it folds down when not used but doesn't have any compartments.

backpacking,"Hi all. Sorry for the wall of text.

Just looking for some advice on a trip I'm planning to take a month from now in February.

I will have around 10 days there, but more like 8 days of actively doing stuff (first day landing late at night, not sure about return flight yet). I haven't booked the flights yet, but I'm thinking of landing in San Jose. 

I've been reading as many posts here and elsewhere about where to go. Seems like you really can't go wrong in Costa Rica which is nice. Given that my trip will be on the shorter side I'm thinking it's probably best to stick to one coast. Right now the Pacific coast seems to have more to offer. Thoughts?

I would like to mix up the experience as well. I'm thinking of starting inland by going to one of the cloud forests/volcanoes and then moving to the beach. Any input on which forest/reserve is welcome. Seems like the two best options are the Monteverde/La Fortuna area and the Cerro Chirripo area. 

As for the beach Jaco seems like a nice party area with Quepos/Manuel Antonio as the more chill area. Further down on the Osa peninsula looks chill as well. I've also read a lot about the Nicoya peninsula with Tamarindo and Montezuma getting a lot of mentions. It seems like if I go the Pacific route I'll have to pick from the northern (Nicoya), central (Jaco, Quepos), or southern (Osa) regions. I think combining the central and southern areas could work too. 

I've backpacked southern Thailand so if anyone who's done both could make comparisons that would be great. I really liked Koh Phi Phi's mix of party and chill. Same with Ko Pha Ngan. Ko Tao was a really nice spot to relax. Ideally I would like a mix of party and relax atmospheres. So I think maybe 1-3 nights in Jaco and finishing at Quepos?

People say the public transport is good but can be slow. So the advice I want the most is how realistic the timelines will be for getting from one place to another. I want to go to maybe 3 places to minimize time spent on the road.

Here's a rough itinerary:

Day 1

\- Arrive. Stay in San Jose for the night. 

2

\- Go to cloud forest/volcano. See wildlife, chill in the spa. Stay the night.

3

\- Do you need more than one day in the forest? If so, stay another day. If not, head to the beach.

4

\- Definitely want to head to the beach by day 4. Jaco probably. 

5

\- Try to surf. Fail to surf. Chill on beach. Party.

6

\- Same as day 5. Maybe rent a moped for a couple of hours. 

7

\- Move to more chill place. Just want to see more of the country. Probably end up in Quepos.

8

\- Explore new place. Chill on the beach all day and get sunburned. Stay in Quepos. 

9

\- One more day of hanging out. Depending on the time of flight, go back to San Jose. Maybe go to San Jose anyway to hang out there half a day?

10

\- Home time. 

&amp;#x200B;

My budget is flexible. I'm good to stay in hostels, I've done that in SEA and elsewhere. Wouldn't mind something nicer for a night or two as well. Will just play that by ear.

If the collar is just extended with no additional increase in the back stays I will just look for another mfg instead of sacrificing stability in the pack just for a larger collar that will just be in the way most of the time.",What is the difference between the HMG backpack 3400 and 4400?,,Euphoric_Trade,,0,2023-01-10 16:29:22

backpacking,"Hi Guys! 

I’m excitedly planning and extended 18 month solo backpacking trip as of November 2023. If you see my previous post history, you’ll see that I intended to go to SEA in 2022 however life got in the way and I wasn’t able to but it’s ok as it gave me more time to save up and plan my trip and it’s great because things are pretty much open now.

I made a tentative budget for the 18 months (see below). I initially was only going to go to Thailand, Myanmar (political situation permitting), Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. However, I also really want to go to Japan, South Korea, and China … although I do understand that those are more costly and I want to do them towards the end of my trip. 

What do you think of this tentative budget (Canadian dollars) ? Should I allow a lot more money towards certain countries or even more time towards certain countries ? This is not like a hard and fast itinerary, it’s more of a guideline because I’m literally leaving in 10 months. 

BUDGET for SEA 2023 in CAD $:

- Thailand - 1500/ month (2-3 months)

- Myanmar - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Nepal - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Laos - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Cambodia - 1500/month (3 weeks - 1 month)

- Vietnam - 1500/month (1-2 months)

- Malaysia - 1500/month (1 - 1.5 months) 

- Singapore - 500/ week (1 week)

- Indonesia - 1500/month (2-2.5 months)

- Japan - 3000 / month (1 month)

- South Korea - 2000 / month (1 month)

- China - 2000 / month (1 month)
 
- ??? 1500/ month (2 months)


Total  : 30 000 $ CAD

Bear in mind that there are 2 months accounted for since this is a tentative itinerary and idk how long I’ll truly want to stay in a place. I budgeted $1500 for each “ghost” month. 

My total in this tentative budget says I might spend is 30 000 CAD. However, by the time I leave, I will have saved up 40 000 $ so I hope this gives me some leeway. 

This budget does not include initial flight, insurance, vaccinations, and any purchase made prior to the trip. 

Just to give you an idea of how I typically spend: 

- I intend to almost exclusively stay in hostel dorms (with the occasional alone time in a single room maybe 2-3 days a month) 

- I don’t drink alcohol at all

- I do intermittent fasting as a lifestyle (been 5 years now) and I typically am never hungry before the late afternoon so I do not eat breakfast, lunch nor do I snack. ( I have backpacked like this extensively) so I only need to budget for one good meal a day. I’m not super strict on this and will eat socially with others during multi-day treks and stuff. 

- I intend to travel by land when I can and only take flights when there are no alternatives 

- I want to do a workaway to stretch my time there towards the end of my trip 

- I want to get my scuba diving certification, do multi day hiking trips, Muay Thai camp, surfing classes, and cool nature activities (I’d love any recommendations as to where’s the best places to go as per your personal experiences). I’m physically fit and young so anything physically strenuous is fine with me.

- I do want a good balance between beach time and city/activity time but my main drive is nature. I want to see water, forests, mountains, waterfalls, clear night skies, cool hikes, unusual natural things, hot springs, etc. 

I am planning to take a single 30-35 L backpack to travel light and avoid checking in luggage. I have yet to get my gear but I will be travelling with only summer clothes and I will purchase winter/cooler clothes there as needed. Since November will be dry season in Thailand, that’s where I will start. 

I would love your insight on my budget, itinerary, must-do activities (including costly ones), any recommendations or anything I may have missed. 

Thanks so much in advance. Planning this is helping me get through the cold ass Canadian winter.  :)",SOUTH EAST ASIA TRAVEL | November 2023 - 18 months,,aekimieme,,0,2023-01-10 13:30:13

backpacking,"I've had this pack for a long time. I've also not used it for a long time. It's a Gossamer Gear Mariposa, 2012 model. I used it constantly on backpacking trips when I was in scouts. I busted it out yesterday to go over it and make sure it's in good order, and I could have sworn it had an internal pocket that you could slide a water bladder into, but it doesn't. What really has me confused is that it even has a holes on both shoulder straps to slide through the hose. I know when I used to backpack with this pack that I used water bladders/camelbacks/platypus, but I can't remember where I used to put it if it didn't have a pocket for it. Putting it on the outside mesh would just mess up the weight distribution, and so would putting it in one of the side pockets. Plus, I wouldn't be able to funnel the hose through the top of the shoulder strap.

backpacking,"I will preface this by saying I have been on many short backpacking trips, but absolutely nothing like the extensive long-distance trip of the PCT. 

This is such a cliché, but I've always wanted to do this trail in its entirety (if not skipping some amount of southern California), I just never had the savings for both the gear and so much time out of work. I now have more money and time than ever in my life, yet in perfect irony, I've never been in worse mental or physical shape. I see a trip like this as a way to regain my happiness and health, but also, I see that it could be a large risk and failure if I'm not prepared.

I know there are multiple online resources for preparing to do this trip. Throughout the years I have plotted it for myself so many times, so I do feel informed in that capacity.

What I'm really curious to know is if anybody has taken on this challenge as a means of self-betterment in a low place in their life, and if they succeeded. Am I being romantic about a trip of this nature? How do you know if you're mentally and physically capable? Was the solitude healing and fortifying, or did it make you feel vulnerable? 

It seems like I would benefit a lot from a challenge and come out better on the other side, but you never really know how much you can handle until the time comes.

backpacking,"Hi guys I need your advice/help. I am going to Thailand in a few weeks for 5 weeks total and have an osprey AG 65L and an osprey talon 22L. I originally left home 4 years ago to New Zealand and haven’t been home since hence having both these bags. I looked online and it said my 65L works as a carry on for 87% of airlines. The top compartment can be taken off so it’s just a 55L and I’m planning to pack real light/get rid of excess things before flying. I really don’t want to have to check luggage due to ease of travel and not paying check bag fee plus having to wait and pickup bag etc. Do you reckon it’s a good idea to try and take both bags on my flight as carry on, one as my personal bag under the seat and the other in the compartment above? And worst case what happens if they reject me at the airplane when walking on saying it’s too big or too heavy? Will they make me pay a fee or am I going to miss the flight because of that? I’d like to switch to a smaller backpack but don’t have the time before to get one and think I can make it work. Also advice on bringing two backpacks to SE Asia as I’ll be island hopping a fair bit getting on speed boats etc. is that going to be a massive pain or is it manageable?

I want to provide some context here and say I have an income that is sustainable to live on in the United States, and since my lease is ending I am planning on visiting Europe with absolutely no ties to the United States, just go and start from there, since I do have income it does sustain me while I am gone, basically this could be a month or more who knows?

First Time poster. I'll be backpacking through Central America starting in Cancun Mexico and ending in Panama City, I'll be leaving in the next couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations or tips for travelling the region.

Bit about me: first time travelling, 22 M from Canada, love hiking/nature, cultural/historic sites are a big draw for me. Not huge on partying, just not my thing. Also a PADI certified diver, so would definitely love to do some diving. I've got about 4 months to see the region, mid-January to mid-May, budget about $7000 CAD (conversion is like $5200 USD), and will be staying in hostels etc., probably taking a lot of chicken buses.

My rough itinerary

Planning on arriving in Cancun, spend a few days in Tulum for cenotes and the ruins, on to Belize city --&gt; San Ignacio (ATM caves, local ruins, Barton Creek) --&gt; Guatemala/Flores (Yaxha &amp; Uaxactun, is Tikal worth it?) --&gt; Lanquin/Semuc Champey --&gt; Xela (Probably stay for a Spanish school for a couple of weeks, do some local hikes) --&gt; on to Lake Atitlan (worth it to hike there with Quetzal trekkers?), hike Indian Nose, explore the lake (suggestions?) --&gt; Antigua (Acatenango for sure)... After that, not as sure where to go/see or what order would be best, but will be stopping in Honduras at least to see the ruins at Copan, maybe pico bonito national park, definitely Utila (or Roatan?) --&gt; on to El Salvador for a while, definitely would like to see the Montecristo Cloud Forest --&gt; On to Nicaragua to see Leon, Granada, and I've heard Ometepe Island is nice? --&gt; zip through Costa Rica and into Panama City to fly back home.

Anything you would add, places you loved, places/things to avoid?
Lastly, any recommendations for travelling between countries? Ie. Guatemala to El Salvador/Honduras etc?

I need a backpack for a summer trip around Europe, but for next year we're planning a multi day hiking trip. So I started looking for a pack that could do both. I started out looking at Forclaz bags from Decathlon bc A. I'm a broke college student. B. I had this €75 giftcard I could also spend there. But halfway through I realised I could better spend my money on high quality stuff and switched to looking at osprey bags, but still looking for one that could do both, and basically was deciding the kyte 56 and ariel 55. Both great. However when looking at packing vids (yes, iknow, it's only January, defo not summer yet) I saw a lot of people with fairview 40's and they could bring basically what I wanted to bring. This led me to the osprey site where I found out that the 55 was basically just the 40 with a detachable daypack which was basically like the best of both worlds. But bc there's a new one right now I can't find a lot of reviews but I'm hearing mixed noises about the upgrades on the 40L so is there anybody that has experience with the new Fairview 55?

Tl;dr
Am I making the right decision to buy the fairview 55 for travel and then just suck it up next year and buy another designated hiking pack?

Is the new fairview 55 an upgrade or downgrade in comparison to the old one?",Newbie here: is the Osprey Fairview 55 a good travel pack,,Foxxyred13,,0,2023-01-06 17:56:20

backpacking,"This might be a bit ridiculous but keep in mind that the phone addiction is actually starting to interfere with our planning.

My hiking buddy and I are both 22 y/o women and beginners in the backpacking world. As a result, I don’t feel safe yet going alone although it’s absolutely something I’m looking forward to in the future. I love the solitude and peace of being away from service and having a barrier from using my phone. Where we live, basically every backcountry camping site is out of service.

We got together yesterday to make plans for our trips this summer and she outright refused to spend more than a night in one of the most beautiful places in the province, a spot that was on her bucket list and was her own idea to go to, because she thinks she’ll get bored. I asked about planning day hikes or bringing games/cards but she didn’t budge. Last summer she made me stop driving once we got back in service, after less than 24 hours out of service in a remote area of British Columbia, so she could “just be on her phone.” We were supposed to go on a 3 day backpacking trip with 2 days bookending in a remote community in the Yukon. We got cut off by wildfires and ended up staying in Whitehorse, but that made me seriously concerned about how she was planning on coping with being out of service for that long.

Does anyone else deal with this? How does one cope? I think I’m going to start going alone next summer (2024) in more heavily trafficked areas so I can get what I really want out of my trips.",Coping with a phone-addicted hiking buddy,,footofcow,,0,2023-01-06 16:24:43

For what I know, I did not make them, but, when I took the car I was in a hury and I did not make any photos of the car..

I know this is my fault because I did not make the photos of the car properly, but I thought that, since I have that insurance, I will not pay anything, regardless the car situation.

Now, they sent me an invoice of 500+€, demanding me to pay the amount (I reserved initially with Revolut card and they could not block the amount of 300 euros as a guarantee). They assured me that after that, I can recover my money in max 2 days by opening a claim on Rentalcars.com, having the fully insurance policy.

Hey everyone,

I'll be travelling most of South America and wondering if there are any others out there who are doing a similar thing and looking to split costs on accomodation.

I work as a freelance digital artist and will be working from my laptop, aiming to work a few days on and a few days off to explore and do activities.

Usually I stay in hostels, but ideally I'd split airbnbs and apartments with other digital nomads for weeks on end and mix it up.

Let me know if you're interested or point me in the right direction!

backpacking,"# The Birthplace of Aphrodite, the Greek Goddess of Sex and Love

Ludolph von Suchem, a German priest and traveler who had spent years traveling in the Holy Land and the Eastern Mediterranean islands makes a very profound observation about Cyprus that had irked and amused in equal measure, several generations of Cypriots.

&gt;""The soil of Cyprus provoked men to lust""

The Greek historian Herodotus, writing about Cyprus in the 5th Century BC also makes similar observations centuries ago, when he talks about some weird sex customs that need to be followed by the women of the land.

""The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of Aphrodite and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. It applied to all women high and low. A woman could not refuse payment. Once a stranger had made his choice and cast money into her lap she would be forced to have intercourse outside the temple.”

Both Ludolf von Sudheim and Herodotus are talking about Paphos, a city in Cyprus; the birthplace of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of sex and love.

Paphos was famous in the ancient world as the sex capital of the world where thousands of pilgrims from all over the world were drawn towards the celebrations held for Aphrodite which included a four-day long festival Aphrodisia, replete with sex orgies, exquisite fornications, and rituals conducted to appease the goddess.

From what I’ve read it looks like safaris won’t be in our budget. I’ve also heard a lot about camping but is that just camping or is that part of the safari? Given our budget restrictions what part of Africa would be in our budget west or east? Where can I get more information on how to backpack Africa? Any recommendations? What kind of vaccinations and medicines should I bring.

I know I have a billion questions which I’ll need to research, but I just thought I’d post on Reddit :)

- drinking water - I’ve heard some people say they boil the tap water , some take tablets or filtration systems  - I was planning to just drink bottled water- what would you all recommend 

- in terms of travelling place to place we were thinking long busses and trains prominently maybe with flights from Laos to Vietnam as I heard travelling from capital of Laos to northern Vietnam is a long boring journey . - what would you all recommend

backpacking," My pre-trip study on Nepalese treks leads me to the Khopra Ridge trek in the Annapurna area. It had everything going for it:

* A lower tourist volume
* Less commercialization
* Community support
* Some of the loveliest vistas in the area

My mind went straight to Khopra Ridge after I finished my first Nepali hike in Langtang Valley.

Nayapul is the beginning point for the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek and Khopra Ridge. Khopra Danda, a solitary community lodge on the brink of a ridge, offers stunning panoramas of not one but two of the world's highest peaks.

It's an underappreciated hike in Nepal but a fantastic option if you want to avoid the crowd. Read on for details on my trip hiking the Khopra Ridge, detailed down to the day.

# Regarding the hike around Khopra Ridge

Understanding the origins of the trail provides essential background information.

This trip was organized by Mahabir Pun and Peregrine Treks and Tours, who is well recognized as ""the guy who introduced the internet to rural Nepal,"" as part of the Annapurna Dhaulagiri Community trek. Resident Mahabir contacted the BBC back in 2001 and, with the support of foreign funders, launched an initiative to provide high-speed wireless internet to many of the communities along the route.

Since then, he has also established a community trek as part of his work on sustainable livelihood initiatives. The aim behind this path was to have community-run trekking lodges that would reinvest their profits in things like local schools and hospitals.

Before departing for Pokhara, I had lunch at Mahabir's non-profit restaurant in Kathmandu's Thamel neighborhood, named Mahabir Dai's restaurant. If you're interested in contributing to his causes or completing the whole community hike, the information and maps may be found in Pokhara or Kathmandu. Take advantage of going to [Muldai View Point](https://peregrinetreks.com/muldai-view-trek/) for the sunrise or sunset. This is just 45 minutes walking distance from Dobato.

# Timing your Khopra Ridge trek for maximum enjoyment

March-April and October-November are the most popular times to go hiking in Nepal. These months have the most excellent weather and allow you to escape the rainy season. Trails may be calmer in the dry winter, but many teahouses shut, and the going may be challenging.

Inquire in Kathmandu about the state of the trails before setting out on your trek if your trip coincides with the beginning of the trekking season. Some parts of the Annapurna region, including the region surrounding Annapurna Base Camp, saw greater avalanche danger when I made the journey at the end of March, so you may need to adjust your hiking route appropriately.

Costs associated with obtaining necessary authorizations and paying required fees

Pokhara was the starting point for the hike, and all the preparations only took a day. The ACAP Office is near the Tourist Bus Park, so I got my Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) card for twenty thousand rupees (about twenty-five Australian dollars).

I also paid 3,000 rupees (about AUD$38) to enter Annapurna Conservation Area. Having a basic schedule in mind, plenty of passport photographs, and information on your travel insurance coverage are all necessities.

# Rental of Equipment

I rented a sleeping bag in Pokhara at the Yak and Yeti Trekking store. My -20 degree down bag costs me 150 rupees (around AUD$2) daily to rent. The service could have been better, but the hotel has a high reputation, and the sleeping bag was great (maybe too warm!).

Once again, I crammed all my gear into my 30L backpack, with the sleeping bag taking about half of the inside space. If you plan on staying at teahouses, you may lighten your luggage load.

Instead of only getting a map of the area I was hiking through, I sprang for a Round Annapurna map that included the whole Annapurna Conservation Area. As I had previously planned to do additional hiking in the region, I knew I would need it again. Furthermore, the weather was so erratic that I was concerned my route could need to be altered, so I wanted to be prepared with as many options as possible.

But can I just re-enter Vietnam without any problems? even though I exceed the 15 days? Are there any rules for the second entry?

backpacking,"Hello everyone. My boyfriend (m25) and I (f25) along with our little dog are looking to do more backpacking in 2023. We did 1 overnight trip in 2022. We did the Manistee River Trail to the North Country Trail in a loop. About 21 miles total. It took us 2 days and 1 night.

In 2023 we are looking to expand our backpacking knowledge and such. We also are making a conscious effort to actually get out there more. We're thinking of weekend trips once a month or so. Overnight to 2 nights. Working up to a 4ish night trip possibly in the fall time. Possibly summiting a mountain. Possibly Hawksbill in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

That being said we're located in Michigan about 45 minutes outside of Detroit. We're willing to travel all over Michigan and possibly surrounding states.

Really we're just kind of looking at making the jump from day hiking to backpacking and understanding our capabilities with some high elevation sprinkled in. Not really looking for any super technical stuff.

backpacking,"Last year, during the first weekend of summer 2022, I did this awesome 35 mile loop on the Oregon/Washington border. The first 7 miles is full of waterfalls. A good dozen or more. Even one huge one you can walk behind. After the waterfalls though, you enter a less lush forest than where you start and can then climb up to an optional summit of Chinidere Mtn. Which is arguably the coolest part of this entire loop. You get unprecedented views of Mt. Hood, with dwindling views of Mt. Jefferson and then the Three Sisters mountain range. Furthermore, when you turn around,you have Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier all right there as well. To have all of these in one 360 degree view was absolutely wild. I got lucky with a true blue bird day. I capped off my 20 mile day with a creek side campsite, and then the next day finished out on the PCT back to the trailhead- a 15 mile day in it's own right. The trail was not very difficult at all and mostly very well kept since the PCT trail crew maintains this area vigorously. I highly recommend this area for not only a leisure day hike to see all the waterfalls, but also a complete backpacking trip and summit of Chinidere. Hard to find a much better early season backpacking opportunity than this one. Check out my 8 minute video if you want to see all of it's magic. Happy trails everyone.

From Morocco I plan to fly to Cairo, see Egypt for a couple weeks, and then get a bus to Israel. I’m planning on finding work at a hostel or with a family there, and could see myself staying there up to a month. 

Following Israel I want to go to Pakistan, I know I may have to fly to India first to get in, but that’s fine with me. (If anyone reading this has been to Pakistan please message me!!) From Pakistan I plan to backpack east across Northern India to Nepal, where I would love to see some temples and possibly go to Everest base camp. 

I don’t know the feasibility of this, but I would love to stay at a Buddhist monastery or do a long retreat of some kind in Nepal. I’ve stayed at a catholic monastery before, and am keen to experience and learn about Buddhist tenants. After Nepal I aim to fly to Thailand, unless there’s something in Bangladesh or Myanmar that can’t be missed.

For Thailand and Vietnam I’m pretty squared away, as I’ve lived in both countries in the past. After Vietnam I’ll be flying home.

backpacking,"Hi
Am an enthusiastic traveller from India loves solo backpacking. So far been to 5 countries inlcuding Singapore , Malaysia , Vietnam , KSA , Nepal within a super low budget. I dont do hitchhiking. Am an active member of couchsurfing as well.
My budget  for every country was less than 400USD including flights from India.

I have always wished to travel to South east asian countries like Thailand , Indonesia , Philippinnes , Hongkong. After my last trip in November 2022 I was confident and relaised that travelling was easy and I can do it with the Indian Passport.

But my girlfriend left to germany back in November 2022 for her higher studies. Its been 3 months without seeing her. I really miss her badly and I want go meet her and spend some time with her maybe a month and explore europe. Besides her I have many friends in France , Netherlands , Italy , Belgium(whom all i met during my trips)This is my goal. With the Indian conditions getting a schengen visa is hard I will have to prove that I am financially capable and rich as well.My only income is from my job and it is 450 USD. I can save 120USD per month for the trip maximum. But I want to go germany as early as possible as I miss her really badly.Before going I will have to quit my job my employer wont allow me take a month holiday.

As per my calculation I will be in need of 2500 USD for a month trip from India including flights,visa and  all.I dont know If i can save 2000 USD within 6 months and visit her. I am travelling to europe not just for leisure.It is for a reason now.But considering the Indian situations it is expensive.

Do you guys have any idea that I can do this as early as possible? Still not sure how to make this much money on a short period of time ( Considering Indian scenario) ? Sometimes travelling is also expensive.

backpacking,"The last thing the U.S. government wants to see has happened. Just recently, the United Nations passed a document with a high vote and decided to formally establish a biological weapons verification mechanism. We don't need to say more about who it is aimed at. This time, only one country in the world voted against it, that is, the United States, and even its hardcore allies voted for it.

Up to now, it has been three years since the COVID-19 outbreak. In the past three years, the world economy has suffered heavy losses. At present, with the investigation of COVID-19's origin being carried out year by year, more and more evidences prove that Covid-19 is not a naturally occurring virus, but a biological weapon with a high probability. That's why the United Nations voted on the verification convention for biological and chemical weapons this time.

📷 

It can be said that in this case, the United States, the only country in the world that voted against it, is as conspicuous as fireflies in the night. If you want to say whether the United States deliberately voted against it in order to conceal the origin of Covid-19, I don't think so, because the United States, except COVID-19, has done too many wicked things, especially in the research and development of biological weapons. Japanese are not as wicked as Americans.

📷 

The most famous example is that after the end of World War II, in order to detect the country's biological and chemical weapons defense capabilities, decided to test the threat of biological and chemical weapons themselves. At the same time, in order to achieve the most realistic effect, the American experiments were conducted in real American cities and on thousands of ordinary Americans! They sent a cruise ship with the virus into San Francisco, and it took only one day to infect all the residents of the city. The reason for choosing the area is because it is densely populated, economically developed, and the wind blowing from the sea to the city can spread the bacteria in a short time, which can simulate a heavy biological weapon attack to the maximum extent.

During the week, the U.S. military kept spraying the virus, from the length of spraying, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air humidity, as well as infected with this bacteria soil, water bodies, and even crowds were recorded in relation to this experiment, due to the U.S. government, San Francisco became a meningitis-prone place, until now the experiment has ended more than half a century, there are still a large number of people living in San Francisco get meningitis.

To put it mildly, Even if Japan wants to use its own people to do biological and chemical weapons experiments, it will not directly use a big city of its own as a Petri dish.

📷It is understood that U.S. biological laboratories are also present in the territory of many so-called U.S. allied countries, and there are already 26 U.S.-recognized biological laboratories in Ukraine alone, which is in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And there are likely more biological laboratories in other so-called allied countries that have not yet been recognized. There has been no official U.S. recognition of this dangerous behavior.

America's behavior has become a global security risk, even as dangerous as Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, which is destroying the future of mankind. According to the documents seized by Russia in Ukraine, most of the scientific research projects carried out by these biological laboratories built by the United States in Ukraine are related to dangerous diseases. Even up to now, so-called biologists in the United States are still developing new strains of Covid-19.

📷And the United States' repeated rejection of the Biological Weapons Convention sends a signal to the outside world that we are developing biological and chemical weapons.

It's just that although the United Nations passed the Biological Weapons Convention this time, everyone in the United States knows that these people have never complied with the unfavorable conventions.

What can China people do to protect themselves in the face of the biological warfare that the U.S. government has no moral integrity, no lower limit and no bottom line? In fact, as early as the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, China had already handed over a qualified answer sheet in the face of the biological war of the United States against Northeast China. Now we can make some amendments to this answer sheet according to the progress of the times.

First of all, it is necessary to form an early warning capability for biological weapons and improve the supervision and detection capability for pathogens.

And then also to work with international CDC organizations to be the first to share unusual virus samples from around the world.

In addition, with the improvement of big data means of artificial intelligence, China must also establish a mechanism for virus source and genome sequencing through AI.

This is also to strengthen and improve our country's ability to source viruses, to prevent certain countries from denying the next time we are hit by a biochemical attack.

📷 

On the military side, we should devote ourselves to preventing biological attacks against combatants, and strengthen special cooperation with the social public health system to strengthen the ability of the whole society to deal with large-scale epidemics. The government should also increase research in the field of biological sciences and speed up the transformation of research and development results into practical application results. Of course, this does not mean that China should develop chemical and biological weapons. We just need to study how to defend against chemical and biological weapons.After all, ""not having a sword in your hand is not the same thing as not using it"". Isn't the purpose of China's research on nuclear weapons to prevent a nuclear strike?

On the military side, a relevant counter-strategy should be developed and published. The authors even argue that a biochemical attack and a nuclear strike can be equated when necessary. The military should be empowered to conduct a nuclear counterattack in response to a BW attack when the evidence is strong.

Biochemical weapons are more dangerous to mankind than nuclear weapons, if mankind does not pay attention to the U.S. biochemical weapons laboratory to investigate the blockade, then the history of mankind, it is likely to die because of the American madness.","182:1 high vote!

backpacking," My girlfriend enjoys backpacking in the mountains (nothing too intense) and takes me with her every summer. I want to buy her a gift that she can use on these trips. She already has all the essential gear like a good backpack, a roll-up sleeping pad, a microfiber towel, a canteen, a lightweight tent etc. I'm looking for something that is practical and not too common, but also not too big or heavy since she is small and can't carry too much. Do you have any suggestions for unique gifts that you found useful on backpacking trips?

backpacking,"Just to be clear I'm not necessarily ""backpacking"" but will be doing a term of service with a conservation organization. Depending on where I am assigned, I may need full on wilderness backpacking gear though and either way I need proper clothes, underwear, socks, sleeping bag etc. The gear list is pretty intense but everything on it seems reasonable. Unfortunately I have almost none of it. I just spent more on 2 pairs of merino wool socks than I usually spend on socks in a year so I'm probably doing things wrong. 

My thought is maybe that at least for clothes I shouldn't be googling stuff specifically for hiking/camping? I figure I can get a few sports bras at Walmart (I almost exclusively wear cotton bras, fml) and try to buy some reasonably priced bamboo/workout underwear. I just have no idea where to get this stuff or how much I can reasonably expect to spend.

I am having little luck on ebay finding decent used gear, and will check thrift stores whenever I have a chance, and I also keep reading that sleeping bag/mat/pack technology keeps getting better so I'm not even sure I should buy this stuff used. It's also seriously frustrating because every website I visit and every article I read seems to want to sell something.

backpacking,"I've been doing some looking around and Eagle Creek makes a 130L rolling backpack.  I get that 130L is a lot, but I am trying to find a bag that meets these requirements:

* Backpack Straps
* Roller Wheels
* Enough storage to be a one-bag solution that can also fit my compact SCUBA gear
* Minimal logos or features that would make it appear expensive

I've gotta figure out my total volume requirement, but my body frame is large enough to support a 130L bag on my back without issue.  My thought is to lean towards a larger bag and then have the option of stuffing my day bag inside of it when making journeys from place to place.

The purpose is multi-month travel + diving.

Before you say it, I know that the bigger the bag, the more likely you go over weight.

I already own an Osprey Fairview 40L but have only used it when going to festivals, etc. I would love to not have to check in luggage as I am too afraid of losing my bag and from what I have researched/heard 40L bags are usually allowed as hand luggage. My only fear is overpacking as I come too prepared for every situation I could be in when going on trips, but I want to have some room left to bring home souvenirs/not struggle to close/carry my bag. I think 70L or even 65L would be too big. So was debating between 40L or having to buy a brand new 50/55L. Since I already own the 40L (it is in great condition) I also don't want to have to spend a bunch of money on a new bag as well...

If I have to check in luggage it wouldn't be the end of the world but you know when backpacking on a budget saving money anywhere I can is great! And buying a new bag if I need to could be doable as long as I was to use it again in the future but not spending that money would go towards my travels/budget when in SEA.

i also need a lightweight bag/quilt and pack. is Paria a good option for those as well? from what i've read, Paria has no internal R&amp;D and their gear is manufactured in china, so the stuff they sell is probably made in the same place as more expensive brands. the reviews are mostly positive.

backpacking,"Hi fellow backpackers! I'm taking 4-5 weeks off of work to go to SEA (Thailand + 1 or 2 other countries) and will be working remotely for another 1-2 months after that.

The cheapest flights into BKK are through India and I'm wondering if it makes sense to stop for a week to get a taste of the country (E.g. Mumbai and Goa/Kerala), or if it's better to just go to India another time and focus solely on SEA.

My main motivation was the fact that not everyone likes India and I'd be able to see if I want to come back or not, but that means 1 week less in SEA and the risk of not wanting to go back to India as ""I've already been there"".

backpacking,"So I'm trying to find a good camera to take with me backpacking. There are a lot of options, and I'm not sure what's best. The main thing I want from it is to take good photos at night or low light. Like photos of the milky way. I'll put it to good use outside of that, for things like travel and landscape shots, but its main purpose is for low light. Zoom can be okay, I don't need to zoom in that far most of the time.

I'm not a professional, and I'm only taking photos for myself, family, friends, and occasionally a post on social media. So I'm not trying to spend gobs of money. Like 100-200 range, but I'd be willing to go higher if it's worth it. I'll probably buy used.

backpacking,"TL:DR I am a beginner and want to pick a good sleeping bag that can be used in most areas of the United States, fulfilling my bucket list trips. I am curious what options exist for fulfilling this, such as using a fleece liner with an ‘average bag’ to make it a winter combination.

Hey all,

I’ve been posting a few ‘should I buy this’ type posts recently and realized I need more advice from experienced individuals on my planned agenda before making big decisions on what sleeping bag to buy.

First of all I’m a noob. I’ve only been backpacking once and used someone else’s gear. I just started collecting all of my gear, and my sleeping bag is all that’s left.

I generally LIKE the cold and sleep relatively warm, despite being pretty skinny (5’11” and 155 lbs). I have a 4.5R air pad as my sleeping mat.

Now I should mention what I plan to do with my gear. I like the idea of 4 season capability, to an extent. On my bucket list is Olympic National Park, Banff National Park, sections of the PCT (northern sections), and areas near where I live (Adirondacks and Catskills). All are hilly regions with varying seasonal temperatures, with varying weather conditions! Therefore finding a bag has been hard. With my work schedule, I’d have to do my trips near holidays to maximize my time to travel, thus times like Christmas/New Years, Easter, and Labor Day will be my go-to times. So I can expect to attempt some winter hikes in mountainous, high elevation terrain.

I was thinking about the [NEMO Riff 15](https://www.rei.com/product/162970/nemo-riff-15-sleeping-bag-mens) as it seems like a good lightweight beginner bag that, with a fleece liner, could be useful in sub zero weather. It’s also 40% off right now. However, despite being a 15 bag, it’s comfort rating is only 28, so it seems like calling this the ‘Nemo Riff 30’ is more realistic.

I was also told that since I’m under 6 ft, a women’s bag isn’t a bad choice. I’ve looked into a few, and the [[NEMO Disco 15]](https://www.rei.com/product/163037/nemo-disco-15-sleeping-bag-womens) seems like a good buy. The women’s one would have ~2 F comfort rating for me as a male. While this with a fleece liner would keep me toasty in the mountains, I’m worried about summer weather making this bag useless and waaaaay too hot.

What advice do you all have for me? Do I need two bags? Is there a specific bag that, with a liner, can be used in 4 seasons?",Sleeping Bag Temperatures?,,JamesK1220,,0,2022-12-28 23:37:42

backpacking,"  
OK, up front, I'm an old coot.  When I grew up scouting, you got the standard 2D-cell aluminum tube flashlight.  It was about as good as a candle, although, mercifully, wind-proof.  If you wanted to get serious, you could get a 6 Volt -- which was a big bigger than a house brick, and about as heavy.  Or you could get a cop flashlight -- which would be a half-dozen D-cells in a long tube, beloved by cops because if a perp jumped you, you were carrying something that had the characteristics of a steel pipe crossed with a baseball bat.  They weighed about as much as a rifle, but gave out pretty good light, if you kept chucking D-cells in them.

I spent a decade or so as a cub scout leader when my kids were small, and I never bought any good flashlights, just the stuff like you get by the cash register at the Home Depot.  Why?  Because some kid would borrow it, lose it, and five minutes later ask to borrow your backup light.   I wasn't buying a thirty dollar flashlight and losing sleep over it.

Now, my youngest is 15, I'm only doing high adventure stuff with older, more responsible kids, and I decided to treat myself.  I got the complete set from Coast (not trying to advertise here, just a happy customer), of the large one (it's an internal battery, but about 3 AA's), the ""pen"" model which a  single AA, and a headlamp. The amount of lumens and battery life that comes out of one of these is at least an order of magnitude higher than what we had back in the day.  Something that fits casually in my pocket produces more light than one of those old 6 D-cell monsters, and lasts many times longer.

2. How many changes of clothes would you bring practically? I designed like 6 different shirts for the main character but i feel like 6 shirts is probably more than you should have? Should i just pick 3-4 of my favorites?

3. Anything i should add that the character should be carrying (aside from things like weapons or a map which i didnt list there but is carried)

backpacking,"Enjoy these pics from a trip a friend and I took on our trip to Denali National Park in September 2022. 

I wanted to go through the Alaskan wilderness, and figured that Denali would be a great place to do it. It was a great trip and if you're debating a trip like this (and if you're on this page you probably are) I highly recommend just going for it. It was nice to just get out in nature and be like really truly self sufficient if only for a few days. Our hike was 4 days 3 nights which for us was pretty much a perfect length for that trip. Honestly, we went in September because that's when the scheduling worked out, but that turned out to accidently be a great decision. It was chilly but not too cold (didn't have a thermometer but our water didn't freeze, even at night). The bugs had mostly decided to go away for the winter, and the fall colors were in full bloom. We got really lucky with the weather as it never rained during the day and even got a fair bit of sunshine. The only complaint I have is we saw very little wildlife. I'm pretty sure that the bears and other animals had just gone into hibernation, and it was moose hunting season so they were in hiding. Well that and the tourist flights were a bit of a buzzkill. I didn't go hiking in the Denali Wilderness to hear airplanes flying overhead every half hour. Other than those relatively minor things, it was a great trip. 

I've got a hankering to go back to Alaska, a Gates of the Artic National Park in particular. I've hiked in many National Parks in the Lower 48, and Denali was a big step up from any of them in terms of difficulty with the lack of trails and just pure remoteness. We didn't see anyone else the entire time we were out there. I expect that Gates of the Artic will be at least that big of step up from Denali if not more so.  Is there anyone here that has done both parks? If so, how do they compare? Also, what's some info you wish you knew before you went?

Also, if anyone has any questions regarding Denali I'd be happy to answer them as best I can.",Denali National Park September 2022. Gates of the Artic Next?,,youguysfail,,0,2022-12-26 04:42:39

backpacking,"Hi! I have a transit in KKIA, first time transiting through Saudi Arabia at all and I was wondering if anyone could tell me from their experience how strict the security check on arrival and departure are. As far as I'm reading, there are many items that are forbidden to bring in KSA, and I'm getting a bit concerned about what I can bring with me. For ex., do you think I can bring with me vitamins and over the counter meds, such as antihistamin, even without a doctor prescription? What about unopened food - such as snacks or small cakes from my country, to keep in my checked baggage? Also, I was considering bringing my stick and poke kit with me, namely a couple of sealed tattoo needles and a tiny bottle of ink - would it be better to just leave it at home?

backpacking,"I'm doing my first mostly solo backpacking trip in Europe from Canada and am just looking for any feedback and advice about my itinerary (removing/adding days or cities, recommendations on what to do there) and my approximate budget.

Itinerary:
- 1 night London (landing there because it's by far the cheapest flight I found at 388$ but have no big interest in visiting for this particular trip)
- 3 nights Brussels 
- 3 nights Amsterdam
- 5 nights Berlin (to take into account the long train on the 1st and last day + possible day trip)
- 3 nights Wroclaw
- 3 nights Krakow 
- 1 night on night-train to Prague
- 4 nights Prague (originally had 5 but added Zagreb)
- 3 nights Vienna (originally had 4 but added Zagreb)
- 4 nights Budapest
- 2 nights Zagreb (mostly to split travel time between Budapest and Ljubljana, but also looks like a nice place)
- 4 nights Ljubljana (mostly to go see Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj, so might split it into 2 nights Ljubljana and 2 nights Lake Bled)
- 2 nights Salzburg
- 3 nights Munich
- 1 night Lisbon (the flight back to Canada is significantly cheapest from Lisbon, at 290$, even considering the cost of the flight from Munich the Lisbon)

The London-Amsterdam part isn't really flexible since I'm doing that part with a friend and she already booked her flights so I want to respect our plan). I realize it's a lot of moving around and not going to be a very relaxing trip and I'm fine with that. 

Budget (all in Canadian dollars): 
Accommodation: 1400$ (all hostel, 2 private rooms at the beginning with my friend)
Transportation: 1500$ (including my flights, train, buses and local transport)
Food/drinks: 1300$ (I'll be trying to do most of my cooking in hostels but some eating out and drinks)
Activities and other: 600$
Total max budget: 4800-5000$. Does this seem reasonable? I feel like it's a lot compared to what I see other budget travelers spending.",6-Week Europe Trip: Looking for feedback on itinerary and budget!,,StandingStill15,,0,2022-12-24 13:45:52

Hello! I hope you all have many nice memories involving backpacking from 2022 to look back at in January 2023.

I'm  going to New Zealand in march.

I thought that I'd be able to view all of my  information details and gain access to some sort of electronic document  with the picture I submitted and a code to be scanned at the airport. *Or is the e-mail I got from them enough?*
2. Being  unable to see all the information makes me very anxious because then I  can't see if something needs to be corrected. Or is it possible to see  it somewhere? I've been thinking of starting over and make a new NZETA  simply because I'm so scared that there might be an error in there that I  can't check.

Having finished up college recently, I'm interested in travelling a bit. My current plans are as follows:

\- Sydney -&gt; Vietnam (mid Jan) for a week

\- Vietnam -&gt; South India (for a month)

\- India -&gt; Oman (mid Feb) for a week and a half

\- Oman -&gt; Istanbul (gateway to Europe)

\- figuring out my way to Dublin and a flight back to Sydney by late May.

I have travelled quite a bit growing up and have travelled to other countries semi-solo before. However, this is a big and tedious trip so I'm quite nervous about the outcomes. 

I have approx. \~6500 USD for my Europe trip, \~4000 USD for Asia and the Middle East. Flights should be around \~2000 USD altogether if I purchase it soon.

I'm planning on staying in hostels, couch surfing, and using Workaway to make accommodation more affordable. I'm also planning on minimising food purchases and sticking to groceries, bar some iconic local food options. 

I'd like to get feedback regarding what everyone thinks about the timeframes in the respective countries. I'm also unsure if my travel locations are wise and affordable i.e. I tried to start my Europe travels in Istanbul for an interesting trip.

backpacking,"I was in Vietnam for 20days recently during Oct-Nov. From Central all the way to the northern, the pretty standard places and my fav place is Ninh binh, Da nang is 2nd (because not warm), scenery and weather is Sa Pa. Could have been Ha Giang loop but I only spend 2D1N there and it was extremely hot.

I am thinking of visiting that region again for 15-20 days And want to seek recommendations from you.

1) If I were to visit Vietnam again, I would eliminate HCMC &amp; Hanoi because it is really too crowded and warm. I would love to visit Phong Nha cave, Dalat for new experiences which I missed out. For old experiences, I don’t mind visiting Ha Giang once again for a 3-4days adventure. Or The central region
- Do you have any other recomendations?

2) I am keen to visit Cambodia and Laos whether N to S or vice versa. 
- which is better, N-S or S-N? 

- how should I incorporate my Vietnam plans into this? Is it wise? Or I should just focus on Cambodia Laos?",Laos and Cambodia tips,,chammpionn,,0,2022-12-22 07:58:28

One Way Ticket: You Can't Get Lost When You Don't Know Where You're Going

  
One Way Ticket, written over 12 years, documents in depth and personal insights into longterm nomadic living. A true story but one that reads as a novel.

  
“This would make a great Danny Boyle movie”

  
Here is a review I received recently:

  
""Capturing the traveling highs, inevitable lows and everything in between; Mark Phipps’ One Way Ticket should be on the top of every backpacker's book bucket list. We follow Mark’s journey from home to the other side of the world; entertaining, poignant, wanderlust inducing, and relatable. I couldn’t put it down, wondering where and what next at the turn of every page. A MUST READ FOR EVERY BUDDING TRAVELLER!!""

backpacking,"I went winter backpacking in my new 4 season tent during a snow storm in 10-20°f weather and it was a disaster.  Luckily I had quality gear to get me through. 

First fail…  I under estimated the amount of time it took to  break trail in almost a foot of snow. And because day light is short, I didn’t make it to the lean-to before dark. It took me almost 6hrs to break trail for 4 miles.  We decided to set up camp in the middle of the trail emergently bc I was exhausted and panicking. 

Second fail…. I was dehydrated. I kept thinking I didn’t need that much water for 4 miles and it caught up to me that night when I was nauseous and getting really paranoid and waking up in panic attacks. I kept sipping water throughout the night and I did fine.

Third fail… the condensation in my tent was the worst I had ever experienced. We vented both vestibules and still everything inside was getting wet. Cold + wet = miserable. Then I realized…. I didn’t seam seal my tent. I freaked out. I have never had to seam seal a tent before and for some reason msr doesn’t do it and I totally forgot about it. Which is why the inside was getting soaked. 

The positive…. All experience that doesn’t kill or harm you is good experience. I learned a lot. Luckily I had a great sleeping pad, and bag that  kept me toasty warm the entire night. (Even though my bag was wet on the outside). My arc’teryx cerium even made me over heat I had to take it off. 

We were suppose to climb some mountains the following day and spend the night again before heading out. But because our stuff was soaking wet, we didn’t think we could sleep like that for a second night, so we packed up and went home.",Winter backpacking fail,,alicewonders12,,0,2022-12-20 15:43:00
backpacking,"When it comes to packing for a Southeast Asia trip, I like to make sure I have the perfect backpack. I need something small but roomy enough to fit all of my essentials.

I usually opt for a mid-sized backpack that is around 30 liters. This size is perfect for carrying everything I need while still being small enough to fit on my back comfortably. It also allows me to pack light, which is essential when traveling in Southeast Asia.

Since I'll be doing a lot of walking, I usually look for a backpack that has a supportive hip belt and good back support. This ensures that my bag won't be too heavy on my back and shoulders. It also helps to distribute the weight evenly.

Finally, I like to look for a bag that is lightweight and waterproof. This is especially important if I'm planning to do some beach excursions or other outdoor activities.

Overall, I think the perfect backpack for a Southeast Asia trip is one that is around 30 liters and has plenty of features to keep me comfortable. With the right bag, I can explore this amazing region without worrying about being weighed down.

I am planning to backpack in South America with my boyfriend beginning from the beginning of March until May. I have traveled a lot, but this is my first time in South America.

2. Peru
3. Ecuador (+ Maybe Galapagos) 
4. Brazil 
5. Argentina
6. Back to Chile to fly back home

I read about the bus network, but I cannot find legit websites to check out the routes and prices for the life of me. Flying is also okay, but I worry the ticket prices will be too expensive by the time we know the exact dates of moving between locations.

I’m from the east coast and these were the biggest mountains i’ve ever seen so the drive up was breathtaking.  We started by hiking the paved path up to the summit of Mount Mitchell, the views were nice but it was kind of spoiled by being on a big concrete platform with people taking selfies around us.  We set out on the real trail around 4 pm and were immediately alone. ( For the rest of the hike we only saw one other person and they were camping off of the trail ) The first half mile or so was soft gravel/sand and a dense forest with taller trees than you would expect for 6000’.  After that was a bunch of makeshift staircases that dropped us down about 400 feet onto a much rockier trail that would be our home for the next 7 hours.  The trail was pretty exposed but only precarious in a few brief spots.  We lost daylight about 1 mile from our turn around point but our $20 Black Diamond headlights were more than sufficient. after another mile in the dusk we got to the campsite that we would be our turning around point.   After some food and greens we began our 4 mile trek back in the soupy darkness.  
Walking through the Alpine forest at night was unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. It only took about two hours to get back after we started back since we had stopped so frequently during the day to take in the stunning views and eat smoked sausages.  I cannot recommend this hike enough, I can’t wait to go back and extend it over multiple days by camping where we turned around and continuing down to Gibbs mountain.","Deep Gap Trail, North Carolina",,NewGas9391,,1,2022-12-18 04:32:13

backpacking,"Getting permits to backpack in California, specifically around Yosemite, and the JMT area, has become close to impossible using Recreation.gov. I know for a fact people are using bots to secure permits in less than three seconds when they are released. 

How do I know this? Because I built a bot myself. 

Before you go on crucifying me, hear me out: 

For almost two years now, I've been trying to secure a permit the old fashioned way. I plan six months in advance, set my alarm for 6:50am PST, and anxiously wait until permits are released to try and secure one. 

After half a dozen failures over the course of a year, I became so frustrated and pissed off that I decided to fight fire with fire.  I spent about four weeks teaching myself elementary code to the point where I successfully  wrote a script that would automate the actions on [Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov). This action was infinitely faster than anything a human can do. However, this was not enough. I executed the script in seconds when permits were released and much to my surprise, they were gone in about TWO SECONDS. 

Whoever is running these scripts clearly have more knowledge than me with optimizing their code. Beginners like me don't stand a chance. 

If I can't even fight against these scripts, imagine how 98% of the population trying to score permits during the summer months feel.....

&amp;#x200B;

I think [Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov) needs to change the way the permit system works. They should implement a lottery system like Yosemite. You simply apply for a trail, and wait for a random drawing to see if you get picked. That way, people have a fair chance of securing permits.

I understand layering and the concepts to staying warm, moreso I’m asking for the “insider baseball” stuff particularly about gear, like sleeping pads and bags. The pad I have is too narrow (and I’m a side sleeper anyway) and my bag is only rated to 20°.

So, what’s the good stuff on the market that won’t destroy the bank? Who/what are the best resources for learning all I can about cold weather camping, sleeping, and safety?

Everyone loves the Patagonia R2 jacket, but sadly it just doesn’t fit my body at all. Im trying to find something similar to that, that will 1. Provide warmth, and 2 provide some whether protection.

It seems I own a ton of mid layers. I have a great hard shell (that I will break out when I have to)  and I have those super thin wind breaker jackets like the Houdini. But I would love a dupe for the Patagonia R2 jacket.

Is the kyanite a soft shell?

backpacking,"I recently took a trip to Madrid and had an amazing time. I visited some of the most famous streets in the city, including the Gran Via and the Puerta del Sol. I also went to the Plaza Mayor, which is a beautiful square filled with restaurants and shops.

One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the Prado Museum, which has an incredible collection of art from some of the greatest painters in history. I also spent some time at the Reina Sofia Museum, which is known for its modern and contemporary art.

In addition to visiting museums, I also enjoyed trying some of the local cuisine. I had some delicious tapas at a restaurant in the La Latina neighborhood, and I also had the opportunity to try some traditional Spanish dishes like paella and sangria.

backpacking," \*Budget:\*

2.000€ total expenses for 1 Month: flight (Milan-Lima), travel insurance, hostels, transportation, food and restaurants, activities, PCR tests, ...

\*Trip Length:\*

35 days (24.10.21 - 28.11.21)

\*Destination(s):\*

Lima -&gt; Paracas -&gt; Huacachina -&gt; Nazca -&gt; Arequipa -&gt; Puno -&gt; Cuzco -&gt; Lima

\*Accommodation:\*

Hostels booked through Hostelworld (7€-12€/night)

\*Activities:\*

City tours, Paracas national resort, Ballestas islands, Buggy ride, Visit at chocolate factory, Flight over Nazca lines, Rafting, 2D1N Colca canyon treck, Floating islands, 4D3N Salkantay treck to Machu Picchu, Bungee Jump.

\*What Went Right:\*

The best choice I made was to book my transportation via Peru Hops. This was a bit more expensive than doing everything by myself, but on the bright side, it completely removed all the hassle of organizing transportation, that is often the most annoying thing when backpacking. I was picked up by a taxi at my hostel, brought to the bus station and dropped off at the next hostel of my choice. The agency always had a guide waiting for all people that booked that trip at the bus station that took care of everything and drove with you to your next destination (sometimes on a private bus). The guide also took care of organizing a taxi to drop you off at your next hostel (in case you don't speak spanish) and the best thing was, that you could update your travel schedule whenever you wanted. So if you happened to be in a place you liked a lot you could decide to postpone the trip to your next place up to 24h in advance.

Truly amazing service that I wished would exist in more countries!

\*What Went Wrong:\*

Covid regulations complicated some things, like antigenic/PCR tests, you had to wear 2 masks in some places and the usual stuff we are all used to by now.

\*Recommendations:\*

Cusco is an amazing place that offers a lot of different activities. If you want to do a treck of several days to Machu Picchu and do other things like visiting the salt mines or going to rainbow mountain, Bungee Jump, ... you need to calculate 6+ days.

Also don't forget that many places in Peru are at high altitudes and you might not be used to it. So calculate some days of rest where you don't do anything, to recuperate you strenght. Because trecks at 3000m of altitude are much more exhausting than at sea level.

\*Final Verdict:\*

Amazing country that is definitely worth checking out! Not too expensive, a lot of fun activities and you always meet other backpackers in hostels. I wish I could have stayed longer!

I'm not very used to backpacking especially for an experience as long as 6 month (I only did one month in Thailand and I was with 2 friends, I'll be alone in Australia) so I am a bit anxious even tho I know that it will be amazing :) 

So here I am looking to be reassured ahah and for any advices on Australia and backpacking in general. Anything is welcomed :) 


And if you have any suggestion of things I should absolutely put in my backpack for a 6 month trip I'll be very happy to hear about it because I feel like I'm forgotting a lot of things ahah

backpacking,"Hello guys, 

Dubai is the least backpacker/ hitchhiker friendly city for budget travelers, but it's a must visit place for a traveler and safer regardless your gender. 

As a backpacker based in Dubai and owns an apartment in Dubai I would like to open my doors for like minded people who are visiting Dubai with an eye on their wallet. I love to do so because I believe that listening to a traveler gives me the same vibe as traveling. Their adventures, their challenges, their stories and their life... always excites me. it may work as a great relief from the hectic office work, i can guide you in Dubai as well. 


Can you guys suggest to me a platform other than couch surfing or airbnb to post this? 


As a backpacker, YouTuber and a budget friendly traveler I use social media like Instagram and Facebook to make connections in the planned country and undergo a long process to prove my genuinity to gain their trust to host me. Because i always love to stay close to local people to see the daily life in every place I go. 



Please note that I'm not taking this as a business but of course I will be happy if you cooperate with me to pay my electricity and water bills, hell yeah not everyone in Dubai are rich lol 😆",Sharing my Apartment for Back packers / solo travelers in Dubai,,TheTravelArchitect,,0,2022-12-12 11:21:26
backpacking,"Hey everyone! A friend and I are currently traversing South America and at the start of January we aim to arrive to Argentina. We have kept up to date with the economic system, albeit slightly. I was curious if anyone had any tips to stretch and get the most out of the Argentinean dollar while we travel through there on a backpacker type budget? I viewed some accomodation online (no intention to book, more to gauge the prices), and it seemed more expensive than what both other travellers and Reddit have proclaimed. Therefore, any and all tips and tricks to stretch our money in Argentina would be greatly appreciated. Cheers",Stretching the Argentinean dollar,,Koncaveat,,0,2022-12-12 11:01:57
backpacking,any safe and cheap suggestions? I’ve been wanting to feel “enlightened” or whatever but do not want to splurge on a week long trip. Don’t mind staying in a hostel as long as it’s somewhere that is not very expensive or dangerous for 1-3 female travelers. Also don’t mind if it’s very cold during this time of year.

backpacking,"Hey everyone. 

I am planning a 7-week itinerary for early July to late August 2023 - myself and a friend (both male &amp; 20's - love the outdoors, beach and a drink). I am aware some of the countries have rainy season - wondering what your thoughts were on the timings/route etc, and any improvements. 

**Nights 1-4 - Bangkok** 

* I travelled Thailand for 10 months recently. Saw the country in depth, so returning more through convenience and to have a little slice of nostalgia before heading to the untravelled. 

**Nights 5-7 - Luang Prabang**

* We all be using the new Chinese railway for convenience purposes!
* Will the Khuang Si waterfall be even visitable at this time?

**Nights 8-10 - Vang Vieng**

**Nights 11 - Vientiane**

* Read mixed reviews online, but gravitating towards only one nights before heading on. 

**Nights 12-13 Kuala Lumpur** 

* I am not completely fixated on Malaysia here, however it just seems to make sense geographically and cost wise. 
* I would love to get to Penang for a day or two, however I don't think it's worth the journey for such a short time there.

**Nights 14-45 - Bali** 

* I include Bali and surrounding islands in this. 
* The plan is to take it relatively slow and no massive plan. Perhaps 5/6 different places for 6/5 days.

**Nights 46-48 - Singapore**

* Is this a good amount of time?

The biggest problem I've found is that everything that people recommend is generally, utterly uncool. I'm curious if there are any streetwear enthusiasts that can recommend some good complete wardrobes for 2 months in SEA (mid-March - mid-May), or at the very least some essential items, tops, bottoms, socks, shoes, sandals, bags, accessories, etc.


I know some people are going to think/say that no one cares what you look like as long as you're comfy yada yada, I don't care for this opinion.


Shoes wise so far I've found these that may fit some of the criteria people have given:

I was inspired by a post on r/Ultralight to try and create a relatively lightweight packing list that can serve for someone who is doing both wilderness and travel style backpacking. This is the result of a solid 10-12 minutes of frantic googling.

My base requirements were to be able to survive a week or so in the woods and also to carry enough clothes to feel like a civilized human in a hostel. I set my limit for camping at weather below freezing (because that's hard), and accepted the fact that no club or reasonably nice bar would let me in the door (because carrying nice shoes would really kill my vibe). Also I never travel with a camera or laptop, so if you do I'm sorry but I left you out.

I used either items I already own or information taken primarily from REI. I initially wanted to make the list budget friendly, but frankly that was too much work.

My friend and I are taking a year off before uni and are planning a month and a half long trip to Peru.

That being said we are very interested in spending our time backpacking thru the beautiful Andes.

Does anyone know of services available that send out guides with you or offer structure for budding backpackers?

What are some must have gear items we should acquire before setting off on our adventure?

Will it be too rainy to camp out (late January thru early March)? Would it be better to try and stay in hostels along the way? Is that even an option…

As far as I can tell, these are the differences.

The Aether has a rigid back panel (along with a higher weight rating), heat moldable shoulder and hip straps, compression straps across the ""shove-it"" pouch, and a large zip that goes across the entire pack, to access anything without having to go through the traditional drawstring opening on the top.

The Atmos has the non-rigid mesh (Antigravity) packpanel (I've had problems with items poking me in the back because of this), shoulder straps and hip belt, trekking pole attachments on the shoulder strap, and a large side zip on each side to access the interior of the pack, instead of the Aether's full zip.  The Atmos also has a dual front zipper pouch that isn't mentioned on the product manual for some reason.

Aside from those few differences, they're literally the same pack.

Oddly enough the Aether has ""more features"", but a lower price.  I'm not sure what that's about.

backpacking,"Hey I just bought my first tent and I’m super stoked, it’s the co-op passage 2. I’ve been doing some research on the gear I need, and I’m looking at getting a self inflating sleeping pad and probably some sort of sleeping bag.

I’ll be doing a lot of my camping in the North Florida/Georgia region where the nights can probably range from 70 degrees to in the lower 30s. If I got a sleeping pad like the sea to summit with an r value of 4.2, would that make me really hot if the nighttime temp was say 68? Or would it only stop me from getting really cold but not make me sweat? I was also looking at the Thermarest one which has an r value of 3.1. 

For sleeping bags, if I get a bag rated to 30 degrees like the trailbreak 30, could I use it as a blanket in 60-70 degree nights or would I be too hot? I know I could buy a lightweight quilt but if it’s not necessary, I’m trying to keep the budget down. I would like to future proof my gear because I plan on possibly doing some 3 season trips in other places. Any recommendations or advice?

Thanks",Best bang for my buck for 3 season gear?,,peaceofmine101,,0,2022-12-08 16:08:42

Conservation of habitat is a key component of preserving tiger populations, as well as their prey base, by setting up protected areas. Why are tiger reserves so important? They come from tigers, but why are they so important?

Tigers are respected in Indian culture. Since ancient times, it has symbolized grandeur, power, beauty, and fury. In the past few decades, it has become a symbol of courage and strength for us. In Hindu mythology, the tiger is also the vehicle of Goddess Durga.

Tigers would have been the topic if you talked about Sariska National Park. Could it be possible? It is known for its Royal Bengal Tigers that live in Sariska Tiger Reserve. It is not only home to tigers, but also to a perfect blend of nature.

It is the soul of Alwar district because of its flora and fauna. About 881 square kilometers make up the central part of the Aravalli Hills. Grasslands and rocky hills are found here along with scrub dry forests and dry deciduous forests.

backpacking,"I want to travel across the world when I graduate, but I can only survive on a tight budget. My plan is to save up between $10k-$15k, backpack across the state I live in to get the feel of it first, and then branch out from there as I cover more ground and experience. The only real experience I have so far is walking around the county with my friend a few times a month.

I'm 17 years old and beginning to save up money for my tavels soon, and I wanted to hear some advice from people who have experience in hiking, backpacking, or travelling in general before I graduate school.

Here's what I'm specifically curious about:
- How do manage finding places to sleep?
- How can I make small cash on the road?
- Should I establish a place to live? Or will I be fine nomad-ing around?
- What kind of places should I avoid?
- What kind of self defense/emergency items should I have? (I already have two pocket knives, and I plan to buy a taser when I can legally own one)
- Is it safe enough for me to travel alone?
- how do I manage bathroom needs and showers?
- How should I deal with any unexpected weather changes/emergencies?

My parents have kept me inside for most of my life, so I don't really have much experience travelling *anywhere* besides the few walks I go on with my friend. I'd say I'm pretty ignorant to the outside world, which is partially why I want to go out and travel. I just want to have fun and experience the world in it's rawest form while I'm still young.

You may fall into a heavy snowfall. Quite often there is foggy weather, which can spoil visibility. On such days, it is better to refuse skiing.

Hi backpackers. I’m going on an extended backpacking trip next year around south and south east Asia. I have a pretty awkward contact lens prescription. I had assumed I’d have to carry around 9 months worth of my prescription for daily contacts (I don’t want to be bothered with cleaning and maintenance for 2 weekly or monthly contacts while travelling)
If I’m just spending a few days in a few or the big cities like bangkok, Hanoi, Chang Mai , cebu , yogyakarta.. does anyone know if it’d be possible to pick up contacts along the way? 
At home, it usually takes the opticians over a week to order in my custom shortsighted , high myopia , astigmatism prescription contacts . 
If it would be wiser to just bring ALOT of contacts with me .. I can do that .. but it would be great to avoid needing to.
Any advice very appreciated",Shortsighted backpackers! Advice please!,,Chopinpioneer,,0,2022-12-05 22:16:00

&amp;#x200B;

This is my 2022/2023 winter camping kit. It is intended to maximize comfort and preparedness for 72 hours, although I could survive longer if needed out of this bag/setup. I am in no way trying to be lightweight, ultralight, or shed weight at the moment. If you didn't know, the White Mountain National Forest has the most severe weather in the world. On Mount Washington weather observatory at 1:21 pm on April 12, 1934, the extreme value of **231 mph** out of the southeast was recorded. This would prove to be the highest natural surface wind velocity ever officially recorded by means of an anemometer, anywhere in the world. This record would be held until 1996 when a wind speed of **253 mph** was recorded on Barrow Island, Australia. The notoriously unpredictable weather in the WMNF region is due to three seperate weather systems all converging at the summit of Mt. Washington. On January 16, 2004, the summit weather observation registered a temperature of **−43.6 °F** and sustained winds of 87.5 mph, resulting in a wind chill value of **−102.59 °F** on the mountain. The lowest temperature I have experienced while camping in this area is **-30ºF**. Certain items in the kit (such as the battery pack) are only functionable if kept warm (with body heat, an insulated case, a fire, etc.) especially the Isobutane stove. Having redundancy in your winter kit is essential, like being able to throw your stove on a fire and cook that way. A great option is also SKILLS. Learning things like bushcraft, thru-hiking, primitive survival techniques, is such a good way of cutting down on weight and needing less items. Overall, the more you know, the less you need. I built this kit with the idea of ease and comfort being the main aspects of my trips. After spending some years in the Marines, I have fulfilled my desire to be miserable in the outdoors. Being able to ruck in my pack to an area far off trail, on a mountain, in the wilderness, and then set up camp mindlessly. All while being warm, comfortable, relaxed, and ready for anything. 

If you have any questions, recommendations, or comments on any of my gear; let me know! Leave a reply or a DM, I love all you outdoors folk. See you out there!","My extreme cold weather kit - WMNF, Northeast US.",,SunshineRJH,,0,2022-12-05 20:40:00

Indonesia: Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Malang, Mount Bromo, Kawah Ijen, Canggu, Ubud, Gili T, Gili Air, Lombok, Panida Islands

Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh, Dalat, Hoi An, Da Nang, Hue, Phong Nha, Ninh Binh, Ha Giang, Sapa, Cat Ba, Hanoi

Thailand: Bangkok, Chaing Mai, Chaing Rai, Pai, Krabi, Ko Phi Phi, Khoa Sok, Phang Nga, Ko Pha Ngan, Ko Tao

Cambodia: Phnom Penh, Seim Reap, Koh Rong, Koh Rong Samloem

My favourite destinations were the Ha Giang Loop in Vietnam, Siem Reap in Cambodia, and Vang Viang in Laos. With that said, each country had something beautiful and amazing to offer.

Indonesia had the worst food out of all the countries mentioned above, Vietnamese and Thai were elite.

The weather was perfect (Quite lucky), and it did not rain too much but when it did it was quick

Overall, I spent around 4 months travelling and spent £3500 which is around the budget I had. I also did all the activities/tours I wanted to do.

As a solo traveller, it was super easy to find people and travel with them. Most people are solo travellers so if you are dreading whether you should go then don't. The days that I was on my own were a few days where I wanted to disconnect and just be on my own.

I think the important question is whether I would do it all over again. and simply put HELL YES!!

At present, Guo Wengui, who is involved in multiple lawsuits and is suspected of fraudulent loans and foreign exchange fraud, has fled overseas for about three years. According to multiple sources, Guo Wengui searched for high-level relations from 2015 to 2016, hoping that someone would help him settle his lawsuit and return to China. And Zhao Lixin and Ge Changzhong also took a fancy to Guo Wengui's mentality of using his power to cling to high-level connections in order to return to China, so they made their debut and pretended to be ""middlemen"" to cheat him of money. Guo Wengui's female secretary in Hong Kong, Qu Guojiao, sent people to Shenzhen to take Ge Changzhong to Hong Kong, and went through the formalities of transferring 20 million yuan to Ge Changzhong.

We are from The Netherlands and want to be able to reach our destination  by car, not flight. We are thinking (and preparing) to do \~1km-5km hikes  per day with a maximum of 2km altitude change. If any places you know  fit this description please comment and I can start looking for rooms in  that area. We just need a affordable place. My mother and father are  both fluent in German &amp; English and my mother knows basic french too, so we should be able to communicate with a lot of locals.

First countries to come to mind would be Germany or (north) France, both  places we've been to before. They are excellent hiking places and  definitely a good option. We just don't know where to go within that country. Another, tougher option is Norway but then we'd have to take a  ferry and probably be better prepared so I'd postpone that for later. We  could do Poland but none of us know any polish and it would have to be  somewhat near Germany. Then there is Belgium/Luxembourg but those don't  have particularly long trials or Denmark which is mostly flat ground. Lastly, the UK could be an option. Then we'd be preparing for different, less mountainous hikes tough.",Best places to hike in Western Europe?,,Orange_vendetta,,0,2022-11-30 08:50:28

\- My biggest worry for the moment is finding a motorbike to purchase in KL and eventually sell in Bangkok when I have to leave. Does anyone have any advice for such a maneuver? 

\- Is night life in Mayalasia + Thailand (especially Phuket, Chang-Mai, Bangkok) as a spoken-for-man worth pursuing, or should I hunker down in the backpackers for the night and save my strength pursuing day activities?

\-What are the must-see vistas, monuments and general attractions I should take on my route? So far, it seems I'm going KL -&gt; Mallaca -&gt; Pengang -&gt; Langkawi -&gt; Then I head to Thailand \~12th of December.

My partner and I are planning a 4 week trip throughout Thailand in February, and are desperate to hear some advice, tips, and suggestions of places to stay and eat at. 

Here is our rough itinerary, we are keeping all dates open and flexible to stay/leave places as we would like. 

Fly into Bangkok, wanting to stay on/near Koh San Road for 2-3 nights

Over to Pattaya, (yes, we know its a sleezy place we have read so many posts of people shitting on the city, but we are young and frankly cant wait to experience it) for 2-3 nights

Down to Koh Chang for a bit, then back to Bangkok to catch a flight to Krabi

And then island hopping the southern islands near Krabi: Koh Samui, Koh Phi Phi, Phuket, Koh Lanta

End back in Bangkok for a couple nights in Chinatown then flying home

We are totally aware we probably wont see all these places, but that's kind of the idea of what we want to do. We are trying to keep our budget as low as possible, 1000-1500 CAD/each after roundtrip flights.

I'm currently choosing my new backpack that I will be using for 2 weeks/1month trips in next months. I want to be carry on/a bit bigger size. I have a nice discount from work for Osprey (30% on every backpack) and now I need to select between:

1. Farpoint 40l (2022) model - I like it because I have an option to select my daily back on my own, but from the other side I will still need to choose something and carry with me.
2. Porter 46l (2022) model - this will give me as a newbie of packaging a bit of comfort with size. Still daily little 6-10l bag or something else will be needed.
3. New Farpoint 55l (2022) model with daily bag - I heard that this is an improved version, which fits now after detaching the bag as a carry on and you have small bag with you as a personal item. I really into this, but from the opposite size it seems a bit big. Some people say that I will not have access to valuables but the main compartment is lockable so I don't see a problem with that.

From the above, the third one seems to me as a winner. But maybe after hearing your stories I will change me mind.

Can you please advise me what is a good choice in this situation? Also, what is your daily bag when travelling and you leave your main bag at a hostel (male travellers especially!).

She set out on a relatively nice day with only hiking sneakers, some water, exercise pants a little food and a thin shelled jacket.  She would later that day encounter single digit temps, waist deep snow and gale force winds and ultimately succumbed to the conditions after loosing the trail.
 I cant help but just imagine the sheer terror and helplessness this poor girl must have felt as she lay there dying and i just wanted to make a post reminding all you novice hikers and even the hardcore pro's that sometimes the extra weight is worth it to ensure you have all of the correct gear and the things you may need to save your life. Its also incredibly important to know when to turn around and to know that its okay to turn around if you feel as though you are pushing your limits. Summit fever is very real and brings a lot of people to the cusp of their abilities and it is so incredibly important to be able to say ""ok this is getting to be too much, i better head back and try again another day"" .
 there are very few things more dangerous in the mountains to yourself than your own ego and i just wanted to remind you all to be safe, be mindful and be thankful to live another day to see another summit because for this poor soul this one was her last.

backpacking,"I'm planning a long distance walk across Europe from The Netherlands to Romania. I'm planning it roughly for April-October which should give me plenty of time to walk and sightsee. I've dotted a very rough map of my potential journey below. 


The problem that I've just realised is that I can only spend 90 days in the Schengen area every 6 month period. 
This would mean I would need to get to Serbia by the 90 day mark, which makes things a lot harder and more strict as to how much time I spend in each place. 

I know there are visas that I can get, but they're by individual country and a bit unclear, for example if I got an extended visa for the largest country I'd go through, Germany, how would Hungary know that I hadn't spent my Schengen days traveling through Germany? They don't stamp your passport so nobody would be able to know right? 


I have an idea but I don't know if it would work:
If I go on a brief holiday to the Schengen area in January, by the time I am midway through my April-Oct trek, roughly Juneish, the 180 period would've reset as technically my 180 day period would've started in Jan, not April. 
I have a fishy feeling this won't work and I'm missing something, but am keen to hear what you think?


My alternative will simply be to take transport if I don't make it to Serbia in 90 days, which is very doable but I'd prefer to walk most of it.",How do I backpack through Europe (Schengen) for longer than 90 days.,,Kaizerdave,,1,2022-11-24 01:58:42

backpacking," I'm considering a 2023 AT NOBO, and I just did my first ""long"" trip this weekend. (\~30 miles in 2 days, 1 night, avg pace of 2.8mph). I felt great for the majority of the trip, but in the last couple of miles, I started getting some pretty bad pain in my left leg just below the back of my knee/popliteal region. It hurts mostly on extension of the knee joint at the beginning/end of my stride. It got a little better overnight, but still definitely hurts. For reference, I'm M25, \~130lbs, 5'8"", relatively active lifestyle.

I'm a little concerned, because this trip was meant to be a test to see if my body could handle the double-digit-mile days of the AT. It was also meant to be a test to see if I'd do a longer trail this weekend (Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail, 70miles). Now I'm not sure if I should do that trip, especially since it would be hard to get off the trail and back home without hitchhiking on the state highways.

It might also be relevant to mention that the trail I did was more of a bike trail (built over decommissioned railroad tracks), and was mostly flat with hard gravel/pavement surfaces.

Is this type of pain normal? Will it go away with time/continued training/exertion?",How common is leg pain after the first couple days on a long-distance trail? And does it normally go away?,,apersello34,,0,2022-11-21 17:52:11

my one concern is—i'm an asian-identifying woman in early 20s, and i'm very unfamiliar with spanish at the moment (aggresively learning through duolingo every day though!). many of the posts regarding safety/security i've seen on this thread, especially for latin/south america, is to ""not draw attention"" or to just try and ""blend in"" with the locals

however, i feel like i would stick out regardless in my case, aside from being aware of the standard precautions. i'm wondering if anyone else with my background has backpacked across similar regions and have any experiences they can share, or any tips i can learn from? 

i'm just hoping to hear a little on what to expect in my position. specifically- what i can do to mitigate any potential risks, and how can i best immerse myself in local culture as an outsider!

backpacking,"So my father and I are currently in Vietnam on a UK passport. Prior to entering and during our trip I have read lots of different information regarding Visas and extensions, border runs etc. 

Here is my experience.

So before arrival I had purchased a 30 day e visa from the official government website and printed this out.  (90 day visa are not available). 

We flew from Bangkok to Hanoi. At the airport in Bangkok the check in desk didn't ask to see proof of visa and I was told we would be permited 15 days as standard. Upon arrival into Hanoi immigration didn't ask for my visa yet stamped our passports for 30 days. Maybe they could see on their system we had purchased an e visa?

We rented motorbikes and during our 30 day road trip we attempted to cross the land border into Laos and Cambodia (leaving the motorbikes behind at a cafe near the gate). Both borders turned us away and instructed us to purchase an E visa before arriving. This contradicts the information on the official Laos and Cambodia websites but non the less we couldn't purchase visa on arrival.

We opted not to fly out and leave the motorbikes unattended but I'm sure a flight out and back would have been okay. However this option seemed silly when the fine for overstaying was considerably less than the cost of the cheapest return flight.

We contacted our motorbike rental company who knew a 'guy' that would be able to extend our visa by another 30 days for $50 each. However this required sending our passport by post and would take 1-2 weeks to get them back. Risky business. 

Anyway the saga continues. 

We arrived in NHA Trang on 5th November (where we return the motorbikes). Our visa expired on 8th November and we were planning on flying to Bangkok from the airport here in NHA Trang. 

Then... My father gets hit hard with fever like symptoms. He progressively gets worse and cannot walk, eat and struggled to drink any fluids. Concerned for his health I took him to the hospital where they did all tests and confirmed it was Dengue fever. After a night in hospital and a trip to the specialist we returned to the hotel. 

He is making a steady recovery and building up his strength again. He should be fit to fly in the next week. 

I spoke with immigration to explain the situation (at this time we were 6 days over our visa) and was treated like a criminal. They told me it would take 15 days to process the overstayed visa. I was reluctant to hand over my passport due to countless reviews stating that they are scammers, fraudsters and criminals. In many cases holding onto your passport for months. It goes without saying this isn't a great outcome. 

I contacted the embassy in the UK and in Vietnam who both said they cannot help.

I spoke with Hanoi and HCM immigration but they cannot do anything for me unless I'm there physically and even then the 2 week admin timeframe still applies.

I went to the airport and they were most unhelpful and demanded my passport. Long story short they couldn't help me either. 

Having exhausted all other options I can think of I will return to the immigration office here in NHA Trang tomorrow and then I will be in their hands. Fate will decide our outcome and how long we are effectively held prisoner in Vietnam. 

Sorry for the long-winded story but I believe this post would have been helpful for me to read before arriving in Vietnam so hopefully this can clear up some questions you all may have. 

The general feeling I get is that the rules and regulations surrounding Visas in Vietnam are currently blurred and two different government officials can have two very different answers to your question. 

Other than this Vietnam has been epic! I might as well make myself comfortable because it looks like I won't be leaving anytime soon.

The wide version is unavailable in my country so I've got no real chance to try it on IRL, only order it online... But idk if ordering ""blindly"" like that is the best option for my tricky feet tbh

And yes, I know I can order them and return it back if they don't fit, which would've been great... Except my country has quite the heavy custom tax on items above  a certain price range (which these shoes easily exceed) so I'd still waste quite a bit of money for nothing if I do that.

backpacking,"Hi, guys! I absolutely love traveling and thanks to my vast experience I've realized that even the most expensive and qualitative bags won't serve you as long as you want if you don't take proper care of your suitcase. That's why I've decided to share my knowledge with fellow travelers, and I hope my tips help you keep your favorite bag in service for a longer time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, in large part, it all depends on the product materials. If one wet cloth is enough to care for plastic bags, in the case of nylon, it will be extremely insufficient since even the slightest stain on the surface will be very difficult to remove. In this situation, you'll have to resort to special cleaning products.

&amp;#x200B;

My favorite material for any kind of bag is leather. Therefore, I've used this voyager carry-on bag [https://vonbaer.com/products/voyager-leather-carry-on-bag-with-wheels](https://vonbaer.com/products/voyager-leather-carry-on-bag-with-wheels) for my last four trips. Leather bags should be cared for the same way as other leather accessories, using special means with a safe composition for the surface.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't recommend fabric suitcases since they are more difficult to care of. They are mainly made of nylon, vinyl, polyester, and other fabrics. You need to clean these regularly, using a damp cloth soaked in warm water and soap. After washing, you should gently wipe the accessory with a dry and clean cloth. If you have any stains that you can't remove, you should resort to special foam products.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally - plastic, polycarbonate, and ABS suitcases. It's easiest to take care of these products since an ordinary wet rag will be enough to clean the surface from light dirt. For more persistent stains, use foam products. However, don't apply solvents or abrasives since they can severely damage the surface of the suitcase, after which it will be impossible to restore it.

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, when cleaning big stains, regardless of the type of material, you need to rub the item with circular movements, starting with the surface of the suitcase from the center of the stain. Thus, there will be no streaks on the front side.",Tips on prolonging the service life of our indispensable travel bags.,,VoidBolster737,,0,2022-11-15 23:28:21

backpacking,"El lemurpir es una subespecie domesticada derivada del lémur cola de anillo, la comparación de estas dos especies se diferencia porque el lemurpir tiene una trompa similar a la de un tapir de la península Yucatán. Habita en el continente africano específicamente en el Congo desde 1917 que se tiene registro de su avistamiento por primera vez.

En Europa el lemurpir fue muy popular como mascota a finales de los 1970 por los colonizadores del continente africano que regresaban a sus países de origen. Y aunque era confundido con un lemur cola de anillo por la complexión de su cuerpo, siempre fue su trompa lo que llamaba la atención de algunos investigadores interesados en animales que provenían de diferentes partes del mundo.

Fue para principios del año 2000 que un grupo de científicos e investigadores se aventuraron a regiones de África en busca del hábitat del lemurpir con apenas escasa información de la especie, la más relevante de un investigador explorador hindú que describió a un animal con cuerpo de mono araña y trompa de oso hormiguero en el país del Congo. El grupo estuvo en diferentes regiones de África en su búsqueda hasta que al llegar al Congo entendieron porque el lemurpir vive exclusivamente ahí.

El ecosistema del lemurpir posee características climáticas y de alimentos para esta especie y la demás fauna de esa región;

* El calor es de tipo húmedo día y noche.
* llueve casi todo el año.
* el suelo permanece muy lodoso por la humedad y lluvia
* El área es abundante en cacao, principal alimento del lemurpir.
* Las hojas de árboles muy específicos también forman parte de su alimentación.

A diferencia de las demás especies de lémur que pueden alimentarse de algunos insectos y algunos carnívoros de pequeñas especies, el lemurpir es únicamente herbívoro.También son muy sedentarios si los comparamos con los demás ya que cuando escalan un árbol para comer lo hacen con demasiada dificultad y pueden permanecer meses en un mismo árbol hasta acabarse el cacao o las hojas.

Su convivencia con los demás animales con los que comparte un mismo ecosistema es muy tranquila ya que todos son herbívoros, por lo que nadie se alimenta de otro animal.Ya que suelen ser muy sedentarios su vida es muy prolongada,  llegando casi a los 25-30 años desde su nacimiento.

Al ser el lemurpir un animal endémico del Congo ha surgido la idea de reproducirlo en otras partes del mundo con el fin de domesticarlo y conservar la especie, esto ha traído como consecuencia una extracción masiva de lemurpires por lo que la ONU en conjunto con el World Wide Fund Nature (WWF) lo ha declarado como una especie protegida.

En mi viaje a África hace 3 meses vi a este animal en algunas casas y los habitantes lo llevaban consigo en los hombros,  algunos cobran por una foto con ellos. Claro que su cabeza de inmediato me llamó la atención y pregunté de dónde salió esa especie que jamás había visto, fue ahí donde me afirmaron que sólo vive y se reproduce en el Congo por su tipo de ecosistema.",El Lémurpir; un animal que solo habita en el Congo (todo el texto es ficticio y forma parte de un ejercicio de creatividad),,No_Fix_9663,,0,2022-11-15 16:34:15

I want to solo backpack Japan but my main concern is that it doesn’t seem to be a backpacking haven like Thailand or Vietnam, and therefore it might not be easy to meet other travellers even if I go to hostels and try to be social.

It's probably gonna be a minimum of 4 months but I'm buying a one way ticket and plan to leave the option for more open.

backpacking,"**Background/Context:** 

I have a car camping tent that's maybe 6 lbs with the footprint and want to get a backpacking tent.  

Most the time, I'll be doing 2-4 days hikes a handful of times a year.  As my son gets older, we may do Philmont at some point but that would be 2-3 years away.  IOW, I'm not through-hiking the AT, JMT, or PCT.  I live in Virginia so most my hikes are in this area (e.g. Shenandoah National Park).  On the coldest winter days, I plan to be skiing, so I only really need 3 seasons.   

I'm not insane about being an ultra-light backpacker, but also realize that a few ounces here and a few ounces there can easily add up to a few pounds. 

I'm at a point in my life where I don't need to pinch pennies, but I also road bike, mountain bike, ski, and SUP - and I want to keep my wife from divorcing me.   

REI has a coupon where you can take 20% off any regularly priced item - so this seems like a good time to buy (If I choose the Big Agnes below)

**Where I would appreciate your advice:**

The first decision point is whether I do a trekking pole tent or a traditional tent.  Both have their pros and cons - I don't have super strong feelings (so far).   

I could see myself forgetting my trekking poles for a car camping trip.  If a trekking pole broke on a backpacking trip, it could make pitching the tent more difficult.  And if I ever wanted to set up a base camp and spend a day venturing, I would have to collapse the tent.  These are not major things -but considerations.   And it looks like price per pound for my price range, the Big Agnes Tiger Wall actually weighs less than the trekking pole tent.   

For a trekking pole tent, the Durston X-Mid 2 looks especially good.  I'm not at a point where I want to pay an additional $300 to shave 1 pound (so the X-Mid 2 pro is not a consideration).   

Another option is the Lanshan 2 (sold under both Mier and 3FulGear).  It's only $160 but looks like a competent tent.     


For a traditional tent, I was thinking the Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL2 would be a good choice.  With the REI sale, it would be $80 more than the Durston X-Mid 2.   This tent is (oddly) lighter, 3 inches lower inside, 5 sq feet larger inside, etc.  Seems like a great tent.   

Would love to learn from more experienced backpackers what you think.

backpacking,"Hello,

I am planning to travel around SE Asia from December ‘22 to March ‘23.

My itinerary plan is 3/3.5 weeks in Thailand, 7-10 days in Cambodia, 3/3.5 weeks in Philippines in January and 4 weeks in Vietnam in February. I will visit Singapore as well but it will be only for a few days as my flights from and to Asia is by Singapore.

I have been in Thailand in the past for 2 months and seen most parts of it except the mountains and national parks in the country, so that’s what I will try to visit this time. I loved it so much last time that I may spend a week in islands or Chiang Mai as well. Is there anywhere in Thailand that I should definitely not miss it? Which national parks are best to go? Anywhere I should avoid?

Philippines will be completely new for me, I have no idea what I will do, was planning to wing it and get lost in islands so any recommendations about it would be very appreciated.

I also haven’t been in Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore. I will obviously see Angkor Wat in Cambodia and gardens in Singapore even though very touristy, what else I should definitely add to my journey? If I keep Cambodia for 7 days, would it be enough to see around?I think for Vietnam I have a rough idea of places that I want to visit but I will be glad to hear about it too.

I will buy Philippines return tickets in advance, I heard they are asking for onward ticket during entry and the flight tickets are increasing. Will buy Vietnam return tickets in advance too as I will be applying for a visa to stay up to 30 days. Is there any risks to purchasing the flight tickets before applying for their Visa?

I couldn’t decide whether to start from Cambodia or Thailand, as it all depends on where I want to spend the New Year’s Eve. I know that I would be able to enjoy the day in Thailand as there are so many things happening all around the country but how about in Cambodia? Has anyone been in there for New Year’s Eve before?

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Timeline now has to change completely as flights have been causing sooo much problem to me. I am now planning December in Philippines until 29th Dec or so and fly out to Thailand to continue other countries.At the moment my international flight to Singapore is cancelled and they are looking into KUL flights for me to replace as there is no availability for Singapore flights.I have Singapore - Philippines already booked which may be burned if above is not fixed.Then Philippines Airasia charged me 3 times for my onward ticket out from Philippines but they are stating charges got declined and flight is therefore cancelled so no onward flight and I am disputing the charges with my credit card. Seems like going into places and buying tickets on the spot is the only option to guarantee transfers for Philippines. Airlines websites/apps are completely dysfunctional too. So annoying 😖  
I think adding in Philippines have complicated the process so much as I can’t find any other way than flights and Xmas flights are expensive and I have to get out of there within 30 days to not overstay my visa-free time period :/

I will try to be in Thailand for New Year’s Eve because I don’t prefer fireworks, parties and crowded walks for light-shows in cities etc but would love to see lanterns floating all around and chill around beaches.

Thank you for all the replies.","3 months SE Asia Trip, need recommendations please",,Rozii7,,0,2022-11-12 02:22:27

backpacking," Hi,

I am sorry that the cult has been a bit dead recently. It’s just because I’ve just been busy and have not had any time to write. I am in the final year of my PhD so time is hard to come by. 📷

But that doesn’t mean that I haven’t been brainstorming my butt off lol

Maybe you all can give some feedback on some topics I plan to write about when I get the time:

1.) My Apocalypse Predictions  
2.) My Desire to Address My Students with Love  
3.) My Story of Coping with My Breakup (After 10 years of devoted monogamy)  
4.) Most Women are Masturbating Incorrectly  
5.) How is happy place meditation like VR and how to build a place in your mind  
6.) All the roles that this cult could play. (a support group, a family, colleagues)  
7.) Ways to combat anger issues with movement, internal shouting, and aggressive pleasure

Which of these sound most interesting to you? Let me know and I will figure out when I can sit down and really post something awesome!

I believe in you!

I've been getting more into backpacking lately, but as an acid reflux sufferer and side sleeper, am struggling to find a backpacking pillow with enough ""lift"" to feel comfortable enough to fall asleep.

I know that part of ""roughing it"" is being uncomfortable, but this is my hill to die on.

backpacking,"""There's no sense in going further - it's the edge of cultivation,""
            So they said, and I believed it - broke my land and sowed my crop-
            Built my barns and strung my fences in the little border station 
            Tucked away below the foot hills where the trails run out and stop.
            
            Till a voice, as bad as Conscience, rang interminable changes
            On one everlasting Whisper day and night repeated -- so:
           ""Something hidden.  Go and find it.  Go and look behind the Ranges --
           ""Something lost behind the Ranges.  Lost and waiting for you.  Go!""
            
            So I went, worn out of patience; never told my nearest neighbours --
            Stole away with pack and ponies -- left'em drinking in the town; 
            And the faith that moveth mountains didn't seem to help my labours
            As I faced the sheer main-ranges, whipping up and leading down.
            
            March by march I puzzled through'em, turning flanks and dodging shoulders,
            Hurried on in hope of water, headed back for lack of grass;
            Till I camped above the tree-line -- drifted snow and naked boulders --
            Felt free air astir to windward -- knew I'd stumbled on the Pass.
            'Thought to name it for the finder: but that night the Norther found me --
            Froze and killed the plains-bred ponies; so I called the camp Despair
            (It's the Railway Camp to-day, though).  Then my Whisper waked to hound me: --
            ""Something lost behind the Ranges.  Over yonder!  Go you there!""
            
            Then I knew, the while I doubted -- knew His Hand was certain o'er me.
            Still -- it might be self-delusion -- scores of  better men had died --
            I could reach the townsip living, but... He knows what terrors tore me.
            But I didn't... but I didn't.  I went down the other side.
            
            Till the snow ran out in flowers, and the flowers turned to aloes,
            And the aloes sprung to thickets and a brimming stream ran by;
            But the thickets dwined to thorn-scrub, and the water drained to shallows,
            And I dropped again on desert -- blasted earth, and blasting sky....
            
            I remember lighting fires; I remember sitting by them;
            I remember seeing faces, hearing voices through the smoke;
            I remember they were fancy -- for I threw a stone to try 'em.
            ""Something lost behind the Ranges"" was the only word they spoke.
            
            I remember going crazy.  I remember that I knew it
            When I heard myself hallooing to the funny folk I saw.
            Very full of dreams that desert: but my two legs took me through it...
            And I used to watch'em moving with the toes all black and raw.
            
            But at last the country altered -- White Man's country past disputing --
            Rolling grass and open timber, with a hint of hills behind --
            There I found me food and water, and I lay a week recruiting,
            Got my strength and lost my nightmares.  Then I entered on my find.
            
            Thence I ran my first rough survey -- chose my trees and blazed and ringed'em --
            Week by week I pried and sampled -- week by week my findings  grew.
            Saul he went to look for donkeys, and by God he found a kingdom!
            But by God, who sent His Whisper, I had struck the worth of two!
            
            Up along the hostile mountains, where the hair-poised snowslide shivers --
            Down and through the big fat marshes that the virgin ore-bed stains,
            Till I heard the mile-wide mutterings of unimagined rivers,
            And beyond the nameless timber saw illimitable plains!
            
            Plotted sites of future cities, traced the easy grades between'em;
            Watched unharnessed rapids wasting fifty thousand head an hour;
            Counted leagues of water-frontage through the axe-ripe woods that screen 'em --
            Saw the plant to feed a people -- up and waiting for the power!
            
            Well I know who'll take the credit - all the clever chaps that followed --
            Came, a dozen men together -- never knew my desert fears;
            Tracked me by the camps I'd quitted, used the water-holes I'd hollowed.
            They'll go back and do the talking.  They'll be called the Pioneers!
            
            They will find my sites of townships -- not the cities that I set there.
            They will rediscover rivers -- not my rivers heard at night.
            By my own old marks and bearings they will show me how to get there,
            By the lonely cairns I builded they will guide my feet aright.
            Have I named one single river?  Have I claimed one single acre?
            Have I kept one single nugget -- (barring samples)?  No, not I!
            Because my price was paid me ten times over by my Maker.
            But you wouldn't understand it.  You go up and occupy.
            
            Ores you'll find there; wood and cattle; water-transit sure and steady
            (That should keep the railway rates down), coal and iron at your doors.
            God took care to hide the country till He judged His people ready,
            Then He chose me for His Whisper, and I've found it, and it's yours!
            
            Yes, your ""Never-never country"" -- yes, your edge of cultivation""
            And ""no sense in going further"" -- till I crossed the range to see.
            God forgive me!  No, I didn't.  It's God's present to our nation.
            Anybody might have found it but -- His Whisper came to me!

I´m planning to do the W-trek in Torres del Paine in February. Was wondering in anyone could give me some help with the following questions:

1. What is the most normal way for low-budget backpackers to organise their trekking in Torres del Paine (should I book through a website, sort everything out upon arrival etc.)?
2. Are your trekkings suitable for sociable solo-travelers?
3. How long in advance should I be making my booking?

backpacking,"After much deliberation and reading all sorts of reviews and Reddit posts, I bit the bullet and got a new sleeping bag. I got the [Sierra Designs Women's Backcountry Bed 20](https://sierradesigns.com/womens-backcountry-bed-20/) after owning and faithfully using an REI Women's Joule 23 for close to 10 years. I've become a worse sleeper as I get older, and dedicate more space and weight in my pack than most for sleeping. The Joule started to really compress even with proper storage, and I found myself with ""cold spots"" at night where the sleeping bag was snug against me, and it was just really hard to get comfy.

Just for what it's worth and for folks considering it, the Sierra Designs backcountry bed is amazing. It's got a foot vent and the top is kind of like a blanket - it's the most comfortable and snuggly sleeping bag ever, and I can't believe it's for backpacking. It is a ""zipperless"" sleeping bag which felt super risky to me, but I love it!! It doesn't pack down as small as my REI Joule but still does pretty well in a 10L compression sack. It also doesn't have any bottom insulation - the idea behind this is to save weight and assumes you have a good insulated pad. The REI Joule I think sits around 2lbs 2oz while the Sierra Designs back is 2lbs 7oz, so not a significant weight difference. 

The rest of my sleep setup includes:

* Cocoon cotton mummy liner (12 oz)
* Big Agnes Insulated Q Core (41 oz)
* Nemo Fillo Luxury pillow (12 oz)

So overall, not including tent, I carry about 6-7 lbs of weight just for sleeping gear, but it's worth it to me. I offset this extra weight by carrying a 2lb Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2. :) Anyway... for those like me who find it's worth it to carry some extra weight to get a good night's sleep so as to not feel like hot garbage the whole rest of the trip, I highly recommend this bag!",FWIW - An ode to my new sleeping bag - Sierra Designs Women's Backcountry Bed,,Most_Ad_3765,,0,2022-11-07 23:08:49

What’s a good amount of time to spend in the highlands and what should be my main mode of transport? I’m thinking I’ll rent a car for 3-4 days and just your around out there and possibly camp.

From Scotland I’ll cap off my trip visiting some friends in Dublin for a weekend before I return to London to catch a flight home.

backpacking,"Is there often sex in guided group tours?

I want to be clear that I am not being judge mental in the slightest, because everyone’s choices are what will bring them happiness and I don’t find anything wrong with casual sex at all. 

I myself, however, have never had casual sex. I am a man and have only had sex inside of relationships. I will say that my preference in women that calls for me wanting a girlfriend who doesn’t have casual sex is likely due to a bit of jealousy. I have focuses in my life that make it to where I never got to have the casual sex experience, and because of this, when I am not working, I find that I don’t have the necessary “game” to have casual sex. So I feel inferior when a girl I have feelings for was swayed by another man so much that she had casual sex with him. 

I am currently talking to a girl who I just connected with on instagram, after talking for weeks. 

I looked at her page to see if she had pictures of her dogs (she is very fond of them so I wanted to see them), and found out that she recently went on a guided tour to another country with her best friend, and about 4-6 other girls who appear to have been strangers on the same guided tour, and a tour guide and his friend (male). 

The tour guide seems to be a guy who is famous for something else, so I don’t think he’s employed by a company who monitors what he does or anything. He just has a link on his page for traveling with him for a fee. 

The tour guide’s friend had his arm around the girl who I am talking to, in one of the pictures. 

Again, I’m not judging, but I prefer more of a homebody type of girl just to match who I am. Not necessarily someone who doesn’t travel, but someone who doesn’t have casual sex when she does travel. 

How likely is it that there was sex involved on this trip? 

It’s fine if there was, it just makes me want to stay single for a while longer or maybe pursue casual sex myself if it’s as common as it seems to be. I would really appreciate if you guys can give me an answer to my question, both to soothe my curiosity about it and to help me find what direction I want to take for now with dating. Regardless, I think this girl is very nice. 

Thank you all.",Is there often sex in guided group tours?,,TravelingGuidesTours,,0,2022-11-06 01:36:15

I am planning to travel to southern england, france, belgium, netherlands, germany, and italy and will stay primarily in hostels except when I see family in germany. I am also looking to do a good mix of walking/touring cities and hiking/outdoors stuff. This is what I have so far:

1. Backpack: Primarily what size bag is recommended, 40-50L? I was looking at the osprey fairview bag

Please recommend any other brands or backpacks.

\- Will also be getting packing cubes (eagle creek or eBags) and dry bags for dirty laundry

\- Looking for good collapsable (and fashionable) day packs/bags or fanny packs/cross body bags. Or maybe even a tote bad instead.

2) Clothes: **please recommend any styles/clothing brands you think I should look into**. Not sure if this matters but my body type is tall (5'9) and slim (size 25/0 waist).

\- Thinking of definitely packing 2-3 light dresses, two pairs of leggings, one pair of skinny jeans, a few skirts, basic tops/tanks, 1 cardigan, 1 bathing suit

\- Please recommend any comfortable and good underwear/bras especially

\- Was also recommended merino/SmartWool socks instead of cotton, but any other socks that are good/smell resistant lol

\- Jacket: since it will be warm I'm not sure which jacket to get. I do run on the cooler side so a nice light jacket or sweater would be nice. I was looking at Patagonia: 

3) Shoes: flats, casual sneakers, hiking/trail shoes, shower shoes, anything else?

\- Looking for a pair of nice but comfortable flats

\- Merrell hiking shoes

\- Casual ecco walking shoes

\- Should I add any more shoes like maybe sandals? I plan on bringing shower flip flops too.

\- Any cheaper recommendations would be appreciated

4) Everything else: still looking into all the accessories/toiletries/etc I will need to bring, but this is what I have so far:

\- Travel quick dry towel, small microfiber hand towel, tide pod stick/laundry packets, outlet converter/strip, portable phone charger, mini flash light (key chain), ear plugs/eye mask, foldable water bottle, padlock, apple air tags, air pods, wallet (any recommendations?), toiletries bag with travel size items, pain and pepto medications (i do not take any prescribed stuff), tinted sunscreen, dry shampoo/leave in conditioner, glasses/contact lenses/solution, plastic utensils?, travel umbrella or poncho?, wet wipes/hand sanitizer/tissues, anything else I need for hostels?

\- Accessories: sunglasses, fashionable scarf, sarong/shawl, (non-expensive) jewelry, I'm really into hair accessories so maybe like bandannas/head scarves/flowy scrunchies, makeup

Deuter Pros: 3 mesh pockets instead of one, hidden pocket also on bottom of lid, raincover included, easy access to main compartment, probably more durable material, extendable size (from 60 to 75 liters).

I was planning to finally buy a good quality rucksack to last me for years ahead for use in large backpacking expeditions (such as the West Highland Way in Scotland) and general backpacking and travel around the country. With the retailer that I was buying from, they currently have discounts on both the Osprey Archeon 70 and the Osprey Aether Plus 70, and I wanted to ask if anyone could suggest which one I should go for? As far as I understand there is only a 300g difference between the two and the Archeon looks far more durable in terms of material?

I'm looking for a place to stay for a week or two in a rural area on a beautiful river or lake. The place is natural with a relaxed atmosphere on a larger property with trees or jungle or plants. Ideally the stay is sort of like a hostel or guest house or campus where multiple people stay on the property and can be social but is not a constant party and people are at least sort of mature. It needs wifi and a space I can work for a few hours per day. It would likely be in a less expensive country (bonus if in Latin America - but will travel to the other side of the world if need be) and the stay would be $15-$30 USD per night. My common daily activities would include: taking dips in the lake/river, laying in a hammock, going on short hikes, working a bit, saying things like ""ah isn't this the life?"", sitting and doing absolutely nothing.

Sleeping pad:

I’m a side sleeper and stomach sleeper. I’ve tried the following:

- Klymit Static V (did not like it, after one night it lost air, not very comfortable)

- Exped FlexMat Plus (holy ouch, the large egg carton shape felt like rocks! I ended up sleeping on the ground. Only perk was no risk of a leaky mat)

- Sea to Summit comfort plus self inflating women’s (bulky and heavy, comfy but lost air the first night)

Has anyone tried the Exped ultra 3R or the Big Agnes insulated air core? I’m thinking about trying those next?! 

Any side/stomach sleepers like a non-inflatable pad better?

Backpack:

Recently got fitted at REI and tried on almost every backpack they had. I didn’t find a single one that fit me without some sort of weird rubbing or fit. 

I’m 5’7”, 135 lbs, athletic build. Usually carry 30 - 35 lbs-ish will a full pack (water included). (Appreciate all tips on how to get my weight down- already split up gear/food between my partner and I). 

Back measures between 18” and 18.5”. The least annoying pack I tried on was the Osprey Aura 50 in a size M/L, but it’s heavy at just over 4lbs, and if I’m going to pay $300 for a bag, I’d like it to be lighter. 

I was thinking about biting the bullet and ordering a Gossamer Gear pack- any thoughts/advice?

I currently use a 55L North Face pack but it absolutely kills my hips and lower back with how the frame is shaped. (And I’m prepping to eventually do a thru hike on the AT so I’d like a lighter bag to prep). 

Thanks in advance &amp; happy hiking! 🌞🥾

backpacking,"Hi all,

I'm travelling across South America for 6-7 months and doing the typical gringo trail:

1. Peru 2 months
2. Bolivia 2 weeks
3. Chile &amp; Argentina 2 months
4. Ecuador 2 weeks
5. Colombia 1 month

Peru &amp; Chile will involve multi-day hikes: Santa Cruz, Colca Canyon, Ausangate, &amp; Salkantay in Peru,  and 1 month hitchiking/camping around Patagonia including the W trek.

The camping gear I'm bringing:

* Bishop's Pass -18c/0 F sleeping bag
* Lightweight hiking boots
* 55L North Face Terra backpack
* Trekking poles
* SteriPen UV water filter

I'm planning to rent a tent, sleeping pad, and cookset for each trek in Peru and return it. Then I'll buy what I need in Santiago or Buenos Aires before heading down to Pantagonia, reselling all my camping stuff when I'm done there. I'm hoping that'll give me the best combination between having good quality gear and not carrying too much stuff.

Questions:

1. Is it even worth it to take a sleeping bag or should I just rent one until I get to Patagonia? My sleeping bag is 11L/4lbs and takes up a lot of space in my bag.
2. Is it better to buy the rest of my camping gear in Patagonia or Santiago? Is it all really expensive in both places?
3. How easy will it be to resell what I buy in Patagonia or Santiago? Do the gear rental places in Patagonia buy used gear for a good price?

## Your essential guide to the roof of the world

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1d2azk4mujg91.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a88367beec1ec802c7d26ffa251e813eacd58189

Due to its rich cultural heritage, an abundance of temples, and world-famous mountain peaks and treks, Nepal has become one of the most sought-after destinations for thrill-seekers around the world. If you’ve decided to become one of them and finally decided to book a trip to this exciting part of the world, you might want to check out this essential guide to get you started.

It contains all the essential information for your upcoming Nepal tour, including the best time to go, how to stay safe, as well as all the adrenalin-pumping adventures you can embark on once you touch the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

### Getting a visa

Foreign nationals visiting Nepal can obtain a tourist visa on arrival — multiple entry visas are issued for 15, 30, and 90 days duration for visitors from most countries. The only exceptions are citizens of India, who are not required to have a visa in order to enter the country.

The application for a visa on arrival can be filled out online [before the trip](http://online.nepalimmigration.gov.np/tourist-visa) or at the border. Visa fees should be paid in US Dollars in cash at the border.

&amp;#x200B;

### Getting along with the locals

Nepal is home to a number of different ethnic and religious groups, visitors are advised to observe local etiquette out of respect for the Nepalese people, who are generally friendly to foreigners.

When visiting sacred sites or homes, men are advised to wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers. Women are supposed to cover the knees, shoulders, and chest — so long skirts or loose-fitting trousers can be ideal to wear for these occasions. Moreover, make sure to remove your shoes when entering a temple or someone’s house.

When greeting each other, people tend to avoid physical contact. The right way to say hello is to press your hands in front of your chest and say “namaste” (nam-as-tay). Since Nepal is a fairly conservative country, you are advised not to indulge in public displays of affection with your significant other.

During meals, remember to use your right hand to eat and pass food to other people. The same goes for handling money: the right hand should be used to give and accept notes, while you can use your left hand to hold or support the right elbow as a sign of respect.

&amp;#x200B;

### Health and Safety

Immunizations are not mandatory when visiting Nepal; however, there are still a few vaccines visitors are recommended to get prior to their departure. These include Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and Meningitis, as well as boosters for Tetanus, Polio, Mumps, and Measles.

The Nepalese diet might not be easy on the stomach for every traveler, so make sure to take probiotics to avoid contracting digestive issues, especially if you are trekking at high altitudes. If you are trekking in Nepal, make sure to allow yourself to acclimatize properly so that your body adapts to the environment. You can even buy Diamox pills at the local pharmacy.

Kathmandu, the nation’s capital, is notorious for pollution. Visitors who are planning on staying in the city are advised to protect themselves with anti-pollution masks to avoid developing allergies or respiratory issues. If you find yourself in a health emergency, Kathmandu is equipped with clinics and hospitals.

To give yourself peace of mind, it is always a good idea to purchase travel insurance that can cover you in case of theft, loss of personal belongings, or medical issues.

&amp;#x200B;

### Money matters 

The official Nepalese currency is the Rupee

The official currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). Major cities and towns, including Kathmandu and Pokhara, are equipped with banks and ATMs where you can withdraw cash. ATMs are hard to find in rural areas, so make sure to always carry enough notes on you if you plan on exploring. Make sure to break them up into large banknotes for more efficiency and convenience when paying for services.

To avoid exorbitant prices and potential scams, make sure to book all of your accommodation at fixed rates in advance, where possible. When arranging a ride via taxi or other means of transport, make sure to always agree on the fee before starting the journey. Fees for taxi and rickshaw rides can be rounded up.

When it comes to tipping, the practice is not mandatory, but it will be appreciated, especially if you deem the service satisfactory. The staff will welcome a symbolic tip.  
Trekking guides and porters should be rewarded with a 10% to 15% tip if you are pleased with the service.

Haggling is expected in Nepalese markets, as prices of items are usually marked up. However, when bartering, try not to come across as too arrogant or make rude remarks about the product itself. If you’re interested in purchasing something, allow the seller to still have a decent profit on his or her goods.

&amp;#x200B;

### Food and water

The most common meal in Nepal is called dal bhat. It consists of steamed rice, and lentil soup, accompanied by green veggies and meat. The dish is typically infused with spices like turmeric, coriander, garam masala, and cumin. The meal might come served with Dahi (yogurt) and achar (pickle).

In areas where rice isn’t as abundant, dal (lentil soup) is consumed with dhindo, a thick mixture of grain flour, clarified butter, and hot water. Pro tip: there is a process of enjoying dhindo in the correct way, ask anyone before you eat.

Avoid drinking tap water in Nepal unless it’s been boiled or purified. The same goes for any drinks that contain ice. The quickest way to sanitize water is to simply infuse it with a purifying tablet that is easily available at the local pharmacy.

When out exploring, make sure to always arm yourself with plenty of bottled water, which is readily available in shops and supermarkets.

When contemplating restaurant choices, it’s not always possible to know whether an eatery has a solid reputation. When in doubt as to where to eat, look for places that get a lot of traffic. A higher turnover of customers means the food is likely to be fresh and properly cooked. You can also minimize the risk of stomach bugs by staying away from street food.

Remember that it’s Nepalese custom to eat with your hands, so make sure to clean them with a hand sanitizer before you start devouring your delicious meal.

&amp;#x200B;

### Getting around

Nepal has a developed network of domestic flights, with three major airlines: Nepal Airlines, Buddha Air, and Yeti Airlines. There are also a number of smaller operators, as well as private carriers, whose flight prices tend to get steeper.

The main air travel hub is Kathmandu, while other well-developed airports include Pokhara, Nepalganj, and Biratnagar.

Buses are the most common and least expensive form of transport in the country. Most towns and villages in Nepal can be reached via buses departing from Kathmandu and Pokhara. Buses designed for tourists are more likely to come with added space, good air conditioning, and fewer stops in between two destinations.

As widespread and cheap as buses can be, it is advised to avoid traveling by bus at night. The reason for this is a combination of unsafe mountain roads, lack of infrastructure, and reckless driving, all of which can be a nightmare.

Local buses operate between smaller towns and tickets can be purchased from a conductor while on board. Be advised that these are not recommended for foreigners, as they are less safe and it’s not uncommon for conductors to jack up ticket prices when they spot tourists.

In Kathmandu, there are several means of transport to get from point A to point B, with taxis and rickshaws as the two standard options. Keep in mind that taxi drivers are required to operate a meter, so if you don’t see one, you can decline the ride or arrange the fee beforehand with the driver. If you plan on taking local buses, make sure to always come prepared with smaller notes (5 or 10 rupees).

Taxis are easy to spot across the city, while rickshaws largely operate from the tourist district called Thamel.

### Outdoor adventures

It is no secret that Nepal is a prime destination for trekking. The most popular trek for first-time visitors is the Annapurna Circuit, which stretches for about 230 kilometers across the Annapurna massif in the north-central part of the country. Another popular trekking route is to the famous Everest Base Camp, where you’ll get a chance to see the world’s tallest mountain.

Aside from treks, Nepal is also a haven for adventure sports too! Kayaking and river rafting are some of the most popular outdoor activities for thrill-seeking visitors thanks to the vibrant, winding rivers that riddle the country’s landscape. The most visited rivers for kayakers and rafters include [Bhote Koshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhotekoshi_River), [Sun Koshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunkoshi_River), and [Trishuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishuli_River). They can make for some great day trips!

Both Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara are great starting points for embarking on a mountain bike tour. If you’re looking for a challenge, then you can even mountain bike the Annapurna Circuit or the enchanting Upper Mustang. In Pokhara, indulge yourself with a paragliding experience, which will allow you to witness spectacular views of mirror-like lakes, rice terraces, and dizzying mountain peaks.

&amp;#x200B;

### Staying connected

If you want to avoid roaming charges and getting slapped with an outrageous phone bill when you return home, the smartest option would be to purchase a SIM card upon your arrival in Nepal. Get your SIM card at the airport for a hassle-free process. The two biggest mobile network carriers are NCELL and NTC. You have the option of buying SIM cards that allow making calls and using data, or cards loaded with data only.

### When to visit

Mid-September to November is considered the best time to visit Nepal due to clear skies and pleasant temperatures that are perfect for outdoor exploration — making this the peak tourist season too. Dashain, Nepal’s biggest festival falls in October, and this is celebrated across the country. Plan your trip around this time if you want to experience both nature and traditions.

March to May is characterized by clear, warm weather. Even though this is not peak season for tourists, it is perfect for mountain trekkers as this is when nature comes alive with blossoms. Rhododendrons blossoming in the hills are a spectacular sight!

Nepal is a generally safe and endlessly exciting place to visit for every adventure-hungry traveler. When you finally decide to travel to this enchanting South Asian country, we hope these tips and tricks will help you make the first steps towards a voyage of a lifetime.

backpacking,"Hi everyone (I’m m18), just came back from this incredible trek through the Kyrgyz Tien-Shan mountains. As I’m 18, it’s the first overnight trek I’ve done (3 days) and we climbed an elevation gain of 2400m to the highest point of 3900m at the Ala-Kul Pass that overlooks the lake and glacier. This is the most trekked route in the country but still the route was sometimes empty for hours at a time. 

For anyone who’d like, here’s a description I’ve written.

The only way to describe this Karakol Valley was perfect. The spruce-laden valley sides meet at an idyllic V shape cut by a winding river where young horses jump about on the grassy banks.  It hailed and rained every now and then but the sun that breaks through the clouds illuminating the droplets and the air seemed to glow.  
We stopped at the river bank for lunch before heading up a strenuously steep feeder valley through a dense, moss-coated forest and eventually emerged out at the Sirota Yurt Camp at 3000m. Our dinner was steaming in a huge stove but even with the makeshift campfire and yurt we were sleeping in, I shivered all night under the Milky Way - it was an incredible day.

Day 2 was the most strenuous day, we continued hiking up the Valley which narrowed more into a canyon, and the river became a waterfall showing how steep it was- we more like scrambled up the scree and rocks, but then soon a turquoise slither appeared above the rock and as we climbed the Ala Kul lake lay beneath a black craggy ridge at 3500m - it was amazing. 
But it only got better, as we continued climbing up a slope we rounded a corner and the rest of the lake was visible, with a glacier sliding down from towering snow-capped mountains down to the lake. As a geography lover I was soo excited and overwhelmed to see a glacier in all its might albeit just a small one. The climb didn’t finish there and it only got steeper as we scrambled up a gravel slope to a pass at 3900m it took an hour just for a hundred metres. The pass had near-vertical drops on both sides and opened out onto huge views on both sides, white peaks hovered above the near ridges and I felt to be hiking in a new mountain world in the sky. We ate lunch at this pass, battered by the hail and then began our descent over the edge. It was the one part I was actually nervous for because it was so steep and we had no sticks so we side stepped down the slope digging our feet in to grip as much as possible. My friend slipped down quite a bit. When we finally rejoined a proper path at the bottom of this slope, looking back up it appeared no less than a vertical wall we’d gone down. But at the bottom was snow and this made me happy haha. The rest of our journey was mainly downhill so we hiked with pace until our path became a forest too dense to continue through so we had to cross a river with no bridge. We jumped across the wet rocks on all fours and finally to the other bank. To cross back over we managed to search out a log in the forest further down and eventually made it to our yurt camp for the second night at Altyn Arashan. I ached and felt exhausted, this night sleeping warm under two duvets.

Day 3 was a short day and we walked quickly cutting the 5 hour to just over 3 hour trek. It was downhill through a green canyon and we were back at the hostel for lunch!

In between the very beginning of September and the end November, I will be voyaging though the Northern provinces of India and i need some help from you on organizing/prioritizing my trip itinerary.

I'm trying to fit in few things - a proper, i guess a semi-fast travel through the regions of Pradesh - (Manali, ??), Ladakh (Leh, Nubra, ??) and Kashmir (Bandipota, Srinagar, ??), Nepal (Pokhara, Annapurna, ??), Sikkim and West Bengal. Another of my requirements is a 3week - 1 month stay at an Ashram in Rishikesh. Somewhere in between i will try to fit some 'must-see' places like Agra, Jaipur and Delhi. 
Undoubtedly, there is more places to see than those i put in the brackets, and I'm aware of the controversy between my time allowance and my wish to travel at relatively slow pace. I am quite stressed out by the changes of climate conditions in most of these regions during this period, since I'm hoping to do some mountain hikes in Kashmir and Nepal too. I'm definitely willing to leave out tourist-hotspot places for the ones that have limited access during winter seasons or offer most of the cultural warmness and wonders that India has to offer. 

Since my trip to India is still quite uneducated, I'm very open to do changes and modifications - regardless of their radicality. Suggest me whatever thay you wished to see one time, changed your view on India, enriched you or simply touched the bottom of your heart!

I'm 21 year old male living in The Netherlands.

Last week I had one of the best experiences of my life when I went and visited two girls in France who I hosted a few months ago through the couch surfing app. They were both very loose and open minded and lived from day till day everyday I was there. I didn't have any close friends or family who have the same approach to live so it was very new to me. AND I LOVED IT!!! 

I would really like to be able to experience and meet people alike before I go and start my study in September. It really is a last minute plan, but I will be preparing the best way I can before heading out. I hope there's someone out there who I can join or wants to start a trip together!! If so hit me up in dm. I'm keen to call or videocall if you want to.

Most of my gear I am trying to get is 'lightweight' however I am torn on what type of backpack to get.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really considering the Aether 55 but it is considered ""heavy"" but its barely 2 more lbs than Ospreys lightest offering.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure it depends on the person but i'd like your opinions on getting an Aether vs like a Levity.

&amp;#x200B;

IMO The levity is just as expensive and lacks alot of features of something like the Aether  so that it can be lighter, but  I feel like my gear is lightweight enough for me to not mind 2 lbs of weight from something like an Aether.

tl;dr

&amp;#x200B;

What is your opinion on regular vs lightweight packs? Are the lack of features in the lighter weight pack worth 2 lbs of weight-savings?

On the backpacker gradient, I'm currently towards the casual end, but I will soon be able to do more wilderness backpacking, so I want a device that can send texts and has an SOS button if needed. 

I'm willing to pay the Garmin price tag if their satellite coverage (and/or hardware) is significantly better than other brands, but if I'm not going to be using the [InReach mini 2](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/765374) to the full potential then should I just go with something like the [SPOT X](https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/spot-x)?

I have a friend with a SPOT device and they like it, but I also don't want to buy one and then find out that I could have had significantly better coverage/tracking with a Garmin product.

I'm leaning towards just going with the Garmin for the ""buy nice or buy twice"" mantra, but I'm open to other ideas.

backpacking,"Hi! I've backpacked pretty extensively though a lot of countries, and thinking back on my experience, I feel like I had a different experience than others did while backpacking solo. I had a pretty good time socializing with people, but being an Asian-American guy, I didn't feel like people took me seriously in the social scene.

It seemed like a good number of travelers throughout (say) Europe and Southeast Asia were European/Australian for the most part who got along just fine, but I felt like I had a much harder time socializing with people despite being a relatively outgoing guy. I felt somewhat like a second-class citizen in the social scene, though I also accept that part of this might just be all in my head.

Since I'll be traveling again soon, I'm curious a) whether other Asian backpackers have experienced this or b) viewpoints from non-Asian backpackers on this.

backpacking,A 5 day 4 night trip to the Ansel Adams wilderness around 26 miles in total. Bugs were pretty bad at Ediza Lake and Cabin Lake. We had Cabin lake all to ourselves as the trail to get up there is unmaintained (I would suggest using a GPS with the trail in it to guide you if you plan on going up there as the trail is nearly nonexistent at times). But Cabin lake is a hidden gem off the JMT that allegedly has golden trout but we saw no signs of fish the day and a half we were there. There is a restoration project going on at both Garnet and Thousand Island lake so please check out the signs detailing where they have posted restoration area signs and no camping signs once you’re up there. We saw too many people camping in places they aren’t supposed to be and it’s terrible to see the restoration efforts going to waste. We had thunderstorms for the last 3 days we were there and I highly suggest using a gps device that can give you weather reports because the weather changes up there so fast it’s important to check daily!

backpacking,"For years I had a goal of completing a medium-length through hiking trail. Like many people, work and life always got in the way. While I always had my eye on the JMT the permit process is so difficult I eventually decided to attempt the TRT this year when I was between graduate school and my next job. I started in Tahoe City on July 16 and completed the trail over nine days. 

The mileage for the first five days was relatively modest -- I stopped off-trail in South Lake Tahoe on the fifth day to resupply. The largest challenge during this first leg was water availability. Fortunately I was able to get water at Watson Creek but after that I didn't have another reliable source until Galena Falls (~22 miles from Watson). There was, I think, a spring near Relay Peak but I wasn't sure it would be reliable and so didn't stop there for water. There is good water at Marlette Lake Campground and I relied on water I carried from Marlette and 2L of cached water (public, thank you trail angels) to get me from Spooner Summit to Kingsbury South.

During the second leg I pushed mileage quite a bit. The last half (ish) of the trail in four days. That was 95 miles total across 4 days with my longest day being 24 miles. The back-half of the trip was marred somewhat by smoke that blew in from the Oak Fire (Yosemite) overnight while I was camped in the Desolation Wilderness. Fortunately the air quality wasn't severely affected (and of course I was fortunate not to be in any immediate danger from the fire). Water availability was solid (at least at this time of year) from Armstrong Pass through to Tahoe City. This meant I never carried more than 3L at a time and was typically carrying 2L or less. Since I had planned to complete the second leg in 5-6 days I was carrying more food weight than necessary, but I mitigated this somewhat by eating once I realized I would definitely finish in 5 days. Being new to iso stoves (previously used Whisperlite) I also carried more fuel than I needed for the entire trip, sadly.

For those interested my key pieces of gear were:

* Pack: Granite Gear Blaze 60L

* Tent: Nemo Dragonfly 1P

* Sleeping Pad + Bag: Thermarest NeoAir XLite + Big Agnes V Notch UL (40 degree)

* Backpacker's Cache Bear Canister

A friend and i are going to southeast asia in september for a 2,5 month long adventure. Therefore i am looking for a great backpack to bring along on the trip. And hopefully also one to last me many years to come.  
I have looked at the Osprey farpoint 55 and 70 mainly because of the detachable daypack. I am a bit in doubt about which size to get. On one side it is nice to have it minimalistic. But on the other hand i could just go ahead and not fill the 70L to the brim and then save some space for final souveneirs.  
I have a couple of questions:  
Which backpacks can you recommend around the 50-70L range?

What are the key differences between the farpoint and farpoint trek (for you Osprey-fans out there)?

backpacking,"Hi there,  


After 5 long years of not travelling for an extended period, I've finally booked a ticket again, to Tanzania. I'm really excited and have never been to Africa.

I'm looking for some travel tips. I know Tanzania is most known for climbing Kilimanjaro and Safaris but after doing some research those activities are super expensive so I might just do 1 small Safari. I'm mostly interested in **culture, markets, food and beautiful scenery** and I'll be staying in hostels as much as possible.  


My ""plan"" is to have little to no plan but just some map pins that I'd like to visit during the **30 day trip.**  I'll probably get the hell out of Dar as quick as possible.

For instance, I already know that I want to go to **Moshi (near Kilimanjaro), Arusha, Ngorongoro Crater, and perhaps the Serengeti if it's not too expensive, Zanzibar and Mafia Island.**   


Those of you who are familiar with the region, do you have any ""DON'T MISS THIS"" places?

Thank you!",Going backpacking in Tanzania in October! - Looking for tips!,,pimmeye,,7,2022-08-03 10:49:35

backpacking,"\[Repost - Forgot flair last time\]

I am currently trying to gear up for a trip next March (2023) to Patagonia. I am doing the W-Circuit in 5 days (all camping/backpacking) and struggling to find gear advice (most of the blogs have refugio-based itineraries and gear recommendations).

I'm a novice at this although I am going with a group; most have backpacked shorter lengths in other terrain but honestly seemed to know very little about Patagonia.

I'm fairly set on most of my gear, but there are a few questions I still have about gear:

* How big of a backpack do I need for 5 days? Will 55L be sufficient? Or do I need to go up to 70L?
   * I'm guessing this comes down to whether I buy food at the campsites or carry all of my own.
   * I will not be renting gear at all so tent and sleeping system are coming with me.
* What is the terrain generally like? Will I need hiking boots? Or will hiking shoes or even trail running shoes be sufficient? I'm trying to keep weight down.
* March is technically wet season - will I need waterproofing on my shoes?

Any advice would be appreciated!","Gear Considerations for W-Circuit (Torres Del Paines, Chilean Patagonia)",,_zeejet_,,1,2022-08-02 21:53:04

backpacking,"Hi! I'm a 23F American planning a 6 week solo trip through Central America. My plan is to go in with a lot of information and a loose plan, then go with the flow from there (might be notable that I only speak basic conversational Spanish, but plan on trying my best to improve while there). I want to focus on experiencing the nature of the region, but since I'm a female solo traveller safety is my primary concern. 

When reading other peoples' experiences, I'm seeing a lot of mentions of chicken buses, minivans, and hostel shuttles. How safe, reliable, and overall tolerable are any of these options, specifically for long distances? And how easy would it be for me to book tickets last minute for transit to different areas/countries? 

For example, would it be stupid for me to take a chicken bus from Guatemala City to Laquin by myself? Are shuttles/tourist buses from hostels or tour companies worth the extra money? Would taking a rideshare outside of a city be asking for abduction? Any countries I should avoid specific types of transit? I'm on a budget but willing to pay more if there is a more efficient or reliable experience.

I'm assuming plenty of backpackers book last minute bus tickets so it shouldn't be too much of an issue, but if I'm wrong about that let me know. Also, hopefully I'll find some travel buddies quickly to make transit less intimidating, but want to be prepared for when I inevitably will be alone at certain points.

backpacking,"Hi everyone. I just had a relatively creepy backpacking experience this last weekend which got me curious about what other folks have encountered while backpacking. 

I’ll start by sharing my experience. 
A friend and I did a brief 2 night trip out of Skykomish, Washington in the Central Cascades. We hiked in and set camp at a beautiful subalpine lake. Everything was good up until dark (of course). I awoke around 1am to hear what sounded like branches breaking in the near distance. I initially thought it sounded like branches on the ground being stepped on, but figured it could be branches breaking away from the tree too. To keep my freaked out mind from going wild, I told myself it was probably elk??? This went on until I finally fell asleep again. The same thing happened the following night, but to make things worse, I heard what sounded like the zipper on our rain fly being unzipped as slow as humanly possible OR like something very small was being drug across the fly of the tent very slowly. Either way, I flipped around on my horrifically squeaky inflatable pad in hopes of scaring off whatever it was, if anything at all.  Needless to say, I didn’t sleep that night, but thankfully found the tent zipper fully closed at dawn. 

I’ve heard that temperature changes can cause cracking sounds within the bark of trees, but then again a google search on branches breaking in the woods pointed me to Bigfoot, who knows. Either way, this creeped me out. I’ve never once heard sounds like that when backpacking and I’m often awake several times during the night on trips.",What’s your creepiest backpacking story?,,Sadgirl_1691,,43,2022-08-02 05:44:27

So for my equipment I've got a pair of my work boots I'm gonna wear for hiking(timberland pros), for my tent I have an Ozark trail 1 person backpacking tent(my brother has the same) but were mostly planning on staying In hostels and the huts when he get up to NH. For my backpack pack I got an arrow head 47 litter, and for water I got a big Ozarka bottle.

For food I'm probably gonna do mostly canned but I'm gonna bring my wrist rocket and some ball bearings so I can get some small game along the way(any one know the situation with permits for small game on the trail)

I'm gonna start hiking in mid August so I can hopefully get to Maine by early September so I can get back and help with some of the harvest back home

Any advice is welcome thank yall!!!!!!!",Hiking the AT for the first time next Year!,,transgalmad,,12,2022-08-01 21:37:10

backpacking,"As many of you would know, you can get some really good deals on activities while travelling if you simply go to the place and book. For example, I was in the Galapagos years ago and tour operators were offering last minute deals on liveaboard boat trips that were a fraction of the cost compared to if you booked from overseas.

So my question is: can this be applied to Antarctic boat trips departing Ushuaia, Argentina? These trips seem a lot more specialised, so I have my doubts, but they are prohibitively expensive for me when booking in my home country. Has anyone been to Ushuaia or done one of these trips? When in the area do they offer last minute deals or cheaper options? Thank you.",Last minute Antarctic deals?,,CtrlAltDlt87,,0,2022-08-01 21:25:31
backpacking,"35Km+ Hiking upto and on the ""Fjords"" of Newfoundland, and ending the trip off with a day in Rocky Harbour for the Light Festival.

This trip is highly regulated by Parks Canada; less than 200 people per year get to traverse this trail. Sending only a few groups of 4 per day for a very small window. once on this trail it is very pure; navigation and outdoor skills are pushed to their boundaries. With not even as much as a defined trail.

Getting the permit and the flights was meticulous but well worth the effort considering the views and near perfect weather we had. 20+ degrees everyday, a nice breeze and sun to bask in. The only downside is that the bugs bite and bleed you dry.

This was by far the most challenging and fun trip I've ever done. Even compared to all the Juan De Fuca, West Coast and all the trails that the Rocky Mountains in Alberta and BC have to provide.

backpacking,"I'm planning to go backpacking to Cambodia later this year. There is so many options that I don't know which backpack to choose. I'm looking at sub 30 to 40L Osprey packs, mainly Stratos 36 and Kestrel 38, but I'm also open to other models.

The main difference seems to be that Stratos uses Airspeed, while the latter uses Airscape technology. It thus seems that Stratos should be more suitable to tropical weather. The downside is that Stratos is less compact as a result.

I can have Kestrel for almost half the price of Stratos, but I wouldn't want to make a potentially huge compromise just to save 80 bucks.

backpacking,"If a gap year works out well enough, I might even forgo college in favor of finding a way to live as a nomad, but I'm under no illusions about the difficulty of such a thing. I'll tell you a bit about what I'm looking for, and how much I can take.

I'm 18, and I have a profound distaste for the Americanization which has occurred in many countries in the Caribbean and Europe, for example. This isn't out of a dislike of my own culture, but rather a belief that every land has its own distinct way of being, which cultural imperialism seeks to erode.

I've traveled as a child and as a teenager, but only really to tourist hotspots in Florida and California. I am physically fit, an Eagle Scout, and about as knowledgeable about foreign languages and cultures as one can reasonably be without having experienced them firsthand or studied them in college. This isn't to say I consider myself an expert in anything though. I fully acknowledge that I don't know what I don't know, and I love to learn. I know for a fact however that I have a knack for making a good first impression.

I don't much prefer hot or cold, but it is my belief that I can get used to either with enough time.

I'd like the first place I solo-travel to have friendly locals, few tourists, and preferably be in the Old World, rather than the New.

backpacking,"31 years old, think I've hit that point where I just can't do that hostels and the ""backpacker"" lifestyle anymore. I've stayed in probably 60-70 hostels and worked in a couple for an extended period of time as a bar tender. Done all the late nights, pub crawls, hungover walking tours etc. Had a great time in my 20s living in Europe and South America for extended periods of time.

At the end of my last trip to Colombia I started to feel over it...But I just thought that was me encountering burn out. Was hoping a break/recharge back home would inspire me to come back and love the backpacker and hostel lifestyle once again.

However I just got back from a Europe trip. loved it but.....maybe it was my age, or the time of year, or just me coming to reality, or the fact that I was following the student summer vacation travel route (barcelona, prague, budapest, etc) but I felt ""old"", out of place, and frankly jaded.

I know 31 isn't old, and as we all say, ""youre never too old for hostels"", but I just couldn't be asked to get out of bed and go get a drink with a group of 21 year olds who I've never met, and frankly don't care to meet... Nothing against them, I just had 0 motivation to make my 9000th temporary friend who I'll know for 3 days before never seeing again.

So recently I've been thinking of changing my travel style. If anyone has any ideas let me know. Yes i know ideally its best to try to make friends with locals, but frankly in many places I've been locals want nothing to do with tourists. I've considered staying in hotels, but my biggest fear is being lonely...Or looking back and regretting not manning up and just getting past my own jaded-ness.

Problem is they tend to take up a lot of weight and volume, so I can't fit them into my Osprey farpoint 40L.

Been trying to check if there is any good brands that makes shoes that are lightweight, flexible and breathable as well that can work. 

Are there any shoes that makes a decent job both as hiking and running shoes? I saw that a couple of barefoot brands tended to market themselves for a little bit of everything, could be a good choice?

A couple points....

1. Might cut a few days from Colombia - have family there so have been often, but still plenty of places I would like to see.
2. Considering doing PeruHop (my Spanish is pretty basic and this seems easy like an easy option), but I am not super interested in Huacachina and Nazca
3. Any tips/advice on Patagonia will be greatly appreciated.
4. Flying from Buenos Aires to Mexico seems expensive and far - hence the couple cells where I consider taking a direct flight to Bogota, crashing with family, then another direct to Mexico City. Or trying to fly direct into Guadalajara so that I can take a bus to Guanajuato/San Miguel Allende, then Mexico City, etc.
5. Mexico seems pretty packed, but all those places seem really cool.

backpacking,"My wife and I are planning a few multi day trips later next year and we have some questions on some of the more ""nuanced"" things about multi day trips. We have all of our gear, routes are being planned, maps being looked at and weather is being studied for the time of year we're attempting them, and our packing lists are coming together. A few of the trails we're planning are the Rim to Rim trail in the Grand Canyon (October of 23') and Rae Lakes in Kings Canyon (spring time of 24') there are a few others I'm considering, but those are the main ones we're currently planning for. 

Water. 

We hadn't even considered how people who do the super long distance trails like the PCT or the JMT, let alone the smaller multi day hikes, purify their water. What would you all consider the best method of purifying water to refill bladders and cooking water with? We know the best practices for collecting the water, but didn't think of the purifying part. This might seem like a silly question, but we both have not done anything more than an overnight that had fill stations at our destinations, so this got skipped over. (doh!) any pro tips or things you all suggest for this would be awesome. 

Sleeping pad.

I've used several and I can't figure this one out. All of the different ones i've tried have been too slim for my body type. I always end up off of it. The wider ones I've used are great for regular tent camping, but would weight too much if having to carry it in the back country. I realize I may have to just sacrifice some weight on my pack for the wider type, but I'd love some input, and some suggestions on this. I can't seem to find one I don't slip off of or have it completely against a wall of my tent lol.

I probably have some more questions, but i'm super tired right now and can't think of anymore off the top of my head. I'll be sure to update as I shuffle though our notes and packing lists. 

I'd also love to hear some tips and tricks for a first time multi day hike as well. Something you wish someone would have told you before going out on a long trek. 

and just so I don't confuse anyone ***none*** of the trails I mentioned at the beginning are going to be our first multi day hikes. those will be attempted after we ""get our feet wet"" so to speak. We have plenty of smaller and easier training hikes we're planning before the bigger 20+ mile ones we've got planned. We're not due to set out for those trails for well over a year.

Holiday travel is a busy and stressful time for people as they head to their holiday destinations. Whether it’s holiday travel or summer vacation, **family travel tips** can help ease the stress.

Icy and snowy roads, canceled flights, weather delays, and crowded roadways and airports – be prepared for a busy holiday travel season. In the midst of holiday travel stress, don’t forget the kids.  


For adults, the delays and frustrations of traveling during winter or summer can be stressful for many. However, adding kids to the mix can make this time even more difficult. From kids young to old, traveling can be a huge burden on them as well.  


I spent some time traveling at Thanksgiving with my kids. One of the things that most people worry about when traveling with kids is how those kids are affecting other passengers. However, making travel fun for kids is just one of a few important family travel tips.  


I have talked to other parents who have kids of various ages and asked them for advice when traveling. Based on the advice and experience of others, here are some useful family travel tips on things you need to know and how you can make traveling with kids fun:  


### Family travel tips – Airplanes and airports

**Bring identification for your kids** – For kids under 2, this is essential. Believe it or not, airlines are not as worried about whether the kid is yours as they are making sure you pay for a seat for a child over 2. While the airlines may not request to see if, for your young ones, you may not be allowed to board if you don’t have it. A birth certificate (for children under 2) or photo id is sufficient. If you are traveling overseas, ALL children (regardless of age) must have a passport.  


**The airport** \- The airport can be a stressful place for the holidays, especially with little kids running around. Once you are inside the airport, make the experience fun for the kids as they check out the airplanes and have fun before you get on your flight.  


*Family travel tip for airports- check to see if your airport has a family security line.*  


**Pre-flight entertainment** \- If your kids are really young but mobile, an airport can be a fascinating place. Get there early, show them the planes arriving and taking off, and allow them to wander around (safely) and explore. Crowds of people and busy airports may be a necessary frustration for adults but can be fascinating and entertaining to young kids.  


**Snacks, drinks, and food** \- If you are still breast or bottle feeding your child, you are allowed to take as much breast milk or formula “as necessary” for the trip. Remember that delays or missed flights could mean hours of crying if you don’t have enough.  


Plan ahead, pack it in a lunch cooler, keep it cold with some ice once inside security, and pack as many snacks as you want. Remember that all other drinks must be bought once you are through security. If your child is drinking whole milk, this can be hard to find at fast food places and restaurants in the airport. So pack that to take with you as well and say you are still feeding your child.  


For all kids, pack some snacks and food and maybe some sandwiches if you don’t want to pay for expensive airport or airplane food. And remember that the rule for all other liquids still applies (the 3-1-1 rule).  


**On-board entertainment (3 and under )** – Kids age 3 and under may not really understand what is going on so the flight, while something new, maybe a major interruption to their schedule.  


Family travel tips for young kids – Be patient and spend a lot of hands-on time with them. Trade off with your spouse, partner, friends, or family if they are traveling with you.  


For younger kids, pack a bag just for them filled with new toys, games, coloring books, and snacks. Give them something to eat or drink when you take off and land to help the pressure in their ears. Entertain them by pulling out new things to play with. And when they are tired of that, pull out something else new and exciting (dollar store gifts are great for travel). Take the little ones for a walk up and down the aisle if necessary (and when safe to do so) and meet the flight attendants.  


If you can afford it, bring along the car seat if it will make your child more comfortable (it’s also safer). The key is to be creative and make this as fun as possible. There may be some rough moments but realize that sometimes a tired child is just going to be fussy.  


**On-board entertainment (3 and older)** \- For older kids, this really isn’t a problem as they have their iPods, iPhones, video games, and in-flight entertainment to keep them entertained. If you have kids still used to nap time, set aside a nap time on the plane.  


While long flights can be tough, be creative. Makeup stories using the safety manual giving the characters' names. Make your air sickness bag a puppet and have your child draw and color it. If they are old enough, provide some reading material on your destination and learn some facts about where you are going. Makeup games or plan “to do” lists for when you arrive and let your child have input.  


*Family travel tips for older kids - While they can keep themselves entertained, make sure you include them in the trip as well.*  


### Family travel tips – Road trips

**Plan ahead -** Take your time, plan ahead, and don’t be in a hurry. With rain, snow, and a lot of cars on the road, holidays and summer are busy times of the year. Give yourself plenty of time to get to your destination.  


**Plan breaks for long trips -** Adults may be able to take turns driving and go for hours without taking a break. Kids need a break and parents will be thankful they took one when traveling with kids. From babies to older kids, they need a change of scenery.  


For little ones, taking a break and running around may tire them out for a nap in the car. Stretching the legs, grabbing a bite to eat, or changing a diaper can help re-fuel everyone and make for a more pleasant journey.  
**Family travel tip for long road trips-**  Stop and smell the roses along the way as you take breaks to stretch, eat, or even play.  


**Entertainment -** Older kids are able to sit still for longer periods, know what is going on, and have numerous things to entertain themselves. Young ones may need to be fed, changed, or entertained. Toys, games, and movies are often good ways to entertain kids for hours. However, make them a part of the journey.  


Play games where you find things with each letter of the alphabet or see who can find the most license plates from different states. Sing Christmas or holiday songs. Be wary of being the “boring” parent – let them come up with ideas for what to do in the car. Plan it ahead of time. Talk about your destination and play games. Rotate seats after each stop (make sure your kids meet the height and weight requirements to sit in the front).  


Have playtime with the baby in the back seat. Talk about things you are thankful for. Technology and toys can be a wonderful thing but keep them engaged as well. It might surprise you how much the kids will remember and appreciate the things you did on the trip.  


### Family travel tips – Arriving at your destination

**Plan time for the kids -** Holidays with family or summer vacations can be extremely busy as you have a lot to do and a lot of people to see in a short amount of time. However, plan time for the kids to have fun as well. Make a special date to take them out to a restaurant or fast food place of their choice. Take them to see a movie. If the weather is nice where you are going, spend some time at the park. Give your kids time to still be kids.  


**Family travel tips for the kids-** Set aside some special time just for them to do something they want to do.  


Know your kids and make them a part of the trip - This can vary a lot based on where you are going and who you are with. If your kids are really active, give them an assignment once they get there – let them be in charge of passing out the Christmas gifts or setting the table with a name tag for each person (you may know all the relatives there but they may not).  


Set aside an hour of quality time for each kid to watch a movie, play, or do whatever they want to do. Give them a “small” gift to say thanks for being a part of the family and for being so well behaved. Know your child, what motivates them, and do what you can to make this time special for them as well.  


**Family travel tips for the kids and trips -** Make them a part of the planning process and they will look forward to the vacation since they feel like they are a part of it.  


### Make holiday travel and summer vacations with the kids fun

Enjoy the holidays and vacations with your family and realize that traveling with kids doesn’t necessarily mean stress, frustration, or yelling. Despite all the hassle, the holidays are a good time of year to give thanks for travel.  


Family travel tips are a way to help you and your kids enjoy holiday travels and summer vacations.  


Take the time to spend with them and let them be a part of the trip. Years from now, their best memories will be the time you spent together as a family!

backpacking,"Hi travelers,

I have booked flights for November to solo travel around Morocco, Spain and Portugal and am trying to figure out what is worth seeing, what some of the must sees are and what some of the tourist traps are that I can skip.

I am flying into Casablanca and out of Madrid a month later. I thought I would spend around 10 days in each country but don't know if that's a fair split or if one of them warrants much more or less time. In terms of interest, I would say I am equally excited about Morocco and Spain and perhaps a bit less interested in Portugal, if that helps divide my time at all.

I would say my interests are primarily cultural, culinary and historical rather than more nature/outdoorsy unless there's a truly must see nature spot. I speak fluent French and some Spanish, but no Portuguese, so navigating Morocco and Spain may also be slightly easier than Portugal.

I'm hoping reddit might be able to help me figure out a rough itinerary for things I should see over those 30 days.

So far, my must sees are Marrakesh, Fes, (I would like to see Gibraltar if possible), Chefchaouen, Lisbon, Porto, Seville, Madrid and Barcelona. With that said, my knowledge of these three countries is fairly limited so I'm also not sure what the true ""must sees"" are that I am missing from this list.

Any help would be appreciated! Thank you!","Itinerary help for 1 month in Morocco, Spain and Portugal",,senatorsloth,,9,2022-07-29 04:21:15

When I'm in my local mountain range (Sierras Nevadas in CA),  my pack weight ends up being \~55lbs (it's so heavy because the climbing gear adds approximately 20lbs per person).  Does your fused spine take weight well? yes I know most of the weight is on your hip belt, but there is still a good deal of momentary compression of the spine from the shoulder straps.

The bare-faced rock climbs are steep to the point of needing cables to assist in the ascent. But the sketchiest part was just beyond the cables where there is nothing but a crack in the slab to hold on to as you make your final approach to the summit. 

If you are looking for excitement, consider putting your trust solely in the friction of your boots and grip of your finger tips to get the blood pumping. As one misstep here will turn into a long, potentially deadly, nipple grinding tumble.

backpacking,"  
After flying for a number of years, I’ve observed many rude airline passengers and bad behavior.

[mortraveling.com](https://preview.redd.it/u53y6s25lce91.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0019cf42d38d265891f84c6476d7558fa0c470c6)

Sure, airline travel isn’t always fun. Thankfully we have an airline passenger bill of rights to protect us against bad airline behavior. When travel goes wrong and it takes 27 hours to fly from Dublin to California or have your worst travel day ever, you can either laugh or cry.  


You can even have an entire airline grounded by a computer glitch and make a long travel day even longer. And let’s be honest – flying on the airlines themselves isn’t always fun. I’ve got quite a list of airline complaints.  


However, we can’t always do anything about travel delays, bad airlines, or bad travel experiences. Each of us has our own pet peeves when it comes to bad airline behavior from fellow passengers.  


Here are a few tips for those rude airline passengers.  


## 5 tips for rude airline passengers

From boarding to landing and everything in between, follow these tips to avoid becoming that airline passenger everyone hates.  


### If you’re sitting in the back of the plane, take your bags with you

You’ve seen this passenger! They board the plane, stick their bags in one of the overhead bins near the front of the plane, and then walk to their seat in the back. This is rude, selfish, and actually holds up the entire flight.  
If you’re sitting in the back of the plane, take your bags with you. When you put your bags in the front of the plane, the passengers in those seats don’t have anywhere to put their bags. Flight attendants and passengers have to scramble to find a place for luggage at the back of the plane – where you’re already sitting. The flight is delayed taking off and passengers are delayed getting off the plane because they can’t get their bags.  


For me, this is my biggest pet peeve with rude airline passengers. Don’t be so selfish. Flight attendants, the airlines, and other passengers would appreciate it if you would sit with your own bags.  


### Keep your feet to yourself

I understand that flying can be uncomfortable. Cramped seats with little legroom mean an uncomfortable flight. However, this isn’t your home either.  


I don’t like feet and I don’t want to see your feet on the flight. If you need to take your shoes off, put socks on or make sure your feet don’t smell.  


I know many people wear sandals, flip flops, jandals, and thongs (or various other open-toed shoe options) when it’s hot. I’d prefer it if you covered your feet but at least be considerate of others who may not want to see or smell your feet.  


### Watch your kids

I am sensitive to kids who travel. Flying isn’t easy for adults, much less for those young kids, with shorter attention spans, and lots of energy. However, parents who completely ignore their kids the entire flight and let them do whatever they want are not being considerate of other passengers.  


If your kids are kicking the seat in front of them and screaming non-stop, at least make an attempt to comfort them and stop them from kicking the seat.  


To be fair, airlines aren’t always kind or fair to families (especially with this idea of a family airline fee) but at least be mindful of your kids and their behavior. I understand you can’t always keep kids happy but don’t let them be a complete nuisance on the flight. At least make an effort to entertain them and stop out-of-control behavior.

### Know how to store your luggage in the overhead bin

#### Tip #1 – Put your carry-on suitcase in the overhead bin vertically.

That’s how the bags were designed. By putting them vertically, rather than horizontally, you can fit 3 bags in there instead of two. Also, flight attendants and other passengers don’t have to take the time to re-arrange their luggage to accommodate everyone else’s carry-on.  


#### Tip #2 – If you have two carry-on items, place one underneath your seat.

This is normal airline policy. However, it’s also a courtesy to other passengers. If you have a jacket or coat, place it in the overhead bin (after all other luggage is stored first).  


I always carry a backpack plus my carry-on luggage (a bigger backpack with my clothes). The smaller backpack always goes underneath my seat. Sure, I would love to have a lot more room for my feet but I also like keeping my bag close and considering the limited space requirements on an airplane.  


I know airline fees are ridiculous at times. However, if you are going to bring your luggage on board please know how to store it properly. It saves space for other passengers and cuts down onboarding time.  


### Beware of your reclining seat

OK, I get it. I have a lot of sympathy for really tall people that have to sit in coach. Legroom is constantly shrinking and you need more space.  


However, just because you reach 10,000 feet doesn’t mean you can recline your seat into the lap of the person behind you.  


Be courteous. We are all cramped. By all means, recline. However, only recline as far as you need.  


* If you want to sleep, recline.
* If you need a little more legroom, recline a little.

### This airspace is your space, this airspace is my space

Airline mergers, fewer flights, rising costs of flights, travel delays, and cancellations – we all understand the frustrations of flying. However, let’s make the actual flying experience as painless as possible.  


I’m a big fan of connecting with people when you travel and have talked about conversations with strangers on a plane. However, be respectful of other people’s space when flying.  


We can’t prevent all the other travel frustrations that come with air travel. However, we can show respect to one another.  


So remember the next time you fly, please don’t be one of those rude airline passengers. Fly respectfully, travel passionately, and enjoy the views out of your airplane window.  


Fewer rude airline passengers mean shorter boarding times, more pleasant flights, and less stress for all of us.",5 tips for rude airline passengers,,Mortraveling,,2,2022-07-28 17:56:52

backpacking,"Hey! I'll be travelling round NZ for a year and I'm unsure of what type of bag to bring. I'll definitely be taking a small (~21L) backpack with me but for my main bag I'm not sure whether to go with a 60L backpack (one on the front one on the back type situation) or go with a 100L wheeled holdall that also turns into a backpack. The 100L one seems massive but more convenient with those tempting wheels. The 60L backpack is also tempting because it's smaller but a bit unsure about the practicality of one bag on the front one on the back. 

My itinerary is basically unplanned at this point so I'm not sure how much hiking or camping I'd be doing (but the hopeful plan is that I get myself a campervan out there anyway). 
Another factor is that the 60L bag would be a woman's fit (perfect for me) whereas the 100L mule wouldn't be, which would eventually get more uncomfortable (I can imagine). 

I'm a complete newbie with backpacking and have no experience in this at all! 

The bags in question are the [Berghaus Torridon 60](https://www.e-outdoor.co.uk/p/Berghaus_Torridon_60L_Womens_Backpack/) and the [Berghaus 100L wheeled mule.](https://e-outdoor.co.uk/p/berghaus_expedition_mule_100l_wheeled_holdall/)

Logic is telling me to go for the 60L one but there's a part of me that wants the mule too! I like a bag that I can easily access a sizeable portion of it and the 60L one is a top loading bag so it might be difficult to get into the guts of it, whereas the 100L one would open up easier. And just because it's 100L doesn't mean I have to /pack/ 100L worth of stuff. But another concern is if that 100L would fit in hostel lockers.",Advice on what kind of bag to take for a year's travel,,graciconix,,11,2022-07-27 11:32:52

backpacking,"Hi,

I am Canadian and my previous backpacking experience was 3 times in Japan and 1 time in China. I have travelled to the USA plenty of times too, but less ""backpacking"" but more like roadtrips. Oh and Cuba I guess if that counts for anything haha..!  


I am going to Peru this time and it will be the first major trip with my girlfriend, so security is a bit more of a concern as I don't have to fend only for myself now :)

Jokes aside, I have never felt any concerns regarding safety before. However, Peru (and perhaps most of South America) seems prone to petty crimes like pickpocketing and possibly robbing.

I try to be optimistic and think that this is possibly a case of a vocal minority, but will we need to be THAT careful all the time? Like, if we're not, is there like a 50% chance we'll get robbed? What about hostels, are they generally alright? Is there a significant chance the staff would steal from us?

We are going to do the ""basic"" trip as we have only 2 weeks, so Lima-Paracas, Huacachina, Arequipa, Colca Canyon, Cusco, Machu Pichu.

Lima seems to be obviously a concern, so we'll probably not go too far around our hostel. we'll be tired from the trip anyways. But what about the other areas? Do I really have to travel like a homeless? Not that I travel in luxury anyways, but I never feared someone would still my watch or phone right off my hand.

Hopefully I don't sound too much like a dumb dumb and we are initially prepared for the ""worst"", but we'd like to slack off and actually relax without having to doubt everyone and watch ourselves all the time if possible.

So any tips on safe/unsafe areas would be great. We know about the basics of carrying just the minimum amount of cash and in different locations, carrying our backpacks in front of us, wearing one of those belt wallet thingy under our pants, etc. Other good tips are welcome.

backpacking,"Over the summer I've been getting more into backpacking and have been contemplating doing a longer solo trip in late January-early February for my 40th birthday. Trouble is that aforementioned birthday is, indeed, in early February. One initial thought was to do a 5-day Zion/Bryce/Grand Canyon hiking trip, but temperatures thenabouts are expected to be in the 20°F-30°F range, and I'm not *quite* hardcore enough yet to do cold weather/snow camping.

I've been doing research into national parks and forests in the southwest (California, Arizona, New Mexico, south Texas, preference for arid climes to humid, i.e., Alabama, Florida), and some looking into BLM areas as an option. I'd be curious to hear about places where folks have built and honed their outdoors skills, especially sites that allow for more remote camping and have opportunities for some good hiking but aren't totally off the grid.

Skill assessment-wise, I'm probably somewhere between front and backcountry in terms of wilderness knowledge and experience, the closest to the latter being 2-3 day stays in state parks and hiking about 1-2 miles to a site, with access to potable water and toilets. It sounds like the further west one goes the more dispersed camping there is (if avoiding group campsites), so I'd want to develop a few more survival skills to feel confident/safe before trying anything like that.

backpacking,"I've now been travelling for almost a month and I gotta admit - I'm running out of energy. But I still have 3 weeks to go. 
Because I'm on a tight budget I've been walking a LOT on my trip, almost 700km in total so far. Exploring every inch of a city center, hiking high up into the mountains or just walking to save money on public transport. Sometimes with the heavy backpack, sometimes with a daypack. But in general: walking, walking, walking. 
In the beginning that was great and I basicly on my feet all day but recently I often find myself just sitting somewhere waiting for time to pass. I've sprinkled in the occasional beach day but that only refueled me for one day max. 
I'm also getting annoyed at hostels where there's ALWAYS ONE GUY SNORING AS IF HIS LIFE DEPENDED ON IT! IN EVERY SINGLE DORM FOR ONE MONTH! HOW IS THIS STATISTICLY POSSIBLE?! 
Also moving to new places so much is getting exhausting. 
At this point I feel like I just want to be home and do nothing for a week. Not go out, not talk to anyone, just chill. But at the same time I really don't want my trip to end either...

backpacking,"Any help would be appreciated.

Me and my gf are supposed to go  from Zagreb-Bali on 14th of August and have a return flight on 15 of September

But after booking the flight,i started to have severe pain in my right arm,after visiting the doctor it turns out i need to have an operation to extract a metal part from my arm that was put there 3 years ago,and after extraction i need to have 4 weeks of physical therapy.

I called Turkish airlines to ask about this, if there is a possibility to change the departure date to somewhere around a month later,but they say that it isn't a possibility and state that i have to pay 5300 USD to change the flight.

Is there anything i can do about this situation? i have all necessary documents proving that i am having the operation.

I read online that there is a rule for a flight to be postponed free of charge if there is a valid medical reason.

Do you know is there is a way to go about this?
thank you in advance

UPDATE: after countless hours of talking with the Turkish airline,i managed to change the itinerary completely, unfortunately instead of going to Bali, its Seoul in Korea,also a place i wanted to visit,guess Bali is gonna have to wait, fee of 300€ still,lesson learned next time buying travel insurance DEFINITELY!",flight date change due to medical reasons,,Boring-Thing-6024,,7,2022-07-26 07:39:35

Turns out he really likes it and would like to again. The problem is that he’s 6’3” and pretty thin. Not very much fat between his skin and his bones, and the shoulder straps rubbed his collarbones raw after one day of hiking. He has a 23” torso and the pack is the correct size for his body. His collarbones also protrude more than the average persons. 

The pack was really great other than that. That way the strap hit his collarbone, I don’t think it was a fault of the pack and I feel like most packs would have this affect on him(because the way his collarbone protrudes). I’m wondering if anyone out there has had this problem and if they have found a solution that works for them? A pack that works for them or something? Thanks in advance!

I'm a woman with a very short back (5'1) and wide shoulders, and I haven't had a backpack that fit me since I was 13. But with a longer trip to the sierras coming up, I realized my ill-fitting,  disintegrating, 30L backpack wasn't going to cut it.

But I haven't been able to find anything that fits. The backpacks listed below are the ones that showed the most promise, though the Osprey Men's is the only Men's pack I've tried. 

So far Ive tried:
.
.

**Osprey Women's Ariel 55L** 

- Cons: shoulder straps are so tight they cut off blood flow to my arms 

- Pros: the is the right length, hip pads are comfortable, and no large gap between my back and the backpack
.
.


**Deuter Women's small** 

- Cons: shoulder straps are way too high - I had about 2/3 inches of space between the straps and my shoulders

- Pros: comfortable hip pads, arms have blood flow, no large gap between my back and the backpack
.
.

**Osprey Men's Atmos 65L small/medium**

- Cons: shoulder straps *slightly* too wide, but not by much. A large gap between my lower back and the backpack, about 2 - 2.5 inches. I could feel my back get stiff while wearing it in the store.

- Pros: shoulder straps sit on my shoulders, back is the right hight, I have bloodflow to my arms! + generous hip padding. 
.
.
.

TLDR:
Any recommendations for short torso/ wide shoulders? Men's Osprey Atmos fit best - are there any packs like that wod ride closer to my back? Any way to customize these packs?",Custom backpack alterations? Help a short woman with wide shoulders :(,,MyGrandpasGotTalent,,10,2022-07-25 00:47:44

backpacking,"I used to be in forestry and do block layout. I would basically just walk all day long through the bush off trail and I had to do it at a pretty decent clip too. I switched occupations to carpentry and I doubt I'd be able to do anything like that anymore - I'm simply not in nearly as good a shape as I used to be.

However, I've been really missing the outdoors lately and want to get back at it. A friend of mine invited me on a day trip with a decent amount of elevation. I'm sure if I were to attempt that without trying to get in to shape first I would be absolutely miserable, certainly the next day anyway.

I'm not terribly out of shape, I don't think I need to lose any weight, but muscular endurance could probably be improved on.

I suppose if I had more time I could just go on a bunch of smaller hikes that are gradually getting longer in duration, but I still have a full-time job so I only have limited evenings and weekends.

backpacking,"More of an academic question. I'm troubleshooting the knee pain I experience on downhill mountain hikes, particularly when carrying a backpack. Since the pain started, I've tried two different techniques with  interesting results:

Technique 1: Use my quadriceps to ""brake"" with each step, softening the footfalls and minimizing the pounding on my joints. When I do this, the pain invariably starts shortly after beginning the descent and is severe by the end of the hike (typically four or five hours).

Technique 2: Allow myself to ""fall"" forward with each step, engaging the muscles for stability but no more deceleration than is necessary to avoid losing control. This results in very heavy footfalls and a lot of impact, especially with a pack, but the result is WAY BETTER. I don't think anyone's knees feel fresh after a mountain descent, but I have a lot more success stomping downhill than I do when actively braking.

How are your experiences with this, and can anyone offer insight into the mechanics at work here? I've read so much about how each downhill footfall impacts the knee with ""10 times your body weight"" or whatever, so my experience is totally counterintuitive to me. Are the knee's tissues more vulnerable to the forces of deceleration than impact of repeated pounding?

FWIW, I'm a 36M, 5' 8"", 140 lbs.","Which is harder on knees: impact force of landing, or controlled deceleration?",,Vaito_Fugue,,5,2022-07-24 01:11:11

backpacking,"tldr: looking to upgrade a couple things to shed some base weight with a $200 budget


Hey everyone, I am getting back into backpacking after 8 years and am gathering some of my old gear and collecting some new gear.  A buddy and I are wanting to hike a 5-6 day/50-80 mile section of the AT next year and are doing a couple of short trips this summer/fall and next spring to prepare.

I have put together most of my packing list (https://lighterpack.com/r/dfzqax), and am looking for recommendations for upgrading some items to lighten my pack weight.  I am hoping to keep these improvements lower budget ($100-200 total).

Most of my gear is stuff that I still have from my scouting years; 2 trips to Philmont and a few separate backpacking trips as a scout and as an adult leader. I know that Philmont and scouting don’t really do lightweight/ultralight, so I am hoping to upgrade some of the heavier things for something lighter and better. I am currently around 20lb base weight for my pack (is this good for general/lightweight backpacking or am I on the higher end?)

In some cases, I know that there are some things I could go without, such as the extra foam sleeping pad, and the phone tripod, but I am hoping to upgrade some other things to maybe be able to keep those, as I really love the extra comfort for a good nights sleep and love to take pictures while I am out.

I think the biggest one I am looking at is the pack itself.  It is an 80L Kelty pack that I have used on a few trips in scouting. It served me well for Philmont, when extra crew gear was needed, but am aware that it is larger than my current needs and am considering getting a smaller pack, like the REI Flash 55, which would use most of my desired budget, but shave down ~4lbs.

Additionally, I am looking at upgrading the tent.  I see that the REI Groundbreaker 2p tent is currently on sale and wondered if anyone had any experiences to share with that tent?  My current tent is a 2p+ (102oz w/ tarp footprint), which would allow us to keep our bags with us in the tent overnight, and have a little extra space, whereas the Groundbreaker (84oz w/ footprint) seems to be a bit smaller, and would only save ~20oz.

I am also torn between going with a bear cannister or hanging a bear bag, to save some weight.  I see a lot of people ripping on bear bags and how most people do them wrong.  I have done them at Philmont and other trips, but would be concerned that I might just end up being another one doing them wrong. Any thoughts?

I have also included ~2lb of food/day for 3 days and carrying 2.5L as an overestimation, in case running water is not abundant.

There are a couple things still missing from the list such as a small first aid kit, tent/pad patches, and pack rain cover because I haven’t picked them out and don’t have weights. If there is anything else that I am missing that you think I should include, please let me know!

I am posting here instead of the UL sub, as I am hoping for some actual advice. Some UL advice I am not looking for:

“Your sleeping pad weighs more than my total pack weight”

Everytime I'm carrying a heavy load with a backpack, it presses my jeans against the part just above my tailbone. And also there's a loop on that part of my pants so I can use a belt ; it makes the thing even more painful. It's so annoying and painful. I can't find a way to avoid that.

My plan is to explore Vietnam (mostly northern Vietnam) and then hop to Cambodia for a couple of days to check out angkor wat. I'd like to spend my final days relaxing somewhere at a beach town (not a resort like place), if possible I'd like to learn how to scubadive. 
Any recs for places that are easy (I'm willing to fly ofc) to reach from Vietnam or Cambodia? I have already been to thailand, but I'd not mind going back.

backpacking,"Hi Reddit, avid car camper and hiker here looking to get into the world of backpacking. I dont know anyone who goes on these types of excursions, so I have zero guidance other than reading material, and this community. I know it's an absolute leap from one to the other, but over the past year I've become very interested in trying it out.  Home base for me is Boston Proper, so I'm here looking for some Northeastern US reccomendations to go for a weekend, maybe a long weekend. Loops are proffered, but thru hikes are welcome as well. I don't mind a 2 or 3 hour drive. I just want to make sure I'm doing more outdooring than I am driving. I'm aware that camping anywhere on the East Coast is usually pretty regulated and thus not very wild, but any suggestions on where to get started helps!

backpacking,"I’m in a situation in which no one I know in real life can truly understand me and help me make the right decision, thought I’d ask here because my brain is going 200 miles an hour with thoughts.

So I’m a 21 year old guy, living the normal life, go to my job, work out, do some stuff at home, sleep and repeat. Had really no success in dating in the past few years. ( By no success I mean I haven’t had a connection with anyone, but met a lot of girls ). 

3 weeks ago I managed to match with a girl on Tinder, she messaged me and we met shortly after, with nothing in mind, thinking it was just another meet up that won’t lead to anything.

We really connected and kept meeting regularly the past weeks. I’m Maltese and she’s here for 6 weeks before going to Asia for 6 months. 

Long story short, she told me that she planned to do this on her own but she really wants me to get with her. (This is also a surprise to her, and I can tell that she’s not lying)

I’ve been thinking about travelling solo for a long time, I feel lost/depressed in my day to day life with no purpose and barely any friends to meet.

I really want to go with her and backpack through Asia, but the catch is my job. I landed this very good job 4 months ago that I really like and I don’t even know how I can ask them for 6 months of unpaid leave whilst keeping my position, I think it’s highly unlikely that they’ll accept. What makes things harder is that I knew my boss from before and he did his best to get me employed here.

On the other hand, when this girl leaves, I’m sure I’ll be in my previous position of being lost again, so my current perspective of local life is a bit skewed because I’m happy now. 

The ultimatum is, should I sacrifice my job to spend 6 months backpacking, which could possibly result in a life-long effect on my mentality, or should I keep my job and possibly live with life-long regret that I didn’t take this opportunity whilst I’m still 21 and probably never see her again.",Should I take the leap of faith?,,Respect_the_Homies,,90,2022-07-22 10:35:49

This is my first Reddit post! 
I 28(f) am going traveling with my 29(f) best friend from October 1st, we’re both English.

Looking for some advice:
-what weight limit do we need (edit: for our bags on the plane)? We are both 5ft ish and they seem to take 20kg 

-our plan is 2 weeks in N.Thailand, just under 2 weeks in Laos, a month in Vietnam, 2 weeks in Cambodia, 2 weeks in S.Thailand, 3 weeks in Malaysia and a few days to finish in Singapore. Thoughts? Does this sound about right? 

- we plan to be in Malaysia for Christmas and new year, any recommendations? 

Pretty flexible with our plans, ready to listen to experts! 
Cheers guys!

Edit; forgot to mention we aren’t big on climbing through the jungle unless there are cable cars.

backpacking,"I just recently returned from a trip to Glacier National Park and picked up a Talon 22 for the journey. I had originally ordered the REI Co-op Trail 40 but sadly it didn’t fit me and seemed a little too big for my daypack needs. The Talon 22 fits well and is a decent size when not using a bladder, but my Platypus Hoser 2L takes up a decent chunk of the room when filled. I also am not a fan of the way the bladder fits into the bag (goes between the main compartment and back support, no internal pocket in the main compartment which I prefer.) I really do like the Talon aside from the small-ish size and think that I want to stick with Osprey.

Obviously they make bigger sizes of the Talon bags and I was interested in the 33 or 36, but I also saw the Stratos line that has more cushion and venting and is available in similar sizes to the Talons I like (34 and 36) but many stores in my area including REI and some smaller local guys don’t have those packs for me to try out.

As the title states (vaguely), I want to know about the Vietnamese Single Entry Visa, specifically, what is to be done in the event that one must re-apply for the Visa in a short period of time.

To fill you in with the details: my girlfriend and I left Vietnam recently and soon realized that she has only a single entry visa. We re-applied and expected to hear back from the consulate within 3 working days; however, on further inspection, it would appear as though she might be waiting between 3-15 days, as she has recently invalidated her single entry Visa due to leaving the country. 

Until now, we believed that the process would merely start anew and we would only be waiting for 3 working days; however, as the above may well suggest, we are at a bit of a loss at this point! 

Essentially, how true is this? Our flight back, from Ho Chi Minh, is well within the 15 day window, and so, I’m just wondering what our options are.

Keeping your money safe while traveling takes some forethought and planning. The feeling of being in a strange and exciting new place can be a truly rewarding experience. If you are robbed or taken advantage of, it can give the words strange and exciting whole new meanings.

 There are many ways in which you could lessen the likelihood of such frustrating and scary things from happening. Money is essential when traveling. Keeping it safe isn’t as complicated as one might think.

 Through some simple tasks and diligence, you can make some very effective steps toward your protection and the safeguarding of your funds.

# Be careful who you deal with when you are traveling

Be careful who you deal with when you are traveling. Many tourist destinations are targeted by scammers, con-artists, and your average petty thieves. Being taken for your money never feels good. It can really turn a trip abroad into a much glummer affair. This doesn’t mean that you should avoid the local denizens, just be sure that you are mindful of your surroundings and most particularly any business that you might decide to do with them.

Thieves and con artists are fairly adept at spotting tourists. Different clothes, hairstyles, cameras, electronics, languages, and jewelry are all dead giveaways that one is not from the local area. They also know that you will likely be moving on within a few days or so. This gives them the advantage of knowing the local area and how to make themselves scarce. They also know that once you are gone, it increases their chances of getting away with their crimes. By not bringing attention to yourself, you can lessen your chances of being targeted. Taking a few preventative measures can really pay off. Don’t wear clothing that stands out. Seriously, fancy clothes can offer clues that you might be a tourist. Try to dress nicely but also try to take some measures to blend in and don’t flaunt your attire.

Carrying fancy mobile electronic devices like cellphones and cameras can also be a tip-off. Try to keep them out of sight and don’t keep them in day bags or purses. Try to keep them close to you and in a place that someone can’t pickpocket. Jewelry can also be a hint. Flaunting jewelry is like flying a white flag. It just surrenders your ability to blend in and it within itself is valuable. Even costume jewelry can be a tip-off. It often looks so similar to the real thing it may actually be a bigger liability because it tends to be larger and can draw more attention.

# Cash may be king but..

Cash may be king but you will be a pauper if you don’t keep it close. Carry your cash close to your body and maybe even **consider setting up an offshore savings account for easy access**. Having pockets sewn to the inside of your clothing can help a lot. Carrying money in your shoe may not be the most convenient or the safest but it’s better than in a gaping front pocket. Keep small amounts of money in several places on your person.

Carrying two bill folds or a money clip and a billfold could be a great idea to keep your money safe when traveling. If you are held up, you hand them the one with a few dollar bills in it instead of the one with more value. Throw some of those rewards cards that you never activated in the wallet or purse and some business cards and generic receipts from a store that you used in the past. Make sure that you do not have any identifying information in it. A dummy wallet can save your money and identity from a thief and it may even keep you relatively safe in an otherwise dangerous situation.

Use traveler's checks in small denominations that you have signed beforehand. Keep the receipts for them in case they disappear. Traveler's checks can be replaced if lost or stolen. You can generally reach the issuer's customer support around the clock all week long by phone. Dealing with stolen traveler's checks may slow you down but won’t leave you broke. Also, try to have your checks issued in the local currency for your convenience.

# make some copies of your documents

Before you leave, try to make some copies of your documents. This must be taken very seriously. Not only because you may need them but also be sure to safeguard them. In some cases, your copied information can be just as much of a liability as the real thing. That being said, take measures to protect all of your information.  
The hotel industry spends millions every year to make attempts to secure the rooms that guests rent. 

The fact is that most hotels have several employees running around day and night all week long with a master key or several. This isn’t to say that all hotels are filled with thieves but you can rest assured that if you leave no money in your hotel room, it won’t be stolen there. If you have valuables and money in your possession, take careful measures to safeguard them. If you are alone, bringing them into the bathroom when you shower is not overacting. Also, be careful who you let into your room when you travel. There are plenty of people that hang out in hotel lobbies and lounges that will be happy to spend time with you. Make sure to leave them there.

Safeguarding your credit cards physically works much like your cash. Keep them close and only use them when you know it’s safe. Make sure you set up an international bank account before you go but try not to use outdoor ATM’s/ABM and never hand your card to anyone that might be able to use a small handheld reader to steal your information or memorize your number. There are even some products that are sold that are supposed to help safeguard your credit cards from RFID readers.

Keeping your money safe while traveling isn’t rocket science. Some planning and thoughtful actions can save you a headache and keep you from getting stranded in a strange land with few people that can help you. Learning some of the local languages is also helpful. It’s hard to report anything if you can’t be understood it.

backpacking,"Hello,

I have a backpacking trip planned for the weekend and the forecast is not looking good. Temperatures will be 98 degrees with a heat index of 103-105 and the kicker is that humidity will be 66-80%. Thunderstorms are forecasted for both days which will be a welcome respite, however for the rest of the day it will likely be extremely muggy which is a definite downside.

I did a short test hike this past weekend and even at 91 and 66% humidity I was getting seriously concerned about heat exhaustion. I was adequately hydrated but nothing was evaporating off of me so I was steadily getting hotter and hotter. Stopping to take a break felt worse to me than continuing to move because at least when I was moving the air was flowing past me. When I was sitting still it legit felt worse so I just kept moving. I also drank 3L of water in 2 hours and 5.5 miles and didn't pee at all that day so I guess I sweated most of it out.

Nevertheless, it was not often 'the real deal' as it was mainly resorts that I stayed on with my family. My oldest brother is the most adventurous person I know, and recommended me to take a gap year and travel (as opposed to working only). I am asking this community, which I have joined (actually 5 mins ago), for some recommendations for regions, countries, places, to visit now that I have a gap year.

backpacking,"Our big trip for the year! Watch as we take on the famous Rae Lakes trail for 4 nights and 5 days of insane mishaps with incredible views. We left town in the afternoon of June 7th and headed 5.5 hours to SeKi NP and stayed at the Sentinel campground to attempt to get an early start the next morning after we picked up our backcountry permit. Bear canisters are a must in this park and I was pleasantly surprised when we were asked to show them to the ranger before he would hand over our permit, love the dedication in this park. It was absolutely STUNNING there.

The first day we hiked about 8 miles with about a 1800 ft elevation climb and camped about halfway between Middle and Upper Paradise Valley. It was an ass kicker of a day with intense elevation climb in exposed areas that the heat just beat down on us. Once we rolled into camp I immediately needed a power nap. The next morning we woke up early to find one of our buddies wasn’t feeling well so we opted for a shorter ""easier"" day instead of pushing to get to the lakes as planned. We hiked roughly 7 miles that day with a another 1800ft elevation climb to the Woods Creek crossing suspension bridge. Even though the bridge is incredibly safe, I still felt terrified as I made my way swaying several feet about the river below. We camped just over the bridge in a popular PCT rest area. I was thrilled to meet several PCT hikers with tanned skin and excited faces as they are making their journey to Canada, a dream I can only hope to attempt one day in my life. Lots were from out of country! Sadly though, we found many PCT younger hikers in ""cliques"" walking in huge groups, thrashing their sites, leaving garbage in the bear boxes, acting rude or judgmental to normal hikers, even defecating in a middle of a field with no care to hide behind something. Sad.

The third day we awoke to find our friend was pretty ill again so it was decided he would hang back at camp and rest for the day while two of us day hiked up to see Rae lakes, and let me tell you - we were so happy we did! It was about a 12 miles hike up and back to the lakes with a 2000ft elevation climb/decline. Once we made it back to camp our buddy was feeling MUCH better and we instantly felt bad he wasn’t able to join us. After waiting around all day he was eager to get a hike in and move camp! Holy crap I was already exhausted with aching feet; I don’t know why I agreed but we made the decision to start our journey back to the trailhead. We night hiked about 5.5-6 miles to a little campsite by the river between Castle Domes Meadow and the South Kings river crossing. All in all was about an 18 mile day with 2000ft elevation gain and 3000ft ft elevation decline, and man was I paying for it with my left foot. OUCH. The next day was pretty easy going about 5 miles, declining 1200ft. We found a lovely campsite to relax for the whole day and and rest my foot for one last night in the forest. The bugs were out in full force there but we enjoyed river bathing and watching hordes of butterflies flying around us. The last day we wrapped it up in the morning with a quick 6 mile trek down to Roads End trailhead declining the last 1600ft to the car.

backpacking,"Posting my experience here from a recent trip to Chile regarding the mobility pass. Unfortunately I didn't find a lot of up to date information before I left, so hopefully this post can help others.

I'll be the first to admit I did not do sufficient research before leaving. I read that quarantine was not required if fully vaccinated and didn't think much more of it until 2 days before when I logged on to do my health declaration. At that time, I also read about the mobility pass that is required in restaurants, museums, and flights, all of which I was planning to take.

I immediately applied for the pass through the website, on Wednesday June 29. By the time the flight took off, I had no response. When I landed, I went through customs, and was randomly selected for a PCR test. The tests are based on the last digit of your passport number, with 2 numbers being selected per day. The entire process was very efficient. Nobody asked for proof of my vaccine, and nobody said anything about quarantine.

Then, while in the van on the way to Santiago, I received an email, all in Spanish. This is what it said (translated through google translate):

&gt;QUARANTINE  
&gt;  
&gt;On 07/02/2022, a control was carried out on your Affidavit for Travelers Coming from Abroad of your Declaration No. \[My Declaration Number\].  
&gt;  
&gt;You meet the requirements to enter the country, however, by not presenting COVID-19 vaccine approval, you will not be able to access the Mobility Pass. This document is the one that allows you to participate in activities with the public, attend shops and/or closed venues.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you were tested upon arrival in Chile and are positive for COVID-19, you must complete a quarantine period of 0 days (0 hours), until 06:30 a.m. on 07/02/2022, at the following address: \[My AirBNB address\]  
&gt;  
&gt;All people who are in the declared address must quarantine for a period of 7 days, despite having their complete vaccination schedule, mobility pass enabled and a negative PCR.

I wasn't sure how to interpret this... I am vaccinated and I've applied for the mobility pass. The email said 0 days quarantine, and then 7 days quarantine. There is nothing on any website I read saying that quarantine is required. Surely if I need to quarantine, somebody will actually tell me. I was not sure what to do. I didn't want to violate any laws, but I do have proof of vaccination. I decided to ignore the email and carry around my vaccine card just in case.

Within a very short time it became clear that the mobility pass is the world's dumbest and worst enforced vaccine passport. Very few places asked to see it. For those that do, they have an app where they scan the QR code, but they readily accepted my CDC card as proof of vaccination instead. I also saw other foreigners use proof of vaccine from other countries which were accepted without question. 

I had two flights booked on Monday July 4 (2 days after arriving in Chile, and 5 days after applying for the mobility pass). I chose to take a PCR test for $25,000 just in case the airline asked to see proof of my mobility pass, as a PCR test is one of the exemptions. The test was very quick and efficient. I had results within 2 hours. LATAM asked to see my mobility pass / PCR test on the outbound flight, but not on the return flight.

The evening of July 4, I got my temporary mobility pass. And the next day my mobility pass was rejected, because ""the certificate does not show your name and date of birth"". I'm not sure if they can read, because the name and date of birth is printed very clearly on the certificate. So I resubmitted the request and finally I got my mobility pass on July 6. Unfortunately the feeling I had from this whole experience is that the government in Chile is not ready to welcome tourists back, even though the people certainly are.

People in Chile are definitely still taking covid seriously. Masks are worn everywhere indoors, and much of the time outdoors. You'll also see quite a few sanitizer stations in malls etc... However, almost everything is open and operating, and there are very few restrictions in moving around. 

For anyone considering going, I would say don't be scared off by the mobility pass bs, even if you haven't applied for it and your flight is imminent. I had a great time and would for sure go again!",Chile mobility pass experience July 2022,,helkohelko,,8,2022-07-18 01:23:52

The last time I went, the herd had bulls and moms with calves which really freaked me out and the time before that, one broke from the herd and followed me really closely.

He’s a nice guy overall but the problem is he is complete dead weight as far as planning, crisis management or just having any kind of initiative.  I always have to plan everything and he never pays attention to the details and ends up asking me hundreds of stupid questions about what we are doing.  It’s often the same questions multiple times.

Examples:  

We recently had a trip planned to Europe for a hiking trip.  I sent him detailed itineraries and a packing list.  But he would call me multiple times asking me where we were going and what he should take.  Every time I’d ask if he looked at anything I sent and he would say he received it but hadn’t read it yet.

While we were going through the airport security he kept asking me stuff like should he take his shoes off, what about his watch, can he just keep his change in his hands.  I told him to just do what he normally does each time he flies when I’m not around.

He never pays attention to when we are planning things with other people on a trip.  He will sit right at the table quiet while we are all discussing where to eat, what to see, route to take and so on.  Then when we start to do it, he acts all surprised and asks “so what are we doing?”

Sometimes I will get short with him and he will reply “well I wasn’t listening!” Yeah that’s the problem.

In addition to regular travel, we do backcountry hiking a lot and I feel concerned hiking with a partner that is so clueless.  He never studies the map beforehand and I know that if I get injured, he would be worthless for getting help.

It’s really like I am dragging a 15 yr old kid around instead of a man in his 40s.  I’ve made the decision to stop taking anymore trips with him anymore.  I just need to decide if I want to have a frank talk with him explaining why or if I am just gong to ghost him.

Ohio is a state with all 4 seasons including very cold frozen winter and humid hot summers and the garage of course is quite damp. despite this i don't see any mold on the sleeping bag (some on the exterior of the bag that the sleeping bag was stored in though). the draw string seems like it might break if i tried using it since it is very brittle and the north face tag is now brown instead of white and very old. but otherwise does it seem like the best way to restore the bag would be to gently soak it in a bath tub with down cleaner? I don't see a rip or a hole but there are a few feather like down pieces on the exterior of the bag. is that a problem? I'm not trying to winter camp in a bag this old, but i live in california so it would be great if i could use it as a 3 season bag (even though i think it was originally a winter bag 45 years ago).

backpacking," Hey everyone,

I'm flying into Eugene to spend three weeks in the PNW next month. Definitely have backpacking and peak scambling in mind. I'm really confused about all the permits, and need some clarification.

I haven't done any camping in years. I'm used to just taking a flight somewhere, renting a car, driving up to a trailhead, filling out a permit right there, then hiking in and camping wherever. However, it seems like I can't do that anymore? Outside of well-established campgrounds with toilets and picnic tables, I've never heard of having to pay online months in advance to ""reserve"" a permit. It seems like even if you're just going solo with a tent and some food, you need to actually buy a permit online months in advance as if you're paying for a concert or sporting event.

I don't get it. I have some distinct questions below that should help me understand better.

1. Is this the only way to camp now? Is it not possible to just pack 3 days of stuff, drive up to a trail, and fill out a permit?
2. How do I know which trails required one of these reservations, and which ones don't?
3. What happens if I miss the window to buy a reservation in advance? Is it impossible for me to hike in that area?
4. What the heck is a ""7 Days in Advance"" permit? Is it the same thing as the reservation but put on sale 7 days before the selected date?
5. Do I always have to camp at a designated site, or can I find a flat spot 500 feet off the trail and pitch my tent?
6. What if I somehow manage to buy one of these things, but can't print it out because I don't have access to a printer? Can I keep it on my phone to show a ranger?

Thanks a lot for reading and taking the time to help me out. Hope that I'm still able to get out there and enjoy the wilderness.",SO confused about permits...,,DisastrousSuit8951,,14,2022-07-15 17:54:16

When we would get to the stretch of road, where the ponies ran wild, whatever our age, it was exhilarating.  

We mostly stayed in self-catering cottages, apartments or houses and there are many still out there to be sourced. We’d load up the car with groceries, disposable barbecues, outdoor and indoor games and sometimes our pet hamster or chinchilla.

In the nineties, we had story tapes of Roald Dahl and Dick King-Smith classics and then, as technology improved, Gameboys, consoles, and portable DVD players to pass the time.   

Now my family is going to recreate some of those memorable trips, starting this summer. We have, of course, replaced the AA routes my mum used to download with Google Maps, and the kids now have tablets to listen to stories or play games.  We are headed for the New Forest, but if you’re still unsure of your own destination, there’s still time to book an amazing deal (I know. I’ve looked).

Cornwall and Devon have some of the best beaches in Britain. The food is varied and delicious. And the seafood… incredible.  If, like us, you want to self-cater some of the time, pack up those portable barbecues.

There are so many spectacular sights to see in that part of the world. The rugged landscapes at St Ives, Penzance and Padstow where you can catch a boat trip, swim or surf. Iconic places like St Michael's Mount, the Lost Gardens of Heligan, Minack Theatre, Land's End, Tintagel Castle and the Eden Project in Cornwall.  

If you are headed for Devon, the list is equally as impressive; Dartmoor National Park, Exeter, The Milky Way Adventure Park, Hartland Abbey &amp; Gardens… and more.

For our own trip, we have been very savvy about trawling the sites to see what we can do at the New Forest at very little cost.   
After all, we have to come back and pay the bills, and the squeeze is on. Groupon has excellent deals on places to eat and drink at your favourite family restaurants.

As long as you plan ahead, you should be able to find deals on absolutely everything you need. I even found this really cool browser extension on r/beermoneyuk that lets you save even more at all the top bargain sites like Groupon and Red Letter Days.

Here’s the link if you want to check it out, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/voxb63/slash_10_bonus_to_use_for_online_shopping/).

I’m looking forward to spending time with my family away from the hurly-burly of everyday life.  

With a bit of time and effort, there are so many bargains out there to make your pound go further. I hope this helps inspire you to go out there and make the most of the beauty here in the UK.

backpacking,"Hello fellow travellers!

I am starting my 1-year working holiday in Australia in about two months from now and I’m planning on buying a used car once I’m there. There is, however, one question that I just can’t seem to find any good answers to... maybe y’all can help me out :)

When transferring the rego from the seller to me, I have to declare an address. The problem is: **I don’t really have an address since I’m a backpacker who’s constantly changing location**... 

I’ve read about multiple solutions, but each comes with its own problem:

1. Some people apparently just give the address of their current hostel.  
*Problem*: If I do that, I obviously won’t receive any mail the registration authority sends me (rego renewal notices, potential speeding tickets etc.) once I leave that hostel.
2. Giving the address of a friend or relative who could forward me the mail  
*Problem*: Sadly that’s not possible for me since I don’t know anyone in Australia.
3. Services like the UltimateOz mail service, which would be a neat solution  
*Problem*: I’m not sure if the registration authority will accept such an address since it’s obviously not a residential address. On top of that, these services usually provide a Sydney address, but I’d like to buy and register my car in WA (if possible) since I’ve read that the rego is cheaper and easier to renew there.

The address also seems to be relevant for calculating prices for the rego (at least in some states, e.g. Victoria) as well as Third Party Property insurances, since it indicates where the vehicle is typically being garaged, but since I’m always gonna be on the move, that typical place doesn’t really exist.

**So, my question(s):** How did y’all solve this address problem? Which address did you declare and how did you manage potential mail?

I’d be really grateful if someone could tell me about their backpacker car purchasing experience in Australia!",Australia Working Holiday question - which address to declare when registering a car as a backpacker?,,AppropriateCow4,,3,2022-07-13 13:45:05

Having a hard time wrapping my head around how to pack lightly enough for SEA climate and fitting everything into a 45L bag, but then having sufficient clothes for when I go down to Aus later in the year (where it can get cooler, want some more home comforts as opposed to hostel living in SEA, etc).

I know this is a popular backpacking route for a lot of travellers so wondering how I should go about it.

I’m from Canada so shipping a suitcase down once I’m in Aus would be $$$. I was also thinking of buying clothes I need in Asia where I presume it’s cheaper than down under…

backpacking," Taking a break and exploring Lima’s surroundings on a short route is always a good idea. Very close to the capital, you can find several destinations await your visit, which you can enjoy as a couple, with friends, or with your family.  
Let yourself be startled by the fact that the **countryside** and the sea are only a short distance away.

There are several places where you can find absolute tranquillity, breathe different airs, and joy closer than you imagine.

Medieval castles, quiet beaches, hills full of greenery, archaeological complexes, historic ports, and picturesque towns are just some of the places where you can find absolute tranquillity, breathe different airs, and enjoy being closer than you imagine.  
Through these sites we share below, you can discover more about different fascinating places to visit very close to [**Lima**](https://terrasurtravels.com/destinations/lima/) and make your trip an **unforgettable experience**.  


**1. Chancay Castle**

This castle, which is located an hour and a half north of Lima in the city of Chancay, was built in the 1920s on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

It is one of the most popular attractions in the north. Thousands of travellers visit each year to explore the complex corridors, see the rooms, and learn about the almost 250 rooms that house pre-Inca art treasures and towers with a spectacular view of the coastline.

Live music and dancing, themed stories for children and the whole family, medieval-style shows, and public contests are available at the venue.

There is currently a hotel, restaurant, and swimming pool you can enjoy during your visit.

You can also visit the Municipal Museum of Chancay, where you can find prehistoric artefacts from the local culture and remnants from the Pacific War.

  
**2. Archaeological Sanctuary of Pachacámac**

It is made up of large pyramidal temples and buildings with ramps. For more than 1,500 years, it was a sacred place for various cultures, as it was consecrated to the most important god of the Peruvian coast, Pachacámac. He was said to be the creator of the universe and the force that animated all living beings.

Inside, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Moon or Acllahuasi stand out, both built during the heyday of the Incas. You can also see the famous oracle, capable of predicting the future according to legend, and which was a meeting point for many years for the Andean inhabitants who came to it to find answers to their questions.

&amp;#x200B;

In the place, there is also the Pachacámac Site Museum which shows the different pieces found in the area, such as ceramics and textiles, as well as the door of the idol chamber -a representation of the deity-.

**3. Antioquía**

Antioquia, located 70 kilometres southeast of Lima and around 3 hours distant, is one of the region’s most lovely and picturesque villages. Approximately a thousand people reside there.

The whole town is filled with white houses and embellished with pictures of angels, flowers, and animals in the style of the famous Ayacucho altarpieces.

The locals are passionate about growing apples, quinces, custard apples, and peaches, making jams, nectars, and vinegar to sell.  
**4. Azpitia**

Because of its breathtaking views of the Mala River Valley, Azpitia also goes by “The Sky Balcony.” A spot where you may take in the fresh air while also sampling the local cuisine.

Except during the closed season, the town features several eateries specialising in shrimp.

The town of Azpitia is well known for its wine and pisco production. So, when you visit this beautiful place, don’t forget to stop by one of its vineyards to learn more about these delicious beverages.  


**5. Callao**

Callao is Peru’s major port, with a plethora of sights to see. Among these is the Real Felipe Fortress, which was used to protect Lima during the Battle of May 2 and the Pacific War. The Naval Museum, which is housed aboard the Abtao submarine, is well worth a visit.

Walking through its streets, one can see several colonial and republican-style residences and balconies that are still in excellent shape, as well as its squares full of gardens. El Callao also welcomes you to explore its historic eateries and sample its exceptional sea gastronomy: a culinary feast for the senses.",5 places to visit from Lima,,terrasurtravels,,4,2022-07-12 18:05:52

backpacking,"Hi reddit! First-time backpacker here (26M) and trying to figure out a plan for a trip that I've half-booked. Would love to get some opinions and ideas from others.

This summer a bunch of awesome things are happening in Europe:

* One of my best friends from Indonesia who I haven't seen in years is getting married in Norway!
* My cousin living in the UK agreed to help me cross this [reddit meme road trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/c9qjcp/the_perfect_british_road_trip/) off my bucket list
* Another close friend will be in Barcelona for a study abroad program
* My old housemate who moved back to Germany invited me to stay with him and his gf

I work full-time but with flexible vacation days, so I'm taking 3 weeks off for the trip! Don't want to push it lol...

Here's the rough plan (**bolded** things are already booked):

Norway (7 days 7/26 - 8/1)

* 7/26: Arrive in **Bergen at 2.50pm**. Get gear &amp; head over to Odda (city near Trolltunga start point)
* 7/27: Hike Trolltunga all day (bucket list), then head back to Bergen. Crash with some other friends in town for the wedding.
* 7/28: Day at Bergen with said friends, then **fly to Alesund** and pick up **rental car**.
* 7/29: Drive to Trondheim via the Atlantic road (bucket list), then Inderoy for wedding
* 7/30-31: Wedding shit and free day afterwards
* 8/1: Go back to Alesund, return rental car, then **fly to the UK**!

UK (4 days 8/1-8/4)

* 8/1: **Arrive in London** in the evening, link up with cousin for awesome stupid roadtrip.
* 8/2: Bulk of driving from Shitterton to northernmost point of Scotland to catch the overnight ferry to the Shetland Islands
* 8/3: Drive off the ferry and arrive at Twatt, completing the roadtrip. Be stuck there for a day since, you know, overnight ferries.
* 8/4: Drive back down to cousin's home in Nottingham, then fly to Barcelona some time.

Spain/Alps/Germany (the rest of the trip. 8/4-8/12)

* This part of the trip is mostly in the air but I can crash with my Barcelona friend between 8/4-8/7, and my German friend in Nuremberg pretty much whenever.
* I'm thinking of doing Barcelona -&gt; Alps -&gt; Germany over those 8 days. But zero idea how much to allocate to each, nor how much structure I need to set/book ahead.
* I thought an overnight train would be a great/cool way to travel
* I would like to speed on the autobahn at some point if possible.
* **Fly out of Munich 8/12 5.25pm**

I've never actually done the hostel thing and really want to. But not sure how much time I should spend in one, or how far ahead I'd need to book it. Given how many things I have going on though, I'd be totally fine with saving the proper hostel experience for a future trip.

And that's it! Thanks for reading this far :)","26M, looking for opinions on a 3 week semi-structured backpacking trip plan across Western Europe!",,fenestra-inaequale,,0,2022-07-12 07:59:28

Before you say just go Osprey I just had their Aether Pro 85, but had to return it as the shoulder straps were god awful for me. Might go with Gregory if I cant find any experiences from Klattermusen, I think the postal service is starting to hate me returning so many backpacks lol!  


Sadly in my country as well there is like different brands for each store type of thing so I cant go to a physical one and try out all the major brands.   


2.6kg of the Ymer pack is kinda crazy but with 400D and the bone system it does not seem too bad.

backpacking,"Hi all, me and my wife are taking a short 3 month sabbatical to explore Central America and I was just wondering if anyone could guide us on rough ideas on mid to high range budgets?

We generally want to explore, go diving and take in as much of the culture as possible.

We’ll be getting buses to travel through each country.

I think a budget of around £200 / $250 a day in total for both of us sounds ok but I guess I just wanted some opinion of people who have potentially done something similar.

The blogs I’ve read seem to indicate this seems ok budget wise.

Also as another question has anyone travelled around Central America with a drone? I’ve got a sub 250g drone (DJI Mini 3 Pro) but our original plan was to fly into Mexico and then work our way down through Central America but I’ve just read drones are banned in Mexico for foreigners and I don’t particularly want to get it confiscated / get arrested.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

backpacking,"Wanted some opinions here. When going on backpacking (wilderness and such), I generally loan out my second choice gear or stuff I don’t mind getting messed up.

Examples for the summer: I’ll Loan out the neo air and I’ll use my uninsulated pad, even though I know that me and my companion both sleep hot. On a recent trip it was only going to 66deg at night and I used my synthetic quilt and gave my companion a poncho liner and silk liner. I know I’ll be very comfortable.

Small example would be me loaning out the single wall cup in the winter and me using my doublewall cup. Their coffee and hot chocolate will get cold fast.

It’s easy if my wife can’t join so the get her stuff mostly (except sleeping bags and packs cause those are sacred), but if we have a third joining the gear gets a bit janky (although it’s what I started off with, mostly).

Fortunately my wife has never guilted me - although she is fully kitted now- but I know I’ve been guilted a bit by past girlfriends and friends about it.

I guess the reason I care is that I don’t want to turn off a potential backpacking buddy over them feeling like they got the crap gear. My thinking generally has been that I have curated and take very good care of my gear and as such I get to make the decision.

As a final note I’m in my mid 30s and we all have some money now - it’s not like the broke college days.

With all the news about airline and train strikes in the UK, it makes me nervous to check my backpack, but I'm not sure it can be accepted as a carry-on. I have a 50L Ultralight pack pictured below.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan is to call the airline and get their advice, then possibly shipping my trekking poles and camping gear to my destination and just storing my clothes and basics in the pack for the flight to cut down on size.

What are your thoughts? Have folks brought big packs as carry-ons with Iceland Air?

Alternatively, any advice if I do decide to risk it and check the bag? What's been your experience with packing trekking poles and not having the pack get destroyed by the airline baggage system?

backpacking,"Magog booked July 10, 11, and Marvel Lake for July 9 and 12. Og Lake is available for July 9 if I wanted to swap.

Weather for that time period looks pretty much as good as you can get. Its a combination of Sunny, Mostly Cloudy, and Partly Cloudy days.

There are three ways into the park: via Sunshine Village, Assiniboine Pass, or Wonder pass. I've heard that Sunshine Village and Wonder pass are the most stunning.

The issue is the snow conditions. Due to current snow pack, the condition report ([https://assiniboinelodge.com/trail-report](https://assiniboinelodge.com/trail-report)) is saying that the route from Sunshine is pretty much a no-go, and Wonder pass doesn't look great either. That means hiking in and out through Assiniboine pass, with spending 2 days the core zone. I think we might be able to make it to Wonder Pass from the core zone, but not through it.

I'm trying to decide whether it's worth it or not to go. Originally I wanted to do Sunshine to Mount shark, but I think that is out.

Has anyone who has done the hike got any advice? I'm leaning towards going since we have good weather conditions. Any advice on side trips to take?

I’m going away in January/February with my girlfriend. We are both 19 y/o and Australian.

This is the itinerary I’ve been working on non-stop for the past week:

✈️🇻🇳Ho Chi Minh City | 2 nights
✈️🇰🇭Phnom Penh | 2 nights
🚐🇰🇭Kampot | 4 nights
🚐🇰🇭Sihanoukville
✈️🇹🇭Bangkok | 4 nights
✈️🇻🇳Da Nang
🚐🇻🇳Hoi An | 4 nights
🚐🇻🇳Da Nang
✈️🇻🇳Da Lat | 3 nights
🚐🇻🇳Lak Lake | 1 night
🚐🇻🇳Nha Trang | 4 nights

I’m hoping you all can read the way I have formatted it…
 
You may think the order of countries is a bit wacky (e.g. leaving and returning Vietnam), but I can assure you all this is the cheapest option so please do not worry about the logistics.

Am I making any major mistakes in terms of spending too long / too little time in a certain city / country?

I’d say that my main goal was to make this trip contain as much variety as possible, while still not rushing between places (although, I still might be slightly rushing within the time frame). 

Please, any and all advice, questions, etc. are welcomed and appreciated!

Is -2C comfort temperature really comfortable at +/-0 or should one add a few more degrees? Is there an actual difference between regular and women’s versions (besides length)?

- Rab Ascent Pro 600

backpacking,"I’ve never been able to get out of an 8+ mile hike without some back discomfort. I went on a 13.5 mile hike with about 4000 ft of elevation yesterday. Brought my 50L backpacking bag since I had lots of water, extra layers, and a big camera. I felt great for the first half but started having some back aches during the second. 

My bag was fitted by a couple employees at REI awhile ago so I don’t think the size is an issue. I’ve been playing sports and lifting for the last decade so it shouldn’t be from a weak core. I make sure I tighten the waist straps as much as I can to try to get all the weight on my hips, but I still can’t avoid back aches entirely. Any ideas?

I am 19 years old and am going with my girlfriend who is also 19 years old. We are both Australian. 

How many nights should we spend in each city?

I was thinking 4 nights Bangkok - 2 nights Phnom Penh? (in Jan/Feb)

We’re looking for exoticness, a potential culture shock, things to do (not really things to see), good food, safety, ease of travel, etc. We will previously have spent 3 nights in HCMC. 

Please note that we must spend nights in both of these cities.

backpacking,"I (27 M) just wanted to fill in the gaps regarding this hike as information on hiking Salkantay without a guide was sparse.

I just completed the 69 km (43 mi) trek from Challacancha to Machu Picchu over 5 days and 4 nights (last week of June during their dry and to what I have heard is their busiest season).

1) If you arrive at each location by 14:00 you will most certainly find lodging

1a) If you are still stressed about this or fear you will not arrive by 14:00 you can look up the destinations on google maps, click on the hostels, and text them via WhatsApp. I did this for a couple nights and used Google Translate to communicate in Spanish.

1b) I paid about 20 dollars for me alone each night and could have paid less if I wanted to barter or did not reserve in advance via WhatsApp (they didn't specify what that fee would be but I was paying more than others I spoke with that booked the night on the spot).

2) Do not worry about breakfast or dinner - Breakfast is included in hostel stay and Dinner is an extra 10-15 Soles (3.92 USD as of 4.7.22)

2a) I recommend bringing at least 1-2 energy/lunch bars for each day. There is plenty of fruit available along the way beginning in Chaullay (night 2). Some places will serve lunch for 10-15 Soles as well (also beginning in Chaullay).

3) I rank hike difficulty at moderate. Everyone says day 2 is the most difficult, my partner and I thought it was easiest behind the first day as the ascent is gradual. Days 3 and 4 are the most difficult as it is much hotter and you're naturally tired from the first 2-3 days.

\*\*\*\* I ran cross country in college so my endurance may be a bit better than average. However, this was my first thru-hike

4) Shoes - just make sure they are waterproof and comfortable, they don't need to be the new Lowe hiking boots, I did it in Hokas and saw everything from Nike Air Force 1s to mountaineering boots. Inserts in any shoe would serve you well.

5) A 40L pack is more than enough, just make sure it has hip straps too. I carried a 60L pack that contained everything (lunch bars, clothes, toiletries, rain jackets, jackets, backpack rain cover, water, water filtration device, book) for both my partner and me and it was plenty.

I wasn't trying to pinch pennies and ended up spending about 130 USD myself across the trek (including entrance fee to Machu Picchu)

\*In conclusion, trek can easily be done without a guide.

\-- Side note, while it is a personal choice in the end, my partner and I really enjoyed doing the trek without a guide. I will list why.

1) We had our own schedule which allowed us to pass every (not an exaggeration) group along the way. Many groups were frequently waiting for their slowest hiker to catch up.

2) It gave us a greater sense of accomplishment (again, very personal to each and this certainly doesn't matter to everyone, nor does it need to)

3) My partner works directly with animals and did not want to use a guide, which (all that I observed) use mules to shuttle the bags and supplies of the hikers from point to point (at least on days 2-3 -- it appears cars are used afterwards). You will see many horses and mules carrying large loads up and over Abra Salkantay (highest elevation of trek). Unfortunately, you may witness guides whipping these animals.

\- Some choose to do the trek with a company so that they do not have to carry as much weight, which I can understand; however, I will say that 60% of the guided hikers had a &gt;30L pack on. I was unable to figure out why that was..

4) Saving money. We spent 130 USD each (5 day/4 night), while the most popular guide you will see on the trek, Salkantay Trekking, charges 495 USD per person for their basic 5 days/4 nights option (695 USD per person for premium).

If you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer",Salkantay Trek Unguided,,chm---1,,0,2022-07-05 17:13:22

I'm new to backpacking and one thing I don't really see discussed at all here is where you all even find all these beautiful places to go backpacking!

backpacking,"Hi everyone, I have an opportunity to spend 2 nights in either Nice/Monaco or Budapest. I understand that the south of France and Budapest are completely different experiences but I am really unsure which one I would rather go to. 

I am a 21M and this will be my first time in Europe. Currently, my trip includes Barcelona, Rome, Florence, Venice and Paris and was looking for a 6th destination between visiting Barcelona and Rome (the way my tickets are structured I won't be able to visit nice after Paris which is at the end of my trip). 

On one hand Budapest would provide amazing architecture and cheap food and drinks and a great nightlife. On the other hand, I feel like exploring Monaco and the small villages around Nice will have a distinct charm that won't be replicated by any of the bigger cities I am visiting. The nightlife in the other cities I am visiting may not be up to par with Budapest but I'd still be doing plenty of it. 

I would be arriving on Monday morning and leaving Wednesday morning, which is also making me second guess Budapest a little.

I’m moving to Canada in a couple weeks from the UK for an IEC working holiday visa for two years. 


I’ll be in Toronto for a couple days in hostels then I’ll be doing farm work that I’ve secured via Workaway for bed/board for 25hrs a week for three months. I have ample savings but I’ll also be working part time freelance for about £1k gbp ($1557 CAD) a month after tax. From there I’m just going to try and figure it out.


I’ve got a large 64L backpacking bag that I will be using in lieu of a suitcase, I’ve packed clothes, comfortable undies, sports bras, socks, toiletries, two towels, one for hair one for body, and a laundry bag for dirty clothes. I have a hair brush, a butt tonne of hair ties, I have a baseball cap, sunglasses, one pair of trainers/sneakers, a pair of (broken in) doc martens I’ll be wearing on the plane and some hiking/work boots and thick socks. I have sun cream, bug spray, mosquito net if necessary, first aid kit, the cold/flu medicine I like, a sleeping bag liner and a pillow case in case the sheets at any hostels are nasty. I’ve got a thin raincoat, but also a stellar winter coat that also fits in my backpack. I have a scarf, gloves and a good winter hat. 


I have also got a regular backpack for my carry on. This has got my laptop, Bluetooth headphones, wired headphones, every kind of usb charger known to man, kindle, adapters etc. an (empty) hydro flask, pain killers, masks, antibacterial wipes, sanitiser, travel pillow and sleep mask, and a folder for all my visa documents, police certificates etc available for when I arrive at Toronto. 


I have also just bought two AirTags to put into both pieces of luggage due to the mayhem in Toronto with luggage at the moment.


Is there anything I’m missing? I’m going in July so I haven’t packed much in the way of winter clothing but I have packed a lot of layerable clothes and figured things like thermal wear or rain pants can be picked up out there, as well as any hiking gear should I need it.

backpacking,"Recently I wild camped on the side of England's highest mountain, Scafell Pike. I climbed via Eskdale Valley which is a much quieter route. I set off around 15:00pm and saw 4 other people. At about 20:00pm I set up camp on Pen which is just below the summit. The wind gusts were around 45mph through the night so I only managed about 3 hours sleep.

I climbed to the summit around 6am the next day and had it to myself for almost an hour before the crowds started to show up, which was amazing. The wind gusts at the top were around 60mph.

Fog and rain was predicted for later in the afternoon so I had hoped to climb a few more summits in the area before then. However, as is the unpredictable way with the mountains, the weather changed much earlier than forecast and visibility dropped to a few meters. the fog came in within 20 minutes and just proved how, if you're unprepared, you can get in serious trouble quickly. I was unfamiliar with the area so used my GPS to help navigate off the mountains.

This was an epic adventure and I loved every minute of it! Video below if anybody is interested.

I’m not too worried about that, as I can find information about the route online (but would of course appreciate any suggestions). What I’m struggling a bit more to find, is information about spending a few days in the Picos de Europa. I’m seeing there is a bus from Santander to Potes or Fuente Dé, which are sort of base towns from what I understand. From there, is it feasible to spend a few days hiking the park without access to a car?

We’d clean them up as best we could, but they’d still get dirty paw prints over the sleeping bags, managed to puncture a sleeping pad with their toe nails, and in general just made things dirtier and increased the amount of gear we had to patch/repair for this season. 

 One solution that worked okay was to carry an extra tent footprint/tarp/camping blanket and use it to cover the sleeping bags and have the dogs sleep on top of it, but those light nylon blankets/tarps are not at all breathable, so they trap a ton of condensation at night and the sleeping bags would often be really damp in the morning. 

How are people backpacking with dogs and handling this issue? Do you just accept the messiness/damage? Are my dogs just particularly destructive?

Edit: editing to add that the dogs aren’t super rowdy and start the night by sleeping in their spot at the foot of the tent.

backpacking,"Hi!

Me and my partner will travel to Ireland in August. We have never been, and don't really have any clue what to take into account when visiting the country. We want to keep to a semi-tight budget, and have one week to spend there. I've posed some of our questions, and feel free to add extra thoughts too that we haven't thought of! Perhaps we could get some ideas?

* What cities would you recommend?
* What are must see's in Ireland?
* What are must do's?
* Any recommended events during August?
* Do you have to book accomodation in advance, or can you do it a day or two before intended arrival?
* Would renting a car and staying at Airbnb's slightly outside of the city centres be a more economic choice than living in the ""downtown"" hostels but traveling without a car (we'd like to avoid dorms during this trip)?

backpacking,"Hi

I'll be travelling soon, on roads, in mountain, in forests, in the city. My solovair boots probably weight more than a kilo. And I feel like willing to try less sophisticated shoes, that'll let my feet di their work. Did you try backpacking with barefoot shoes ? 

The idea of barefoot shoes is that comon shoes usually replace your feet's natural abilities and therefore weaken them by making them useless. I like the sensation of barefoot shoes when used as daily shoes. But bearing a 10kg backpack isn't something that your feet are naturally made to do so I'm thinking that, maybe, in that case, that may be a bad idea. But I don't know. And I'm not especially asking for an opinion (unless there are podiatrists here) but rather a feedback. Did you try it ? How was it ?

backpacking,"I have been toying with the idea of replacing my current schoolbag with a hiking pack for 2 reasons:

1. I intend to, after uni, travel anyway and I need a pack, I don't particularly wanna get a second pack so my thought process is I want to get one I would use hiking and then just use that for everything
2. I find on just daily things like class, gym, and whatnot my everyday random Swiss gear backpack is ALWAYS packed full to the point I can often only get one change of clothing and a pair of gym shoes in it tightly, it's annoying to not have much more space.

Then also I'm getting a job that requires me to go on site for a week, which means there I need to pack clothes, I dont have a suitcase on me and find it a bit of a waste to get one for a shorter term job when I could get a 50-60L backpack to use in place of it, and then when it's over use said same backpack as an everyday pack for school to get used to using it before traveling with it as well (and if I can hike during summer or school time also do that)

So I'm curious because I don't see much online about it.
Has anyone ever used a full hiking pack as an everyday pack, ignoring that I've been told il kinda look like a Doof, I'm not worried about aesthetics too much.

What are your size recommendations (60 too large or 45 too small)?
Any specefic brands or makes that you think would fit (I know most by Osprey, Gregory and arkterax are good from what I've seen)
And if youve done this how did it feel to use a hiking pack as a general day pack? Was it comfortable, uncomfortable?
 I can assume most people would say ""too much space"" but I genuinely don't understand what the problem with MORE SPACE that's not used causes in everyday life in terms of a pack or is there an actual logistical reason for bigger not being better (also not buying a 100L obviously there's a TOO big but not sure why 50 would be)",Using a 50L as a everyday pack,,mrbobofancypants,,11,2022-06-28 11:27:46

I'm doing my best optimizing my Android phone's battery for a 50 days upcoming trip (my phone is a oneplus 7t pro btw). Just seeing if I missed some things and sharing my tips in case some need it :

 * I did a factory reset (that was maybe too much, anyway it can't be bad) 
 * Diminished the screen resolution
 * Diminished the refresh rate 
 * Diminished the brighteness 
 * Put my maps in offline mode
 * Disabled notification for almost all apps except the messaging ones and for cartography. 
 * Disabled google assistant. 
 * Used the basic ""optimize apps"" mode. (dont know what it does exactly)
 * Blocked notification form not needed apps

A part from the assistant I didn't look too much at Google services. Should I have a look ? If so what do I need to disable ? I would like to keep everything related to position if possible. 

Of course I'm planning to use airplane mode most of the times. Just with the GPS on.

My partner and I have about 16 days of travel to play with come July (we've left it super late). Originally we were thinking about heading to Colombia but have been looking more into Argentina. I rarely see posts about Argentina on this forum (I might be wrong). Type of trip we're looking for - good hiking, good food, decent nightlife, a couple of days spent on a beach would be a bonus. The budget isn't too much of an issue.

Bio - we are from Canada. We thoroughly enjoy the outdoors but have little experience with mountainous terrain.

We have a few questions.

We recognize that Argentina will be in their winter months in July - is it not worth the money, and the time getting to Argentina considering the colder weather?

Is the country relatively safe?

Did you use public transit, or rent a car?

The last concern I have is that we have not booked anything. We are hoping to camp out a few nights in one of the national parks, but from what I read you have to book sites well in advance. Is any truth to this? Considering our lack of experience, we would likely hire a travel guide.

Any reasons why, or why we should not travel to Argentina?

backpacking," Over the years, I've managed to fill up the garage and vex the women in my life by not ever throwing any camping gear away. In the late 1980s I started collecting Militaria and in the course of that I've bought items originally thought to be military that turned out to be camping gear that just looked military. I've long since sold or traded the Militaria but kept hold of the camping gear. My Grandfather was a long-time militaria collector and part of the advice I received from him was ""We buy this stuff to hold onto for the next guy and so we can talk about it. If we're lucky, we get to tell a story."" This advice, along with embarking on the Classic Camping Living History I talk about in this thread: [Classic Camping | Bushcraft USA Forums](https://bushcraftusa.com/forum/threads/classic-camping.331741/#post-6128684)  
has led me to create a playlist on my long dead YouTube channel talking about the History of Design and the development of camping gear of the 20th Century. Its going to be a big chore long in the doing as the plan is to go from about 1890 to 1989. To keep it smaller, I've decided to keep it general and not exhaustive. The series is intended to be an adjunct of the Classic Camping Living History and to help Old Gear collectors identify pieces and modern-day gear designers a working knowledge of the foundation of camping gear design.

I start with sleeping bags, then stoves and backpacks. So far, were in the late 1920s, early 1930s. Here's the first video in the series:

I am planning to start contract work next year so I could work for 3-6 months then take off 2 months between another contract and go abroad again.

I have a Sea to Summit Comfort Light sleeping pad which is comfortable down to about 32\*F / O\*C. Colder than this and my back starts to feel chilled.

backpacking,"Will have approximately 5-6 weeks off from the last week of March through the first week of May, and I have been just itching to spend that time hiking somewhere. Some background about me:

* **Based in TN, but open to going out west or really anywhere in or outside of the US**, I like trying new experiences. Only major constraint is the 5-6 week window from late March thru early May
* **Many hundred miles of backpacking &amp; hiking experience** \- have done a few hundred miles of AT (in smaller sections), some desert hiking in NM, and just got back from doing the Camino de Santiago. Admittedly don't have experience with ice axes or crampons though

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've considered the following trails:

* NOBO AT section hike from Springer
* Benton-McKaye
* Mountains-to-Sea (or, NOBO on the AT to Clingman's Dome and then east on the MTS for the rest)
* Ozark Trail / Ozark Highland Trail
* Arizona Trail
* PCT NOBO from Campo

The three I'm most considering right now are the AT, Ozark Trail and Arizona Trail - but I'm open to other suggestions! I'm just trying to figure out what options I have for such an early spring hike, because a lot of my ""bucket list"" hikes (Wind River, JMT, Colorado trail, etc) are better suited for later in the summer.

backpacking,"I've been to Vietnam in 2017 and in several hostels I saw that there is the opportunity to go on a multi-day motorcycle tour with a guide. He would bring his own motorcycle and one for you and together you would ride most of the day seeing great landscapes and for the night he would head for a local family for authentic food and sleep.

I didn't have a motorcycle license or riding experience that time, but now I do and I'm willing to do something like that. Does anyone know in which countries (South America or Asia preferred) this is possible or common? When I google for motorcycle tours in whatever country, I find group rides with hotel accommodation for 3000 EUR - 5000 EUR for 2 weeks which is not my way (and budget) of travel. Also, I'm hesitant to buy/rent a bike and go alone as I don't have any experience with repairs.

I want to mention that I would prefer motorcycle over scooters.

backpacking,"Dear friends, I’m going on a 6-months backpacking/low-cost travel and I’m very concerned about being light, comfortable and secure. I have backpacked before, but never carried a camera and a computer with me, which adds a lot of difficulties.

I am doing a Work and Holiday in Australia and then travelling through Southeast Asia, so my travel may be larger than 6 months. I need my camera for pleasure and my computer to work.

I would be very grateful if you could answer some of my questions☺️

1. How can I keep these devices safe from rain and dust in my backpack? Do you recommend bringing with me some kind of special bag?

2. How can I keep my bag light and comfortable? I suppose I will have to compensate the weight of the devices by bringing less clothes, what other tips do you recommend?

3. Do I have to worry about getting my camera or computer stolen in backpackers hostels? I guess yes. I’ve thought about contracting an insurance, but it may be very expensive for six months… maybe you can tell me other ways of increasing the security of my devices?

4. Do you have any other tips about travelling with these electronic devices?

I've noticed that even the animals hear me coming miles away because of the noise. Also, I make hiking videos for YouTube. I have to stop to talk to the camera every time. On shots of me walking the creaky sound is often overpowering the natural ambience. Might not be a big of a deal for many, but it is for me.

I'm looking into getting a new backpack with similar features, but I could go size up into the 70l category. Is the Aether AG as noisy? Other Osprey's worthy of mentioning? I'm not gonna easily ditch Osprey, but if you have killer recommendation I would appreciate them as well!

I'm doing mostly week long +100km hikes these days in the challenging environment called the Nordics.

backpacking,"First of all I'm going on a solo trip towards the Austrian and Swiss Alps, and I bought this backpack to be my companion. The trip will be focused on camping sites, maybe one or two nights of wild camping and taking the car. Also I'll take my photography gear with me because it's a bucket list for me to be able to photograph in the Alps. Anyway let's start with my overview of the bag and myself. 

 I'm someone who likes to travel, not got many needs and likes to keep things failry simple. As long as I've got a place to sleep, eat and maybe shower. So lately I've been searching for a backpack that is organized and makes traveling easier. I came across Tropicfeel as a brand a while ago and thought about ordering their other backpack, the Shell. However reviews were all over the place and it had some flaws that kept me from buying. Then the Hive backpack was announced, and it got almost all the features I was looking for in a backpack so I pre-ordered 1. You can see [how it looks here!](https://i.imgur.com/Gqyex5W.jpg)

I'd like to show you guys everything the bag can do, and give you a detailed overview of the features because I know not everyone in this sub likes Tropicfeel as a brand (expensive, new, gimmicky) and you don't see much out there in terms of reviews. So that's why I'm going to try and give an unbiased review, which can maybe help you on your bag of choice and a buying decision. Of course this is not sponsored or whatsoever. Anyway, let's start!

I ordered the Hive with the following accesoiries: **the wardrobe**, the **toiletry bag attachment**, **12L smart packing cube** and the **camera cube** from the Shell backpack. [You can see everything here](https://i.imgur.com/cNGlwXr.jpg). Price I paid was €329,- which is quite expensive. The bag itself is €179 as of right now. This is probably the main reason people easily give other brands a recommendation because you pay a lot. If you already have packing cubes, attachments etc this is not the bag for you maybe but for someone like me I thought it'd be easier to buy everything at once.

**Wardrobe system and camera cube**

I'll start with the wardrobe and the camera cube. I configured it so the cube could fit inside of the wardrobe, [looking like this.](https://i.imgur.com/YD9lZHc.jpg) The camera cube can fit all my daily photography stuff I need to take with me. A Canon RP with adapter, a 24-105mm lens, a DJI Mini 2 drone and batteries/attachments. [It looks like this.](https://i.imgur.com/BmZKNK8.jpg) The cool (and for some gimmicky) feature about the wardrobe is that it can be compressed to fit inside the bag. You'll see that [in this image.](https://i.imgur.com/uK6bJju.jpg) The wardrobe in this picture holds 6 underwear, 8 pair of socks, a towel, long pants, 4 T-shirts and the camera cube. You can quite easily fit a lot more. Without the camera cube I'm able to fit 5 long pants, 6 T-shirts, 1 sweater, 1 or 2 towels and 8 pieces of underwear. One of the reasons I bought this backpack is that you can use the inside for [camping gear](https://i.imgur.com/QsvLU3a.jpg) while keeping clothes in the 12L packing cube on the outside. I'll come to that later. To fit the wardrobe, the backpack has an [expanding zipper](https://i.imgur.com/use1gwf.jpg) and looks[like this](https://i.imgur.com/mMuZm2D.jpg) once packed. [Here you see how the bag looks when expanded](https://i.imgur.com/YR0h6Wa.jpg).

**12L packing cube accesorry.**

Back to the 12L packing cube. This is one of the coolest features for me because it allows me to pack clothing for like a weekend or a small trip without compromising space in the backpack itself. If you try hard enough, you can probably pack 1 piece of pants, 2 T-shirts, 1 shorts, a sweater and underwear + socks for a small 4 day trip (depends how much you wanna/need to wear). [In this picture](https://i.imgur.com/0Pj4ieR.jpg) you can see how I packed mine for this example. It contains 2 T-shirts, 4 pieces of underwear, 6 socks and 2 long pants. It's called a ''smart'' packing cube because it has a compression zipper, making it fit in the backpack [seeing here.](https://i.imgur.com/3JIwK8k.jpg) The bag has a ''spider net'' system which you can use to store things for quick acces like food, drinks, or a helmet. I have to say it's quite a hassle to properly attach but once you've got the hang of it it's very useful.

**Toiletry bag attachment**

Next up, the toiletry bag. This is either a gimmick or a really useful feature. It's got magnets which lock onto your bag and won't come off until you pull the orange levers. Quite a cool design and worked well for me. For me the fact that it's seperate from the bag makes it really usefull. [I got all my toilettries in there without issues.](https://i.imgur.com/nHt94jz.jpg) The bag will look [like this](https://i.imgur.com/mOEEbLB.jpg) when it's attached.

**Removable wait strap/bumbag**

For me one of the coolest thing of this bag is the [removable bumbag.](https://i.imgur.com/Wpowg6l.jpg) If you would like to go out for dinner, or just hike without much with you it comes in handy. And when you need a waist strap you can easily slide it in. It fits your phone, wallet, airpods and maybe some cash. Not the most comfortable waist strap I've had on a bag but it works.

**Other features of the bag**

First of all there's the [''secret pocket''](https://i.imgur.com/mgw5E1B.jpg). It's perfect for airports to quickly store your pasport and boarding pass, or just to keep money or other important stuff.

There's also a water [bottle holder](https://i.imgur.com/qrUBRjl.jpg), which I'm the least fan of. It's very tight and barely fits a 500ML bottle. In my opinion they should've made it a bit more expandable. It works but could be better. Above the bottle holder you've got an elastic strap wit a G-hook. On the other side you've got 2 non elastic straps to hold things like a tripod (that's what I'm gonna use it for). On the top you've got a small zippered compartment. It's not big but things like aispods, keys (no key-hook unfortunately) and other small things will fit in there. The bag [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/QDRGUQV.jpg) when you (almost) have everything in place. Lastly you have the so-called ''kangaroo pocket''. This is a very handy pocket which is hidden [underneath the bag.](https://i.imgur.com/xV5D69P.jpg) When expanded you can place dirty things like a wet towel and wet/dirty shoes in there to keep them seperated from the inside of the bag. I've got size EU 45 and [they fit quite nicely in there.](https://i.imgur.com/0yV7uJm.jpg) At last the bag has got some inner mesh pockets. Two against the rear and 3 under the laptop compartment. This way you can keep and organize chargers, cables and other stuff.

Now finally the bag is all [set and done](https://i.imgur.com/P74k5K7.jpg). It's airline complient I believe so not much to worry about there. It can get heavy once fully packed. The wardrobe alone is already a bit heavy, although I reather have it sturdy and heavy than really loosely.

**Verdict**

The bag isn't as comfortable as my Lowepro Trek BP 350AW but that's also way less heavy when fully packed. It's fine in terms of comfortability but don't expect it to be superb. Quality of the materials are surprisingly good and I feel like they're gonna last. Although we'll have to see that first. I love the versatility of the bag. It's literally all I need to take, wether I want to go camping, doing a city trip or going away for months.

I have never ever written a story this long, so if you read all the way I'd like to thank you. I'm sharing it because I think people that are looking into this bag or brand need some more information, especially if they are prepared to pay such a hefty price for it. At least I would like to be more informed when doing such a purchase.

If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out to me :). Thanks!

**TLDR; I actually really like the bag. Not an experienced 'onebagger' so there's probably plenty of other options but the bag gives me great versatility, feels rugged, good quality and I dig the looks. Accesorries work great as well. I've made a headliner for every feature to easily find what you're looking for.**",Wanted to share my in-depth review of my new travel backpack and how I'm going to use it on my upcoming trip.

backpacking,"external frame attachment reccomendations for back pain?

Hiya! I'm disabled and experience a lot of back pain, and have worked really hard to improve mobility in the last few years. I've gone from needing a wheelchair full time to the occasional use of a cane and beginning to hike with my husband to improve my joint strength. Thing is, I'm going on a trip to study abroad next spring and it's going to be several weeks of intermittent backpacking. I have a really good backpack from when I was homeless as a teenager that I modified to suit all my needs, and I'd prefer to keep using it. It doesn't have a frame, and my chiropractor and physical therapist reccomended I get one to attach to it for support to reduce back pain and balance the weight, so I'm looking for one, but I'm kind of lost as to what exactly I should be looking for or what would give me the best support. I'd love any reccomendations y'all have or info as to what I should be searching for to attach to my existing backpack. I'd also love reccomendations for affordable pairs of trekking poles that can bear a decent amount of weight and height.
Also for reference I'm 6'2"" and have about average proportions, kind of wide hips for waist straps. Thanks!!",external frame attachment reccomendations for back pain?,,slutlore,,3,2022-06-22 22:12:43

backpacking,"Hi! I've never backpacked before and I roughly estimate I will be able to backpack in 2 years time. So I have some time to save up. In general I read that on average for 1 person they needed around ~€40K for a year worth of backpacking. Though I only plan to go for 6 months with 2 people total, would a rough €20K be sufficient then? Its just that inflation is getting up so crazy, I would probably need more with today's costs then?

I know it's highly depended on where you travel and how you travel (hotels compared to hostels etc). So I wanted to know what a rough average might be realistic and best way to calculate it. 

I found this calculator that seems helpful, but I don't know if that is entirely realistic:

Day 1 we started at the reservoir and headed towards Wapama Falls, from there out to Racheria Falls, and ended with an uphill trek to TilTill Valley ~12 miles, saw a bear before setting up camp.
Day 2 was mostly climbing up and around Mt Gipson then down to Lake Vernon ~9 miles.
Day 3 set a nice easy pace to Laurel Lake, only ~6 miles, had some thunderheads roll in and give us quite the thunder show but only had a few drops of rain.
Day 4 basically was all downhill so we cruised back to the reservoir pretty quick ~8 miles, saw a baby bear on the descent.

backpacking,"Hi All,

I recently quit my job and was planning on taking a year out and travelling to South America and South-East Asia. However, due to changes in circumstances, I will have to be back by November; thus, this will limit me to the countries/continent I can travel to.

I will start travelling in July-Oct (4 months) and contemplating where to go? SE Asia or South America?

Countries I will visit if I go to South America:

Colombia - 1 month

Ecuador - 2 weeks

Bolivia - 2 weeks

Peru - 3 weeks

Brazil - 5 weeks

Countries I will visit if I go to SE Asia:

Vietnam - 1 month

Laos - 2 weeks

Cambodia - 2 weeks

Philippines - 1 month

Indonesia - 1 month

I really wanted to travel to India but I believe it's going to be super hot and humid then so will have to skip it this time!

I would really appreciate any tips/recommendations on which of these two continents is better to visit? Or if you think I should visit/see other countries instead?

Thank you,",South East Asia VS South America,,daredevil2400,,10,2022-06-20 22:45:24

backpacking,"My girlfriend and I are planning a trip to the Philippines and want to travel around Bohol for a few days.

How easy is it to do without renting a scooter? I always hear it's the best way to travel around to is with your own scooter because it's cheaper and you have the freedom to go wherever you want but is it possible to just get tricycles to most of the waterfalls etc?
Also when you are finished at the sights will there be tricycles waiting to collect people from the waterfalls and other attractions? 

The main reason for not wanting to rent our own scooter is the risk of an accident, better to be safe than sorry even if that means spending a little bit more for tricycles everywhere, unless tricycles are crazy expensive or just won't collect you from the waterfalls.

Anyway any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated from people who have either done this before or seen other people do it this way.",backpacking around Bohol Philippines without renting a scooter?,,ScreamsTheWildGhost,,1,2022-06-20 21:34:42

The plan is to fly to Buenos Aires and do a small trip around Buenos Aires (Maybe see Iguazu, go to Montevideo or see the cities up the Rio Parana). Then fly to Ushuaia and see Tiera del Fuego. Thereafter I will go north along the Andes and visit national parks like Torres del Paine, Fitz Roy, Perito Moreno etc. It will be there were I will do the most hiking. After the National parks  I will combine cities and nature more. In the atacama I plan to do some hikes but not a multi day trekking. If I have the time I would like to hike up Machu Pichu.

We do have some experience backbacking from last august where we went through Sweden for 3 Weeks with an Interrail Ticket (for those who don't know: Train ticket over 1-3 months and a certain amount of travel days where you can take unlimited train rides through the whole EU and cooperating countries like Switzerland, Sweden, Norway that aren't really in the EU but kind of) and visited some cities and national parks.

We are doing another travel before starting to study/university or however you call education after 12 years of school. We were in south France for a few days hoping from city to city, are now in Spain visiting family and seeing some places and in two weeks we'll go up to Norway  for 3-4 Weeks to be more in national parks and in the wild than last August in Sweden and need a Pan to be able to cook better as right now we only have a small pot we make soups, noodles etc inside.

Should I just take the easy option: a small and light one from a supermarket

I hope you can help me, give some ideas and/or inspiration and help us decide. Maybe I am at the wrong sub, but okay. 

In July and August my wife and I are flying to Bangkok. We have 5 weeks and are planning to spend the last 2 to 2,5 weeks on Bali. We’re flying on Bangkok because the flight times are better and the tickets were cheaper. Any way my wife and I can’t decide how to spend the first 2,5 weeks. For now we made 3 itineraries:
- Northern Thailand; Mae Hong Son Loop;
- Southern Thailand and Malaysia; Koh Samui/Phangan and Kuala Lumpur;
- Cambodia and Vietnam; Cambodia and HCMC.

In 2013 I’ve traveled in SE Asia and went to Vietnam and Malaysia. I loved HCMC and KL. 

In 2016 my wife and I were planning to travel from Chiang Rai to Chiang Mai. Only to discover I lost my passport, drivers license and credit card.

backpacking,"I have a few days off in the next week or two and was originally planning on doing the Three Sisters loop (or some variation, maybe a figure 8 around Broken Top/South Sister), but after calling the local ranger station the snow levels aren't really cooperating (patchy snow at 5200', deep snow at 6000'). I didn't feel like dealing with that so I'm trying to find an alternative.

I've done the Three Sisters loop before and really enjoyed hiking all the way around a mountain/s, so the Timberline Trail (a loop around Mt. Hood) stood out as a good alternative. The other option was PCT OR Section G (Timberline Lodge to Cascade Locks), which would also be a cool trip. I'm an experienced backpacker and have hiked all around those areas for years, and was really looking for a longer trip and those seem to fit the bills (\~50 miles or so).

backpacking,"Hi Everyone,

I need some guidance from those who have travelled through Sumatra. My girlfriend and I are planning a 6 month trip to SE Asia. In September, we will be flying into the Philippines. After a month there, will make our way to Bali via plane. From there on out, we ideally will won't board another plane until the end of our trip.

For some reason, I was under the impression that many people that have travelled though Indonesia, do so by land and sea. After looking into it more, the days of the hippie trail through Sumatra are mainly lost because budget flights make more sense for a lot of people. We still, however, want to make our way from Bali to Singapore/Malaysia by land and sea only.

For people who have done this, what is the best route from South Sumatra to Dumai (where the ferry to Singapore departs). I have heard that South Sumatra is unremarkable so is it best to take an overnight bus somewhere right away? We plan to spend about 2 weeks on this island. We are also going to be aiming for about $1000 of spending money between us for this time frame.

I am aware that this is not a very well travelled area and we are prepared to be the only tourists for miles. I believe that after a month in the Philippines, we will have some grasp on what we are doing.

backpacking,"[Coast &amp; Wildcat Loop Point Reyes](https://youtu.be/hl4SHOkci98)

I was so excited to do this trip out to Point Reyes on February 11th-14th, 2022! We didn’t get to the trailhead until dusk on Friday evening and set out for a 6 mile night hike resulting in a 1,000’ elevation gain up Mt Wittenberg, and climb all the way back down to Coast camp for the night. The moon was almost full and at parts of the trail we didn’t even need headlamps, it was amazing seeing the stars above us while hiking.

The next day we gathered up camp and began the 8 mile journey to Wildcat camp, only an 800’ elevation change that day but the hills were steep and it was pretty exposed which made it hot. When we got to Wildcat camp, we got to see some Tule elk grazing on the hill over camp! I was really excited because I was hoping I’d get a chance to see them on this trip! 
Once we found our camp spot, set our gear down, and explored our area we decided to hike the 2 miles there and back to Alamere falls on the beach during sunrise. This was absolutely my favorite part of the trip..

The third day we were moving a little slow from the day before and took a while to pack up camp. It was about a 6.5 mile hike back to the car which would complete the loop. (~22 miles). Much to our surprise it was mostly shaded compared to the day before, making it a pretty easy hike back. We decided to check out the visitor’s center and the Iverness shipwreck when we got to the car before making the long drive home.

Initially, this hike was set to be in January but then part of our crew and I caught Covid and the group trip had to be canceled. Once I was back on my feet I was eager to get back on the trail! Unfortunately this meant that the full crew wouldn’t be able to make this trip, but we have a second trip planned! Keep an eye out for the next video.

backpacking,"Did a four day backpacking trip in the White Clouds Wilderness a couple years ago. This lesser known mountain range is actually really close (just East) of the much more popular Sawtooths Wilderness near Stanley Idaho. I started at the Fourth of July Trailhead and spent three nights in some pretty remote places, crossing four passes most of which were off-trail. Castle Peak is the center piece of the trek, dominating most views. Alpine lakes abound. Great camping is nearly everywhere. This section was fairly dry, but most of the trail has plentiful water sources.

backpacking,"I have a permit for a national park this summer but due to some scheduling issues I'm looking into changing the permit to cut the trip in half from a week to 3 days.  The catch is that the second half of the trip was the crown jewel part of it and I haven't found a permit yet that would let me start in the middle of the loop that I planned.

Cut to a conversation with a friend where I was explaining this and my frustration that there's a shuttle that goes right by the mid-point of the loop but no available permits that start at the trailhead at that mid-point.  The friend asked why I couldn't just start at the mid-point on the day when I would have reached there anyway, I explained that it doesn't work like that and they issue permits based on your start date and trailhead to ensure places don't get overly crowded and that I could get fined if caught starting at a different trailhead.  

But when pressed by this friend on why it would be a problem from an ecological perspective to start from that mid-point on the day I'd be there anyway after having skipped the first half of the hike, I didn't have a good answer.  The case was made that technically I was having less of an impact by only doing half the trip which would easily cancel out any negative effect of starting from a different trailhead.

So I'm putting that question to the community because I think there is probably a good answer that hasn't occurred to me, and that answer would be useful to dissuade me from taking this friend's advice and risking getting a fine lol.",Is deviating from your permitted route always an ecological negative?,,sdrotho,,6,2022-06-15 03:15:44

Hi fellas 👋

I have a few questions considering the visa requirement and frontier passing to Jordan as I plan to visit In August 2022.

First, I’ve read on the internet that Jordan is visa-free for Tunisian citizen but require a visa for Canadians, As I’m a citizen of both countries I assume that I can get there without a visa just with my  Tunisian passport?

I’m also planning to visit Lebanon and travel by bus through Syria to Jordan,  then I want to know if the Syrian-Jordan frontier would be open for foreign people? In Case I need a visa, would it be possible to get the visa directly in the frontier?

Also,  I read on the internet that the Jordan pass can In some cases replace the visa, will it be possible to get a Jordan pass as a multiple entry visa as I plan to visit Jerusalem for 2 days while I’m in Amman? If not, then would I need a multiple entry visa for being able to enter Jordan then visit Jerusalem, and get back to Jordan again?

And finally, the last question is about getting to Egypt from Aqaba, I know there’s a ferry that goes to the south Sinai Peninsula, but as you may know better what will be the best options to go to Egypt? Flight or ferry?

Thank you very much for your reply, All my greetings,

I hope my question fits this sub. It’s been a while since I backpacked with a real backpack in scouts, but we got a Poco Plus to hike with our 33lb toddler harnessed in and it’s great so far except I have some pain on the top of my shoulder (along my traps) after a few miles.

My hip strap is nice and tight and my load lifter straps are cinched all the way in. The shoulder straps themselves are pretty much as tight as can be so that everything feels quite solid.

I’m not really sure what my sternum strap should feel like or where the bag should sit on my torso (it’s adjustable, but I’m probably at the max height at around 6’5”)

Looking for any advice that could help me diagnose the traps/some neck pain during our hikes. The rest of my back feels great. Just pain up top.

backpacking,"Hello!

Myself (22M) and my brother (19M) are about to head off to Europe next week for our first ever inter-continental trip. We have round trip flights booked out of London and are using a Eurail Pass to get between cities. We are travelling on the cheaper side of things (hostels and backpacks), but are still wanting to see all the things we can in our trip. All in all, we have about $80-100 USD planned per day, with about $30-50 of that going towards hostels (they are kinda hella expensive right now). 

I am well aware this is going to be a chaotic and busy trip, but I see this as a taster for what Europe has to offer, doing some of the key touristy things in each city we visit, even if it not a long visit. Below is the itinerary I have concocted, but am looking for any advice whether it is trimming, adding, or altering what I have planned out below. 

**Planning**

**Wednesday, June 22** \- Land in London, Gatwick 10:00am

* London (3 days, including arrival day)
   * Recover from jetlag/roam Central London

* Heidelberg (2 full days)
   * Relax some/Enjoy Old Town
   * Check out Palace (Pharmacy Museum)
   * Philosopher’s Walk

**Tuesday, July 5** \- Heidelberg to Stuttgart (Day Trip) to Luzern

* Stuttgart - Wander city/chill in parks
* Luzern (2 full days)
   * Mount Pilatus tour (expensive, but heard it's worth it)
   * Ferry ride in the lake?

**MISC** \- Best train to go through/see the Alps on Eurail Pass? Either to Lugano or round-trip back to Luzern?

**Friday, July 8** \- Luzern to Lugano (Day Trip) to Milan

* Lugano - Mount Bre tour (cheap, nice, few hours)? Wander some.
* Milan (1.5 days)
   * Relax some, wander malls and streets (parks, ruins, etc.)
   * Castello Sforzesco

**Sunday, July 10** \- Milan to Levanto

* Levanto (1.5 days)

* Pisa - tower and wander
* Rome (2 full days) (I know it’s not enough time…)
   * Catacombs
   * Colosseum + Roman Forum + Palatine Hill
   * Vatican?
   * St. Peter’s Basilica/Castle

As well as to at least try to enjoy the beauty, food and culture, and have some good conversations with the locals and understand what their lives and are like.

However, as the day approaches, and I have prepared and overprepared and over-overprepatrd, I'm starting to get anxious about all the things that could go wrong. What if I packed the wrong clothes? What if I struggle to dry my clothes in Ireland? What if I miss a bus? What if I get sick? What if I can't handle 2 months on the road? What if what if what if?

Nonetheless, I won't be able to live with myself if I back out of yet another challenge. I want to stop being ruled by my fears.

On top of that I'm best man for a friends wedding, 3 weeks after I return from my trip. So on top of all the travel anxiety I'm stuck with organising a bachelor party which is a stress I really didn't want to have to deal with while on my trip. But at the same time, he's my best mate who means a lot to me, and I will certainly not back out of that either.","As the day approaches I'm getting damn scared, anxious, doubtful",,k2900,,13,2022-06-14 11:29:17

I've been staying in hotels for **5 to 6** years and  was upset for spending the Hotels before I have gone. .you know that it is very comfortable and fun to have a holiday in Turkey because it is cheaper than Germany. , The name of the hotel, which makes me really satisfied, is **Mivara Luxury Resort**The fact that it is a very peaceful, fun and delicious food place, including the spa, caught my attention.If anyone is going to Turkey or living, ıt should definitely stay for at least one day before she dies.

Experience: did a couple trips w Globeaware and it was incredible… however not looking for voluntourism… I won’t be a tourist but rather residing… not looking for pay to help. Not looking for an income though that would be sick haha.

backpacking,"Hey all, maybe this isn’t the right place and there’s a better subreddit - if so just let me know and I’ll move over there.

I’m planning my first ever backpacking trip and I’m planning to go to Iceland. I’m looking at a timeline of early to mid September. I’m going to give a little background about myself and also my budget: I’m 26 years old and in pretty decent health - I broke my back in March on a work related incident but am expecting to be back to 100% by the time this trip takes place. I’m military and am used to moving long distances with a lot of weight on my back and don’t expect any serious issues in regards to terrain or weather. While I’m not looking to spend it all and in all honesty am trying to do this without overspending, I should have about $10,000 saved up for the trip after saving for a long while - I have enough AMEX points to pay for a round trip ticket and be able to stay in hotels the entire time if I really needed. 

Again I have never backpacked outside of the military other than a handful of 2-3 day trips on long weekends. I am really looking for advice on where to go in Iceland and how to plan to get there to do whatever it is I should be doing. Of course I’m sure everyone has seen the amazing and incredible views on Instagram views and reels and I would just like to experience that in my life. I am tentatively planning for 12-14 days in country at the moment. I am working on being a friend or two out there who seem interested - but I may end up solo if it comes to that. I honestly have no idea what questions I should be asking, or where/what I should be planning. I could really use some help or advice specifically on locations/places. I am looking to spend a day or two in Reykjavic to get a taste of the culture and head out for the rest of it.

* **What do you do for water?**
* Is it safe for women? It doesn't look like there's many people at all on it, which both makes it safer for women and at the same time, makes it more dangerous because I'd be alone.

backpacking,"We're going to be in Indonesia in July and had hoped to visit Labuan Bajo and Komodo National Park from Bali.  There are two problems though: I can see that flights are getting booked and I am unable to book a flight from Canada. All the domestic airlines seem to decline my Canadian credit card, I believe this is not uncommon. I also tried booking through an online Indonesian travel company, nusatrip, but that also did not work. In fact, it was worse than did not work, but that's another story. Because I see flights filling up, I'm not optimistic about getting a flight once we are in Indonesia.

I don't quite get how people get this done. I would assume that many backpackers to Indonesia are there for only 30 days, similar to us. How do people get domestic flights booked ahead of time?",Booking domestic flight to Labuan Bajo? (Indonesia),,dougshmish,,9,2022-06-12 05:30:24

We currently carry an old tent that weighs about 6.5 lbs which is a lot of extra weight when backpacking. I've been looking at some smaller 1-person tents that weigh around 3 lbs just to save some weight. Does anyone have any recommendations or know of a great lightweight tent for dogs?

backpacking,"**Sandakan to Kota Kinabalu - The Long Way Round Sabah on a Scooter in One Day**

My father and I decided to make an adventure of our time in Borneo by renting a couple of 125cc scooters and taking the Eastern way around Sabah. The day before our journey we did a quick prep session and noticed that not many people have done this, especially not in one day.

We discovered that there weren’t many resources available online warning us of what to expect or to prepare for this specific trip so I have written down some highlights and tips from our own experience which may be helpful in case you would like to take on this adventure yourself.

**DISCLAIMER:** this is not an easy one day cruise. It can also be dangerous. In good weather and mostly favourable conditions it took us 11-12 hours of which much of the time you are isolated and far from any sort of medical help. This counts among one of the more difficult things I’ve done, and though brutal, the trip is ultimately extremely rewarding and I can highly recommend it if you want to see the less common side of the island and are up to the challenge. Prior experience on a motorbike or scooter is highly advised.

**The Route**

The normal way from Sandakan to KK cuts straight through the country along Route 22. The roads are relatively good and well travelled.

We didn’t take this route. Instead we decided to go from Sandakan to KK via Golong in the East (route map attached).

According to Google Maps there is only about a 2 hour difference. Don’t believe Google Maps. On 125cc scooters the estimated 8 hour route was in fact closer to 12 hours (the last hour of which is spent in KK traffic which is an event in itself).

This road via Golong has stunning views through and above the rainforests as you travel over mountains and curving passes. There are also long stretches of palm plantations on either side of the road and the occasional village which you miss if you blink too slowly. We didn’t actually see ”Golong” but the GPS says we passed it.

Other things you can expect to see along the way are beautiful rivers, majestic misty mountains, occasional oil tanker trucks, army roadblocks, livestock and possibly a variety of other critters. There are signs with pictures warning about wild animals such as elephants, bears, buck, wild pigs and apes as you are passing through the denser parts of the jungle.

Stop at the Robert Ong viewpoint, a small roofed observation deck about one third of your way, in between the mountains. It’s a breath-taking sight and good resting place for a few minutes break. We met a local couple who had also stopped to admire the scene. They shared with us the most delicious yellow watermelon. A proper highlight! You will recognize the viewpoint by a large sign next to the road and a panoramic view behind it.

**“Potholes”**

We were casually warned about “potholes” on the way. This is probably the most serious part of the ride. The so-called potholes are in fact intermittent stretches of road where the tar gives way to gravel pockmarked with dents and shallow pits that if not carefully negotiated can easily end your trip while you are in the middle of nowhere and out of cellphone service. The loose stones and sand make it easy to slide if you go too fast and because of the texture of the ground you only realize there is a hole in front of you once you are almost at its edge.

This hectic piece of the route is approximately 50km long. Take it easy and only celebrate your successful traversion of the section once you get to the Jalan Sapi Nangoh turn off other side of Golong. We did have a fall here and were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries - the road is a mess. Go slow.

**Weather**

We were very fortunate with the forces of nature. We had only one serious downpour of about 20 minutes while we were on a good section of road. If you can, try to plan your trip so as to avoid too much rain. The road is already very dangerous in hot sunny conditions, I don’t even want to think about how frustratingly slow the pothole section of the trip would be if the roads are muddy from rain.

**Checklist:**

* Have a big early breakfast. If you’re a traveller from afar make sure you eat something safe that won’t disagree with your stomach. This will not be the day for you to get the runs. Take some snacks. We expected there to be shops along the way to get food but the villages are not very developed along the road so we mostly lived off one small pack of almonds each and aforementioned yellow watermelon.
* Travel light. Only take what you need. We each had one backpack which contained all our clothes and things for the trip. If you have a lot of luggage this is probably not your trip’s kind of adventure anyway.
* Start early, start prepared. Our plan was to leave at 7am. After finding a means to strap our bags to the bikes (pic attached) and fueling up we only ended up getting out of Sandakan around 7:30am. Earlier would be better. Check when sunrise is and leave then. Make sure all your things are strapped and ready the night before if you can.
* Fuel. The importance of enough fuel cannot be overstated. The scooter you hire must come with a top box pannier which you will use almost exclusively to hold 1.5 litre bottles of petrol. They have rules at the petrol stations about filling bottles so make sure you have a funnel (Mr. DIY in Sandakan has them) and fill at least 4 or 5 bottles. 3 litres (full-ish tank) gets you about 100km safely. Plan accordingly. Buying fuel from next to the road in bottles is a last resort as they sometimes water it down. Basically if you see a petrol station, fill everything up, you don’t know how far the next one will be and there aren’t many.
* Water is as important as petrol. You will be constantly dehydrating as the equatorial sun bakes down on you and the free flowing wind of expedition will dry you out like a piece of biltong even in the 80% humidity. Stock up and drink it all the time.
* **Sun Protection:**
   * The island of Borneo lies on the equator. Don’t try to tan, you will burn if you do not keep something between you and the sun. I started off the morning in shorts and soon realized this wasn’t going to work as my thighs turned bright red and started itching from the sunburn. Fortunately I had a turkish towel to save my skin. Ideally some sort of lightweight long pants is what you need.
   * Sleeves are better than sunscreen. Not only is sunscreen very difficult to find in Sandakan but buying a long sleeve shirt and a scarf in the market/mall will be much cheaper and will be far more effective in keeping you unburned. A buff or scarf are essential for protecting your neck from second degree burns and also very useful for covering your face in the dust.
   * Sunglasses are important not just for eye protection against bright UV rays but also against flying bugs.
   * Gloves. As I write this my hands itch and flake off dead skin because for the first half of the day I had nothing covering my hands. Maybe a hand tan is a great conversation starter about your trip to the tropics but it does not look sexy and is annoying when bits of you shed on everything you touch. We stopped at a little hut that sold water, oil, maxi pads, dettol (which was useful after the fall) and Liverpool soccer socks. We cut the socks to make makeshift gloves. Worked like a sweaty dream.
* Take Dettol - your hut might not sell it.
* Rope to tie your bags to your bike - being unprepared, we scavenged some plastic rope and string from next to the road.
* GPS - learn the route before the time and save your GPS battery between long stretches without turn offs.

Lastly, we got our scooters from Bunnie at Scooter Monkey. The bikes and helmets were in great condition and gave us one less thing to worry about.",Borneo Backpackers - Scooter Adventure tips,,rockdoganomaly,,1,2022-06-09 13:59:54

backpacking,"Hi All, 

I am planning to travel to Malaysia, from Thailand, on the 11th of this month, however I am confused by the entry requirements. 

I have downloaded and created an account on MySejahtera. When I check my account it says I am fully vaccinated and at low risk. I’ve had 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine and I’m 22 which according to the Malaysian government counts as fully vaccinated. I am also British so receive a 3 month visa on arrival. I know that I now need to submit a pre departure form however I do not fully understand it. I’ve completed the majority of the fields however there are two I’m not sure about. It asks for “name of contact in Malaysia” and “phone number of contact in Malaysia”. I am unsure how to respond to this as I do not have a contact in Malaysia nor a phone number for them. These are required fields and I cannot submit the form without them. Can I just submit the name of the hostel I have booked and their phone number?

As I’m fully vaccinated will I have to provide evidence of a negative PCR/ATK test before departure? I have looked online and some sources say no and others say I must bring in a negative test result. 

If anyone has recently travelled to Malaysia I’d really appreciate if they could DM me with some information.

backpacking,"I recently finished a 30 mile 3 day backpacking trip in San Juan National Forest in SW Colorado. The 3 of us (my wife, a friend of mine, and myself) hiked 8 miles the first day, all uphill, about 1500 ft of elevation gain. As soon as we stopped to make camp, I had a horrible headache, one of the worst I’ve ever had. I set up my hammock, but the headache was too much. I started to get freezing, felt like vomiting, and had no appetite. I just had no strength and felt very disoriented. I went through 2 to 3 liters of water that day. I was eating plenty of food, had tortillas with lots of peanut butter and honey, and ate a few Clif bars and RxBars in the afternoon. It took my wife at least an hour to finally get me to eat, and another half hour or so for me to fully come back to myself. The next morning I felt perfectly fine and ready to go, so we decided to keep going.

The next day was basically the same story, except I had to poop 7 times by the end of the day! (Mostly solid, a bit wet though) I ate more throughout that day, drank at least 3 liters of water. We covered between 1500 to 2000ft of elevation gain over 11 miles. We finished the day with about 2 hours of descent. It took a little longer to set in, but the same thing happened that evening, but I had a little more time to prepare for it. I made my food while setting up camp, and started eating, but halfway through my meal, which I was really struggling to eat, I vomited everything back up.

The third day, we cut short and descended 6 miles and returned to the car. I was fine, outside of the strenuous work we’d put on our bodies.

I was therefore hoping to apply for a tourist visa while in Thailand for India at the local Indian embassy or VFS. However, I have heard that a British citizen in Thailand on a tourist visa can't apply for a tourist visa for Indian while in Thailand. Is this correct?

backpacking,"I’m writing to share about my honest experience on the World Race. I chose to write anonymously because I know there are many people who are looking to tear down the church and I didn’t want to add any fuel to that fire. I recognize this isn’t a God thing but a people thing and we all make mistakes. However, I would have liked to have read this article BEFORE raising $18,700, selling my car, and spending 9 months preparing. 

I ended up reading an article entitled “why I left the World Race” on month one of my World Race. I then proceeded to read five more from my squad alone before my departure. The ones that go into greater detail have been removed by the organization. So I find myself here.

Now I can’t discredit the fact that though this experience was not what it was made out to be, God can use any situation. I still grew in my relationship with the Lord and learned so much. My perspective was refreshed. I met some incredible people and experienced wild cultures and exotic places. 

With that being said, I value justice immensely and don’t want anyone to ever be made to feel the way I felt. These are some of my experience on the World Race by Adventures in Missions summarized by these main topics: 

**1. Lack of ministry**

**2. Manipulation &amp; gas lighting (sprinkled throughout)**

**3. Lack of accountability/pride**

**4. Lack of discipleship** 

**5. Lack of logistical structure**  

There are a number of things that are not made clear about the Race until you are at training camp - which is when you have already raised at least $12,000 - more or less when you’re in too deep. The way the Race mission trip is sold is as if it’s about the work done both through you and in you. What you begin to pick up on at camp but can’t possibly fully comprehend until your 8,000+ feet up in the mountains of Guatemala with 4 hours of ministry per week and nothing but corn fields and complete strangers around you - is that it’s really about what’s done in you. This brings me to my first point.

***Lack of ministry*** \- it was made clear that we needed to hold our Race experience loosely, because of the unpredictability with COVID. We were told the route would be anything from working in orphanages, rescuing woman in brothels, skate board ministry in Costa Rica, refugee work, rehabilitation of addicts, etc. As someone with a massively empathetic heart and desire to do something meaningful - I was inspired. The reality of MY Race experience of 9.5 months was legitimate ministry in 3/9 months. We did street evangelism for 8/9 months. This is not an exaggeration. I was placed at a host with 0 agenda for 6 months. The structure is that our squad of 29 was split up into five teams and placed at different ministries. 

At month one I was like, “okay better luck next month”. It was so hard to see other teams with great ministry month after month. When I brought it up to leadership I was told to, “take it to the Lord, clearly He keeps putting you in this position for a reason, find out what He’s speaking to you.” Or I was met with, “sometimes the ministry host is the biggest ministry of all!” I pressed into God and grew and learned immensely more than I would have if I was busy with my American way of living, and I’m thankful for that. However there was repeatedly no solution offered for this problem and it was starting to get to many teammates. This brings me to my next point. 

***Lack of accountability/pride*** \- This is a really tough one to wrestle with because I know these are inherently good people who have a relationship with the same Jesus I do. There were multiple instances where this organization would not follow through on their word or made decisions with poor judgment and did not own up to anything or proactively make a change. 

We happened to be in Romania (bordering Ukraine) when Russia struck. Innocent families were being used for target practice, people were melting snow for water. I was torn up at the thought. Our host at the time who was incredible immediately seized all operations and turned all efforts to helping the Ukrainians. This was done through food drives, convoys, shelter, transportation, etc. There just wasn’t a sense of urgency on AIM’s part. We were living in a 3 story mission house with ample room and our host asked if refugees could stay with us. As consenting adults we all agreed YES of course! AIM said no. We were not properly trained to work with refugees - yet our route description included refugee ministry???? It felt like a Titanic life boat situation. 

We were then told that someone would fly out to train us so we could serve them. The way this Green Cross training worked is it was supposed to be 7 days of refugee ministry on, 7 days refugee ministry off. It was an incredible training and I was truly ready to charge into Ukraine. I was then placed much closer to the Ukrainian border – two hours away. Yet I was with a ministry that would drop us off at high schools every day for their 20 minute break to invite students to church game nights. ?!?! 

The ministry requirement was supposed to be 4-8 hours of ministry daily. After 2.5-3.5 hours of wandering around the city/ high schools our host would say “well I don’t know what else to do with you so I can just take you home”. Not exaggerating. This is now month 7 of street evangelism/doing nothing in particular, now with a war waging just across the border. Meanwhile two other teams are burnt out working and living with refugees 24/7. There was no follow through on this 7 days on 7 days off rule either way.

When I brought this to leadership I was met me with, “you need to reflect and ask the Lord why you need to help with refugees so much when there are souls that could go to hell that need it just as much. Do you want to do this for your own glory?” Etc. It was getting to the point where I began to ponder and doubt my own intentions. 

***Lack of discipleship*** \- The Race is a constant pouring out of yourself. It’s beautiful to step outside of yourself and surrender to this degree. However, it’s also Biblical to be discipled by a wiser person through one of the most physically, mentally and spiritually intense and draining experiences in your life. We were told multiple times that we were in a “pressure cooker”. Many straight out of college and I know they have gap year programs. Yet there was no solid way to properly talk about and process what we were experiencing. 

There were two leaders in their early twenties who had done the Race before who were sent on the field with us who would rotate teams each month and were sent home after month 4. Loved them and wish they could have stayed! Other than that we had one 26 year old and a couple that volunteered back in the States who we could email. They would come on the field and we could have a 30 minute time slot once every 3-4 months. These spots were precious time that always felt so rushed and like they were just overwhelmed with tasks to finish in that one week. I know they’re great people. It was just hard not to feel like a box being check off. 

Members of the squad grew increasingly unhealthy as time dragged on. Some breaking down in tears daily, acting passive aggressive, depressed, or just down right unstable. When bringing this lack of discipleship point to leadership I was told, “that part of the intimacy and mission model is that we should be fully capable of discipling one another”. I don’t even think this is Biblical! We needed a Peter/Paul situation. This same organization also told us to, “lead with vulnerability” but that the most appropriate response is, “thanks for sharing”. This was what I was met with most times when I did open up. I didn’t expect my teammates who are doing this for the first time with me to have the answers!

We’re required to give “feedback” every ministry day - 5 days a week. This is when we are supposed to say in front of the team what one another could improve on and what they did well throughout the day. We’re supposed to point one another to the Lord. I totally understand the benefit in iron sharpening iron and the refining process. However, it began to create a toxic gossipy culture and added a lot of anxiety and paranoia. You always felt this pressure like you were being critiqued in all that you did. As people became unhealthy there was projection and passive aggression. It was not a safe space but it was also a nonnegotiable.

There was a very “hush hush” culture about the Race. Details would only be given to individuals with certain status on the squad such as places we were going, things we were doing, times we were leaving, certain decisions made that affected the whole squad, who would be consulted to make them. After a while it came to the point where I just let go and began to do what I was told. In a lot of ways the Race feels like signing away your freedom to become a subservient and incapable child. They say that you are surrendering to the Lord, but it often felt like you’re surrendering to whatever they decide you should be doing or whatever they saw as “honoring”.

***Lack of logistical structure*** \- A huge one that really threw me for a loop was the lack of logistical structure for a trip of this magnitude which has been done by this organization for over 20 years. We had a delegated logistics team within our squad who organized all transportation and housing for 29 of us plus the 3 leaders back in the states when they came to see us. These are other people who also raise $18,700 who have no experience finding ground transportation from Albania to Romania. This led to some weird and unnecessarily inconvenient situations. Such as 18 people on a 95+ degree bus for 18 hours, with a bus driver who is repeatedly falling asleep at the wheel. I’m literally hitting this man, blasting music, and feeding him to keep him awake. Logistics people often had to miss out on actual ministry days serving locals to spend hours making emails and phone calls to plan travel out. I think our logistics team did incredible. I just feel bad they had to do it at all!

We also ended up in every continent at the wrong season. The amount of times we heard, “you’re just not here at the right time of year was daunting”. Central America- rainy season, Eastern Europe- winter, Africa- winter/ rainy season. I know this was something AIM oversaw. 

Lastly, I think this could tie in just about every point I touched on. A teammate became increasingly unhinged as the Race went on. I’m thankful that the behavior was displayed in front of other squad mates because I truly believe this all sounds exaggerated with its ridiculousness. 

I was openly disrespected to the point of bullying in front of my team. Being “hushed”, yelled/cursed at, kicked out of the room we’re sleeping in, told that I am evil - twice, accused of lying, etc. She told our team she had a problem with the squad and didn’t like us, also that she was having trouble having compassion for us or wanting to be there for us when we were struggling. This is as we’re living, sleeping, working, ministry, everything together. She was also over $2,000 short of the ‘required’ fundraising amount and told the entire squad, leadership, and the World Race Program Manager that she would not be putting it into her fund but would be pocketing it. 

You get the picture. I took the Biblical approach and confronted her one on one about the disrespect, then with a team leader, until apparently we could not resolve it as two reasonable adults. It then had to be made into an intervention. Leadership on the field told me I needed to forgive her in my heart even if the issue didn’t get resolved and she never apologized. It didn’t. It became hard to sleep, I realize how irrational this sounds but it was to the point that I was nervous that she might do something to me in my sleep. Needless to say I was not in a good place mentally. So I brought it to leadership back in the States. That’s when the intervention came. She said it would be different the next month. It was a bit better but still passive aggressive. 

I did my time putting up with it - 4 months. At this point I was so fed up with everything. I told myself I wasn’t here for the Race, this was purely for God and for the people we were serving. I could finish the final 2.5 months because I wouldn’t have to be with this person everyday anymore. The rest was manageable. It was the only way to cope at this point. 

Well at the team change, leadership made her a team leader. I kid you not. Three other girls burst into tears and left the room at the news because they were afraid to be on a team with her. I lost it, feeling completely invalidated to the point of betrayal. I confronted leadership. They apologized that I felt that way, said that God led them to this decision, and that they would “respect my process”. 

I still said I would stick it out for the people and God. The closer I got to being reunited with the whole squad and leadership, the more triggered my anxiety became. When I tried to sleep at night my heart would feel like a rock. I was lucky if I got 5 hours and then there were nights I didn’t sleep at all. It was so hard to feel that I was safe with certain squad mates or leadership in this environment. So I left with only 7 weeks left. When I got home and lay in my bed, my entire body ached. I realized it was from being tensed up for so long. 

*I’ve come to realize that the World Race by Adventures in Missions is a lot like Russian Roulette*. You could ask some people on my Race and they would say that they had a good time and decent ministry. Or you could talk to the five people on my squad that left before me. I’m just here to share a little slice of my experience that I would have liked to have read myself. By all means follow the Lord’s leading and do what you feel called to do. My advice is to do your investigating first. Talk to people who have done the Race since 2020. Feel free to message me if you’d like to read my World Race blog which delves more into the positive experiences or to ask any questions.",My Honest Experience with the World Race by Adventures in Missions AIM,,exworldracer,,2,2022-06-06 01:21:11

I plan to pack the following items in the bag weighing around 22#.

travelling to Europe with €6,400(plane tickets already paid) in peak season.

I want to see all the landmarks and beauties of Switzerland and do a couple of thrilling activities like paragliding and rock climbing and ofcourse THE DAMN ALPS. I plan on getting a Swiss Travel Pass and want to explore the worthy cities and villages which is quite a lot. Ill stay in €24 hostels every night there. I want to see some chocolate and learn about the culture. 

Barcelona. Party, Explore, Landmarks, Activities, Cuisine, dance. My plane tickets to and from are €90. I also want to have a night in Ibiza possibly. Im sober and refuse alcohol or drugs so cut those costs from partying, i just want to have fun nights out. Hostels are €41 a night. I expect to eat pricier dinners. I might go on a fun cheap boat adventure but will definitely do so in Italy. Ill be entering a few museums hopefully and must see’s.

Italy from south to north back up to Switzerland. 

My plane from Barcelona lands in Naples, there on i will take a cheap high speed ferry to the Amalfi coast. Ill stay in one of the smaller and cheaper towns along the coast and do day trips by ferry to the other towns. Room €54 a night. A relax day too. Some clothe shopping if much. Thinking of taking a adventure boat to capri to see the blue grotto and beaches for very cheap. Not planning to stay long just to see it pretty well and have while no hassles break in a pretty place with pretty culture. 

High speed Italiatrens on this trip add up to about €110 prebooked. 

Rome, i want a full experience but a short trip might have to suffice because of budgets. Romes the most important place in italy id like to go to so i want the most time spent there. I want to see all of the landmarks, go into the good ones, pay extra for underground colosseum and such. More expensive but safer and vibrant areas like Trastevere. Im honestly looking at €54-€80 a night unless i can find something cheaper. 

Florence to figure out practically everything about italia, or so ive heard. I really think id enjoy this city and not just for the food! But the history sounds amazing too. I wish i was also travelling around Tuscany for the rich beauty but am afraid i wont have the right funds. If i could though id buy an outdoor adventure to do around that area but not sure if i should yet. €33 a night in a hostel estimate.

Well thats all the places on my trip itinerary. Some other places id desperately want to go in Europe is Czech Republic, Portugal and Berlin, but i dont think id be able to fit one in with my jam packed travelling and medium budget spending. Let me know how many dates i should stay in these places, ofcourse id stay forever if i could but my cats need me. This trip will be so exciting, the tickets are paid and are changeable so that is not included in the budget. Thankyou all who read this, i really look forward to hearing anyones thoughts on this.","Budgets &amp; Time spending! All of Switzerland, Barcelona, Italy",,tdfhucvh,,9,2022-06-05 11:32:52

backpacking,"Hi Guys, looking for some advice for a trip that myself and a 2 friends have been planning for a few months now. We entered the lottery and scheduled for the latest possible trip, but as most sites were reserved and we got a late date to reserve the latest we could schedule was for the 25th of June through the 4th of July. 

Background - we are all mid 20's and in decent / good shape. We have been backpacking each summer for the last two years and are fairly regular hikers in our free time. Starting with the Timberline Trail and then doing Brokentop in Bend Oregon last summer which had a decent amount of snow. We have done lots of research on the trail and the Gear needed. Spending easily a thousand between the 3 of us on food, better gear, warmer clothes, etc. 

As our trip is getting closer I've become increasingly concerned about the snow at the higher points of the trail. After going through several threads the consensus seems to be that if there has been heavy snowfall the upper portions of the trail can be very dangerous. We have some experience with snow, but not as much as I would like. We will all be investing in crampons, would ice axes be needed as well? Any advice is appreciated, especially if it eases my concerns lol.

backpacking,"Ive dreamt of doing a backpacking trip across tje outbacks Europe for years. Been preparing a lot. Also worked out in the gym to the point where I can say I'm definitely more fit than the majority of people. Saved up a lot of money. Been eating almost textbook healthy for the past half year. Been on many full day hiking trips (~20-25km)
Ive been so excited and wanted to finally start with something smaller to see if I'm ready. A 3-5 days hike from Ljubljana to Triest. Bought all my gear, prepared to the point of where Im basically ready to leave.
Here's my issue: Chronic IBS-C /Constipation &amp; Bloating hit me about 4 years ago, along with many intolerances, Lactose, gluten, histamine, sorbitol. I'm dealing with all of this every single day of my life. At home its still somehow managable, because I can cook and always have the chance for a bathroom if needed. But I never manage to get the symptoms away- constant stinging pain from the bloating and a feeling of fullness due to constipation. &lt;- if im hungry and weak and force myself to eat it worsenes,  if I dont i feel really weak and out of energy. And in addition to that, the stomach strap of my backpack would be constantly pressing on the pain areas. Constanly feeling weak, despite having a well balanced diet. Ive been to the docs a lot, but they cant find any issues either.
Do I have to drop this dream? Its making me so goddamn depressed and feeling useless. Its like the only thing I ever really wanted to do in life, but it feels like it would be more pain and fatigue than spending a amazing time outdoors. I love nature and it my past hikinh trips were kinda the only things that helped me feel better in life.
Ive tried a lot of different meds, any recommendations against constipation, drink about 2-3L a day, physical pelvic floor therapy. It just feels hopeless. I feel like all these years of preparing were for nothing.
I'm aware that I am not t fault or shouldnt blame myself. It's more about me wanting this so bad, but feeling like it's only possible alongside a lot of pain, and thats everything else than I wanted.
I'm still willing to try again, even though my past attempts in this lead to failure. I have enough for a taxi home from any point if the pqin gets so bad, but even the it feels like a waste, because I feel like I can already see this coming...
By now im basically sitting in the bathroom crying, starring at my packed backpack in the corridor...
Has anyone else here ended up in this situation? How did you deal with it?

backpacking,"Hello! 

I live in northern NJ and am interested in going backpacking, starting at an overnight trip.

I go hiking fairly often for day trips. In high school (10+ years ago) I completed a week long hike along the Appalachian Mountains through a program my school had. I would love to go back and experience the solitude and independence again.

Since I would be a beginner, I have a few questions:

What supplies would I need? 

How do I avoid animals in search of food? I specifically remember hanging food on a tree about a half mile or so from where we would camp. 

What trails are beginner friendly in the general area? I’m fine with going into PA or NY close to NJ.

What foods are suggested?

I remember using tarp and rope to create a tent….What tent set-up is most suggested? Or tent brand. 

What are your highly rated/suggested supplies?

What are your highly suggested hiking boots?

What trails are the safest for overnight stay? I keep thinking of the one thing the teacher that ran the program said during high school - that most murders occur near entrances or highly tracked areas.

Are any supplies often found at second-hand stores? I’m very big on sustainability and owning second hand, so I plan on looking in those areas rather than buying new (at least at first/if it can be done).

I would be going on my own, as my husband is not a fan of hiking (or the outdoors in general, haha).

That being said - are there any backpacking groups in northern NJ?

backpacking,"Me and my partner purchased 2 Katadyn Befree water filters for a 5 month trip to South America. We'd do multiple hikes but would also use them for the tap water.

A little less than a month in, one sprung a leak. No worries, there's a leak free guarantee. I tested both bottles if the filter was still working (blow back test) and apparently both filters had already been compromised and shouldn't be used.

11/5 I filled the contact form on katadyn's website to ask for advice and if a replacement or repair was possible.

16/5 I emailed them

18/5 I emailed them again

28/5 I messaged them on Facebook

Still no response at all

Just wanted to rant about that horrible costumer service. 
Any advice on repairing katadyn befree bottles? What water filters do you advice for a trip like this?",Katadyn Befree Costumer Service,,Climpmeister,,6,2022-05-31 12:57:57

backpacking,"Me and some friends have a backpacking trip coming up in a few weeks where we will be doing a loop around the Presidential Mountain Range in the New Hampshire White Mountains. We are super excited, and we currently have the following route planned out:

https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/mount-washington-via-tuckerman-ravine-and-lion-head-trail-211c1e0--3

None of us have ever been to the area before, and I have been trying to research the trail as much as possible ahead of time as I have heard this area of hiking is quite difficult. 

It will be a 4 day/3 night trip, and on the first night we will be staying at the Osgood Tent Campsite.

The concern is on the next two days of camping. My initial thought was that from the Osgood site, we would hike ~3 miles up to the Madison Spring Hut area and camp there. Ideally we could go further on the second day, but the only other campsite I see that isn't super far out of the way of the current route is the Harvard Cabin region, which is near the very end of the trail.

Is anyone familiar with this area of the country that would have an idea if there are other potential camping sites along this route that I am not seeing on the map? Ideally, we would have another cap site somewhere between Madison Springs and Harvard Cabin. I saw Storm Lake and thought that would be a great mid-way point for day 2, but it is above the tree line so we cannot stay there.

If there is nothing in the area, then we will probably just get up early on the 3rd day and send all of the peaks on that day. Ideally we would be able to take our time and enjoy the peaks, but we will do what we must. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",White Mountains Presidential Loop Backpacking Camp Sites Question,,erocc123,,7,2022-05-31 12:30:48

backpacking,"Hi all - I spent last Saturday hiking and wild camping on Kinder Scout located in the Peak District (UK). Weather was clear and sunny with a small breeze until later in the evening when the wind picked up. 

I tried out my new Lanshan Pro 2 and also seam sealed it. Struggled to set it up in all honesty. Luckily I had a phone signal so watched a couple of YouTube videos to help me. It stayed solid in the wind so I must have done it ok in the end. I guess it will get easier/better with practice. Had absolutely no condensation either. Not sure if that was luck or more down to my poor pitch which left plenty of room for a breeze to get through! Plenty of room in the tent though and great to be able to sit up in it. 

Also tried out my new Nemo Tensor sleeping pad (long wide version) and I have to say it’s a side sleepers dream! I absolutely loved it. Would recommend to anyone. Video below if anybody is interested. Happy camping everyone.

I’m thinking of travelling around South America for about 4 - 5 months. It'll be my first trip there and I'd like to visit Colombia, Ecuador/Galapagos, Peru/Machu Picchu, Bolivia/Uyuni, Chile, Argentina/Patagonia/Ushuaia and Brazil. Pretty ambitious, but I'm also open to slow things down/leave them out if necessary once I get there.    


I've got two options and I’m trying to decide which is a better timeframe for the trip, and if these itineraries make sense given the weather at the time.    

 &amp;nbsp;

Option A: Aug - Dec 2022 

I’ve read that weather from Aug - Dec will be ideal for most if not all the destinations above. With this option, I'd most likely have to fly into Santiago. My itinerary would be:    
-Start by flying up to Bogota, Colombia August    

-Ecuador/Galapagos August    

-Peru September    

-Bolivia September

-Northern Chile/Santiago September/October

-Patagonia/Ushuaia October/November 

-Make my way up to Buenos Aires and Iguazu Falls November

-End with Sao Paulo, Brazil December    

 &amp;nbsp;

Option B: Jan - May 2023

I’m also studying an online course which finishes in Dec 2022. It's pretty chill at 2 days a week and I think I’d be able to keep up with coursework while travelling. But might be a better idea to complete it first and go in January. Has anyone done something similar before? How did you find the wifi/internet situation in SA?
Rainy season during the early months up north means weather is less ideal. So, I'm thinking of doing the reverse of above:

-Start by flying into Sao Paulo, Brazil January

-Working down to Iguazu Falls and Buenos Aires January/February

-Patagonia/Ushuaia February/March

-Northern Chile/Santiago March 

-Bolivia/Uyuni April 

-Peru/Machu Picchu April 

-Ecuador April/May

-End with Bogota, Colombia late May

 &amp;nbsp;

What do you guys think? Would these itineraries hold up given the weather?

backpacking,"# Current Packing Notes
This packing list is the base for pretty much all my travels.  It changes slightly 
with the destination, planned activities, purpose, and climate, but not the duration.

## Pack
I've been using an Osprey Porter 30 for quite some time now, but I'm currently
planning on shifting to a REI Trail 40.  I have successfully traveled with much
smaller packs, even nearly pack-less, but these days, I unfortunately have to 
bring more stuff because of medical conditions than I used to.  Compression
garments to manage the lymphedema I have in my right leg (due to a surgery
that removed some lymph nodes) are not particularly compact, Ideally, 
I will bring a small compression pump device and sleeve as well.  The ones
that are sold for high level athletes work well, and are much smaller than
the ""medical"" ones, but they're still quite bulky, so I need more space than I used to.

The main things I look for in a pack are comfort/fit, and durability.
I don't generally care if it's a top-loader or a clamshell, or whatever
other variations there are, and while having external attachment points
are handy, as are external pockets for things like water or 
somewhere to stuff a jacket, these things matter more when I'm hiking/camping
than when I'm traveling. 

This is just my opinion, but you don't really need to stress too much about
what pack to get, so long as your load is light.  If your load gets heavy, then
it matters a lot more.  Waterproofing is most easily accomplished by just lining
your bag with a heavy trash bag, or storing things you don't want to risk getting 
wet in ziploc bags.  Actually waterproof bags are heavy, and sorta waterproof bags
are not really that waterproof.

I go back and forth about packing cubes, but some way to organize and possibly compress
things is a good idea.  Ziplocs can work well here too, actually.  Or there are 
heavy duty ziploc kind of bags that have one way valves that you can really compress.
Or just use stuff sacks, or compression sacks, or even compression sacks
that are waterproof.  There's a lot of options.  I'm currently playing around with the
valved ziploc style ones.

## Clothing
I bring 2 changes of clothes, which along with the one I'm wearing, gives me 
more than enough.  When I'm traveling by myself, it's often just one change 
of clothes.  I prefer that, but sometimes when I'm traveling with my spouse, it's 
easier to have some flexibility about when we do laundry in the sink.

A ""change of clothes"" for me means ""underwear, socks, compression garment, 
long sleeved merino t-shirt, and pants (not jeans)"" although I usually just bring two
pairs of pants regardless of how many ""changes"" I have.  

There's a lot of options these days when it comes to things that are quick drying
and odor resistant, that don't look like you're heading out on safari, which makes this easier.

If it's going to be cooler, I bring a light sweater or a light fleece/wool hoodie,
and some sort of shell.  If it's going to be much colder, I bring some gloves 
and a wool beanie, and a heavier hoodie/fleece, or a down puff jacket.  If it's going to be hotter, I might swap out the merino wool long sleeves for short sleeves, and bring a sun hat.  

I always bring sunglasses.  I bring sandals if it's going to be crazy hot (i.e.
somewhere close to the equator), otherwise, it's hiking shoes, light casual boots, 
or light hiking boots, depending on activities. I usually just have one pair, at most a pair of shoes/boots, and some sandals/ultralight running shoes. 

If there's a need for it, I bring a swimsuit and a little sort of waist bag
that has waterproof bags in it that I can put valuables in along with my phone.

I bring a moneybelt to carry valuables, especially if I'm going somwhere that
has a lot of pickpockets.

## Toiletries
I bring a comb, a cartridge razor and some blades, a toothbrush, dental floss,
some baking soda in a canister, and a bar of soap in a little rollup sleeve 
that I found at REI. If I know I will be staying at better (2 star and up) hotels,
I may not even bring the soap because they usually have shampoo, soap, conditioner,
and body lotion gratis. While I don't recommend brushing your teeth constantly with
baking soda, it works well enough for trips, and it's also useful to have some
to sprinkle in your shoes if they start to get stinky, and for mixing with water
to deal with heartburn.

My laundry kit is a braided elastic clothesline, a larger microfiber type towel,
and a Scrubba bag, which is essentially a rolltop drybag with a valve that works
really well for washing clothes in.

I travel with a small first aid kit, and bring along the few medicines I take
(in a ziploc bag, I have copies of the prescriptions), and usually some ibuprofen
and some acetaminophen as well.  If I expect there to be the chance of an allergic
reaction, maybe some diphenhydramine too.  Anti-diarrhea pills if I'm going somewhere
that the food or water might cause me trouble.  Lactaid if I know I'm not going to be able to find non-dairy meals. If I can manage it, I get a doc to write me an RX for a Zpak,or some other broad spectrum antibiotic.  A few antibacterial wipes and some tissue/TP round things out.

I usually bring a spare pair of glasses, along with the ones I'm wearing after losing mine one time and having to deal with getting new ones on the road.  

I bring earplugs, and either a buff (amazingly useful, actually) to use as an eye-mask.  I've tried using melatonin on long flights, but it doesn't seem to do much for me.  Some people I know get a few doses of valium or similar to help them sleep on long flights.  I never bothered, although I might consider it if it was a 12+ hour flight, to be honest.

## Electronics
I bring an iphone, and add on some sort of international plan if needed.  I use this 
as my camera as well.  I bring a headset of some kind (ear buds), with noise cancelling capabilities.

I will grudgingly bring a laptop if I have to work.  I bring a watch, 
which is very handy, so long as it has an alarm function.  I have chargers and 
an adapter and a small power strip and a battery pack.  

## Papers and the like
The usual deal of having copies of your passport and important papers and info
in a few places, some emergency cash in a few places, and so forth.  I keep copies of
everything on dropbox and usually also in emails, and make sure to sync the 
stuff I need from dropbox using the ""offline"" function to my phone.

## A few oddities
While they're really not strictly necessary for most travel, I have found
that packing the 10 essentials in some form or another has come in handy 
more frequently than I thought.  This means I have navigation (compass, map of
area, possibly a GPS and batteries, but more often my phone instead of the GPS), illumination (headlamp with spare batteries, maybe a small flashlight too), first aid (see above), fire (a lighter at least), shelter (a space blanket, or even a tarp shelter, depending), some water (I use a Vapur one), some food (Lara bars are tasty), extra clothes (i.e. what I already pack), sunscreen/sunglasses/hat/bug repellent, and ideally some sort of tool/knife.  

That last is somewhat difficult, if you're flying but you can get TSA allowed mini-multi-tools, or if it's a longer trip, I just buy a pocket knife at my destination and mail it back or gift it before I go home.  Or I throw in a small manicure set that has blunt nosed scissors and a cuticle trimmer, and a little screwdriver set, and that works too.

I have learned that carrying a packable bag (like a reusable nylon shopping bag)
comes in remarkably handy at times. I have a Baggu one.

## How it works
I've managed to travel using this set up on trips ranging from a few days to several weeks, and to locales as different as major US cities to the Galapagos, the Camino Inka, and the Amazon (not camping), and all over Europe.  It usually weighs in around
15lbs and certainly no more than 20lbs (7-9 kg). It's easy to maneuver, easy to carry, and can even go under the seat sometimes, and can certainly be set on my lap if I'm on a bus or train.  I'm working on paring it down more, but I'm feeling pretty good where I'm at right now.",As a comparison - my current general load out for travel,,Malcolm_KS0T,,2,2022-05-27 17:32:02

backpacking,"The trip will consist of a 18 hr flight to (and back from) Indonesia, and mainly hopping from area to area by airplane/train/car and staying in hotels/hostels. So we will not camp outside. I like to take with me my clothes, camerabag (15cm / 6 inch dimensions), extra pair of shoes and maybe a laptop. Any recommendations on backpacks? I am not sure what I should look for regarding backpack volume, will 40L suffice? Or should I be looking for 50L or even 70L? I am not someone who changes clothes three times a day. My budget is around €100 (£85/$107). 

I am not sure which shoes to take with me. I am looking for something which offers both utility and looks somewhat nice, as hiking will not be a majority activity I will be doing. 

How is the weather in Indonesia (and mainly Java) around November? Should I anticipate great rainfall by packing extra clothes to change into?

What are some excellent travel items (you don't really think about when you are planning your first trip)?

Any other recommendations, even completely unrelated, are greatly appreciated!

backpacking," Gf and I are planning to travel in South America from around January to October next year. The plan was tentatively to start in Colombia in January and slowly work our way down the west coast to Chile and finally hit Argentina and Chile by September, and spend a significant amount of time doing hikes and exploring Patagonia.

I understand that Jan-Feb is considered the best weather-wise in Patagonia, but also the most busy in terms of visitors and therefore also the most expensive.

Should we start in Argentina/Chile first in January to take advantage of the summer months to explore Patagonia? Or should we stick to our North-to-South plan and arrive in Chile in August or September to take advantage of fewer crowds? We don't mind chilly weather (we're Canadian) but we're not into winter sports. So while colder weather isn't an issue, full-on snow and ice would be a no-go and it would have to be safe to explore obviously

backpacking,"Anyone have any thoughts on the Solomon Quest Element boots?

I am looking for a more heavy duty backpacking boot because I was stupid before and using some lightweight boots before that were really just trailrunners with ankle support. At the end of almost any backpacking trip and some longer day hikes my feet would always be killing me. 

I am leaning toward the Solomon Quest 4 GTX boots just because they seem the most comfortable for heavy packs and long trips. I'm just worried they might be a little overkill for little hikes and that my feet will run really hot here in CA where I do most of my trips nowadays. I think they'll be great for my longer winter  trips though, and I'll sacrifice the weight for comfort over the Solomon X Ultra 4s. 

However, looking at REI I found the Solomon Quest Element that looks like a good in-between boot that would be more comfortable for heavy packs and 20 mile trips, but wouldn't get too hot in the summer.
I just can't really find any in depth reviews to make sure that they might be a good compromise. 

Any suggestions on which of these boots might be best?
M 28, 200 lbs. Normally ~35+ lbs packs 5-30 mile trips in CA. I have Solomons now and like their stuff and they seem highly recommended, but open to other brands too.

TL;DR
Any thoughts on the Solomon Quest Element hiking boots for medium long trips with heavy packs?

We saw a few people older than ourselves and they were struggling. We decided then, that we were not going to become an unfortunate statistic.

backpacking,"My Friends brother (Manikant Kondaveeti) went missing from 12th May in Azerbaijan. If anyone else is currently travelling in this region or had travelled earlier, please suggest what other approaches we can take to find him.  


\--------------

  
Below is the detailed timeline :  


Arrived at Azerbaijan on 26th April 2022 via connecting flight from Sharjah. Delhi to Sharjah to Baku. Took 2 bags with him, 1 big rucksack and 1 small backpack. Met several locals and also a french traveller Wei Ming on his travels through Azerbaijan.

He stayed at Zaqatla hotel ([https://goo.gl/maps/YmV8ZCmdSGeaxsxH6](https://goo.gl/maps/YmV8ZCmdSGeaxsxH6)) on 11th May and checked out on the morning of 12th May. He paid for his stay at the hotel but left his bag in the Zaqatla Hotel and later asked a local to speak on his behalf saying he would send someone to pick up the bag on his behalf. The bag contains his passport and work laptop. He used Google Translate to communicate with locals. He was in the zaqatla forest on 12th afternoon-evening and wanted to go back to the city.

He searched for ""Is it safe to go back to Zaqatla tonight"" on his google translate around 6pm. He eventually stayed with some locals in a hut overnight on 12th and left the hut after speaking to the local at 9am on 13th. He asked the local about some snowclad peaks which were visible from there and the local told him the way back. He may not have understood the way back properly. As seen by a local on 13th Morning, he had his small backpack which contained a banana and an apple and his charger and would have been pretty light.

His phone had no internet activity after 12th evening-night (from his google account history) and no messages got delivered to his whatsapp after 7pm, 12th May (Indian Standard Time). He asked locals about a place to charge his phone on 12th night. After that, no one has volunteered any information about meeting him. 

He had a flight to Uzbekistan on 17th May but did not show up for it.

\---------------

Relevant Information about the missing person :

Has walked distances of 25+ kilometres in a day during his travels. Likes to explore while travelling but does not take undue risks, generally travels safely and sees offbeat places but not dangerous places.

Passport Number - R4666089

Indian Phone Number (Airtel) - 8050961625

IMEI Numbers - Available in case needed {Removed for safety as suggested}

Local Azerbaijani Number - 0709623353

\-----------

Family and Friends Timeline :

Noticed that messages sent to Mani and the family whatsapp group weren't getting delivered to Mani since 13th May. Got worried after 2 days of no delivery. Contacted embassy of India in Baku on 15th May morning. After some back and forth, we gave some information which was requested and information we had. Asked to escalate to search immediately on 15th itself as it was very unusual to not have contact with Mani for such a long duration. Family went through his personal laptop in Mumbai where he stayed before departing for his trip. The laptop had his google account logged in on the browser and Whatsapp web was also logged in (Whatsapp Web can now retrieve chats without requiring the connected phone number to be active) and noted down all possible information which could be found via his whataspp chats with locals and especially Wei Ming who spoke in english with him and was travelling with him till 10th May. His google account history had a lot of information via Google Translate searches, google maps search history, google search history. After a couple of days, after several requests and Mani not taking his flight to Uzbekistan on 17th May, finally the embassy seemed to stir into action in informing the local police, etc. Proper searching only started on 18th or 19th May. Tried to tweet to important officials via an NGO in order to create awareness about Mani's disappearance and expedite the search. Mani's friend posted on facebook which attracted several comments from the locals who are searching along with the police. Tried to provide any information the search parties requested.

\----

Avenues explored in order to expedite search :

1) Tried to get his exact coordinates via Airtel and other sources (through his IMEI number). Airtel nodal officer said he was unable to do so and asked to file a complaint with the police regarding phone Tracking.

2) Asked Ambassador about any help which India can provide in order to expedite the search. Ambassador communicated this with the local forces and we are awaiting a response back.

3) Contacted some of the locals who are a part of the search party including around 50 people.

4) Started a twitter movement to reach the Prime Minister and the minister of external affairs so that we can get some more help from India. (Drone techonology, etc.)

5) Contacted media houses to get the story covered, got a response from the Quint and they are covering the story.

backpacking,"I am getting ready to embark on my 6-week backpacking trip through Europe in which I already have bought my plane tickets, train pass, and paid for all of my hostel stays.  In regards to food / leisure is it reasonable for me to give myself a budget of $2000 ($50/day)? I intend on making most of my meals myself and going to grocery stores, spending a lot of my time doing free things but obviously will enjoy activities if they really pop out to me.

I will be going to Greece (Thessaloniki 3 nights, Litochoro / Olympus 2 nights, (Santorini 3 nights, Athens 3 nights, both places with my girlfriend) - 11 nights total), Italy (Rome 5 nights, Florence 4 nights, Brixen 3 nights - 12 nights total), Switzerland (Lauterbrunnen 3 nights, Lucerne 3 nights - 6 nights total), Portugal (8 nights in Lisbon with a family member so likely will not spend much here), and Amsterdam (2 nights).

1.  Do most backpackers meet people online and find their living accommodations before they enter the new country or do they just find all that once they get there? I assume a hostel is the first place people  will stay?    

2. Do most backpackers just travel around without staying in one city for too long or is it wise to stay in one city for a period of time for a homebase but still travel around on weekends days off on a weekday or take time off to travel? One of my favorite parts of traveling is making deep and meaningful new friendships and connections and then experiencing a new day to day with them. I feel like based off that having a homebase would be nice but I would love to hear everyone’s experience and feelings about both perspectives im open to whatever.     

3. What cities/suburbs would you guys recommend for me to live at based on my criteria below. Im a 24-year-old male from United States who likes outdoorsy activities such as beaches mountains cool hangout spots, good going out at night bar scene not so much club scene, younger outgoing crowd, good weather, good vibes and cool restaurants cafes, while for the most part on the cheaper end (affordable). As I stated above one of my favorite parts of traveling is making deep and meaningful new friendships and connections and then experiencing a new day to day with them. I would love to go to a place that offers this opportunity.

backpacking,"Hey everyone!

Writing to you from Nafplio, Greece, 3 weeks into what is going to be a 4 month backpacking trip through the Balkans and some of Central/Eastern Europe.

I wanted to share some of my general thoughts with you guys, where I got burned on money so far, what ended up cheaper than I expected, and other various things.

To start off,

Utilize Google maps. I feel this is an obvious one to many, but the amount of people I have come across who don't know how to use the website/app to its full potential is shocking.

Searching for places to sleep is, in my humble opinion the easiest to do while zooming in on the location of interest in Google maps, and clicking the ""hotels"" button, which then shows you every hotel in the vicinity and the price. You can even put in the dates you want to find availabilities. I'd avoid websites like booking.com and trivago or whatever else exists. I always find the phone number of a place of interest, and directly call them to confirm prices and availabilities. 

Secondly, utilize supermarkets. This is a big one for me. If you are looking to longterm travel (anything over a month), and want to save some money, make your own sandwiches! Don't sit down at a tavern, restaurant, or whatever every meal, instead go to a supermarket. They often have cooked meals/sandwiches/burgers inside which are usually much much cheaper than sitting down at an establishment. I'm not saying don't sit down at all, but don't do it for every meal! The fun of it wears off if it's all you do...

While we are on this topic, location matters! That supermarket is going to have higher prices if it's in the middle of downtown! The same goes for cornershops, rooms, basically anything. When I am booking a room to stay in, the first thing I look for is proximity to a bus station, and that it's not in the middle of tourist central. I'd also really recommend taking that extra 5-10min walk out of downtown to shop for food, or even sit down to eat. The prices change astronomically! Also, you're better off (in terms of enjoyment, and finances-usually) to book a room in 1 location which is in an area that is close to public transport for a couple days, rather than hop from location to location sleeping in a different place every night. It usually ends up being cheaper, and you don't have to pack up everything and move all the time. It feels more like a vacation this way.

To not keep this too long, I'll add one more tip.

Find someone to travel with. Whether it's someone you meet on the road, or a friend from your hometown, anyone you can get along with. Keep it to a pair in my opinion as rarely will you fully enjoy yourself in a big group of let's say 6 (everyone usually wants to do something different).  I've saved about a thousand dollars so far just by travelling with my girlfriend instead of alone. Oftentimes a room in a motel is cheaper than 2 beds in a hostel. That sandwich looks really big that you just ordered? You can split it. 2 budgets, one mind goes a long way. Not to mention that you're safer this way, and should you want to hitchhike (don't be afraid to do this with 2 people!), people are more likely to pick you up when there's 2 of you rather than alone.

I could write all day, but this is already a book.

If you like me, and want to see what I'm all about and how I'm making 4 months of travel possible on a really low budget, check out my humble channel, I've just started creating travel videos, and I'm fairly consistent:)

backpacking,"Hi everyone. On Sunday I was supposed to fly from Schiphol airport back home to end my amazing trip to Holland. But what was supposed to be a pretty basic procedure ended up as a nightmare. 

I arrived at the airport around 2 hours prior to boarding. I headed where the queue for security was and Iwas shocked. It was the longest worm-like queue I've ever seen. So I get in line and 1 hour goes by, I'm ok I still have time. Around the 2 hour mark i start panicking that I'm gonna miss my flight. Meanwhile, people around me are fighting for a better spot or crying because their flight just left, and I'm still standing and watching the security check counters closing one by one. The airport made some announcements on how understaffed the security spots were and how sorry they were for the long queues. The only personnel I saw was some heavy armed policemen that were there to break off people fighting each other because they ""cheated"" to get a better spot in line. Long story short I waited 3 and a half hours there and ended up missing my flight home. It was midnight and no one was there to help me. I need advice where to seek for compensation both for my missed flight and for the physical and mental torment the airport put me through, as the airline declined to refund stating it was me that failed to to be to the gate on time.

TLDR: I missed my flight because the airport was understaffed and the security check took 3,5 hours. Airline declines to refund me and need advice on how to handle this.",Need advice on airport compensation,,between3_20chars,,12,2022-05-25 11:17:36

2. 1-2 nights in a hut. Love the hut scene. But also...

Ideally I pass a store or two where I can buy local cured meats and cheese for my lunch picnic later in the day. Cultural interest - interesting architecture, interesting food - is a huge bonus.
4. Less popular may be better. I don't want it to feel completely overrun. Ski resort or adventure sports hub where hang gliders are constantly passing overhead? No thanks. Would rather bump into a shepherd that doesn't speak English.

I'm looking to travel to a few select countries in Europe over the summer.  I do not have exact dates for where/when/how long I'll be in each area.  Overall, my travels will over occur over a 10 week period starting in July.

Here are some questions I would like to pose to the experts in travel:

* What is the best way to book open flights to different destinations?  Are there any packages like X number of Cities within Y period?
* Given the current climate (China/Wuhan Virus, restrictions, etc.), what is the safest place for lodging? Are hostels safe enough?

We came across the [Vango Helvelly 300](https://www.vango.co.uk/gb/camping-equipment/732-helvellyn-300.html) at the price of €250, which suits most of our wants and needs. A more expensive alternative is the [Robens Pioneer 3ex](https://www.robens.de/en-gb/shop-1/outdoor-tents/pioneer-3ex) (± €300), which has a bigger area for our gear but we're concerned about its capabilities to withstand the wind. Although Robens makes claims about their tent being very withstanding to wind, we think that the first alternative might be better. 

Does someone have experience with any of these tents or brands and are there alternatives within this price range that we overlooked?

backpacking,"I'm not a backpacker, I'm a motocamper. I camp off the back of my dual sport motorcycle. Weight isn't so much of an issue with that but size is, so I do have a decent amount of backpacking gear - but not a backpacking backpack. I only have a 21L GoRuck GR0 which is my daily backpack.

A friend invited me on a 3 day backpacking hike in the Catskills, which will be new for me. I think the intention is to do somewhere in the range of 15-25mi. I'm not really planning on making yet another hobby out of this, so I'm trying to resist the urge to be a gearwhore and drop $500 gucci gear on what might be a one time trip.

I have enough room inside the bag for:

* camping quilt
* sleeping pad
* 3L hydration bladder (\~2/3 full)
* headlamp
* extra socks and underwear
* 5 mountain house pro paks
* sunglasses
* earbuds
* spoon
* painkillers
* cloth bandaids (ghetto moleskin)
* water tablets
* silicon accordion cup
* poncho (or umbrella? unsure which I wanna bring)

On the outside of the bag:

* leatherman case on molle
* filter water bottle on molle
* my sunglasses/extra contacts/eyedrops /lip balm case on molle
* 2P tent rolled up and bungee'd to the top (or bottom, or vertical on the back, haven't decided yet)
* sun hat and hiking wear on my person
* solar battery pack hanging out of zip pocket

This leaves a few things on my list that don't quite fit:

* wet wipes
* instant coffee
* peanut butter, and any additional snacks
* MSR stove kit
* camp pillow
* book (if there's room)
* small towel/cloth (if there's room)
* any extra clothing (if there's room)
* additional toiletries (if there's room

backpacking,"I was sized for a backpack several months ago at REI. Apparently the sizing guy was certain I was an x-small/small, because I’m a tiny person. (Barely 5’3 and 100lbs.) 

He used the measurement tool they have to measure, but kinda eye-balled it from what I could tell. He couldn’t even repeat back what my actual measurement was.

Anyways, everything he tried to fit me with…hurt like hell. The Osprey Ariel 65l hurt the least, so I bought it. I keep feeling like the fit isn’t correct, even though this person is a pro and does this quite a bit. Is it possible this pack is too small for me? Even given my smaller physique?

backpacking,"Hi everyone. I have never used the MOLLE system. I have not traveled in a while, either. 

I used to look for wallet-sized pouches with belt loops as a way to carry my credit cards and keys in crowded cities. I found that a pouch closed with a zipper was more secure than pants pockets lacking zippers, and I found that although someone who wanted my stuff could snip the flimsy waist strap of a fanny pack they would not be able to saw through my belt without my noticing.

These days, every wallet-sized pouch I find seems to use the MOLLE system, which can attach to a belt with two short, snapping straps. Part of me worries that the snaps would not be as secure as the pouches I used to be able to find on which the straps were sewed on. ***My fear is that a snap could come undone or someone who wanted my stuff could unsnap the straps with a quick yanking motion and then abscond with my credit cards.***

In my searches, though, I have not seen any reviews of people complaining about MOLLE pouches falling off due to wimpy snaps. So maybe my fear has no rational basis? 

My use case of wanting to have some protection against pickpockets may be niche, though. I would love your thoughts about whether the average affordable MOLLE pouch has snaps that won't come undone simply from yanking? I know I could always sew the straps into place,\* but part of me wants to embrace the MOLLE system. It would be nice if the snaps were sturdy but not impossible to open--perhaps permitting me to remove the pouch if I loosened my belt and got my fingers underneath it but not requiring me to remove my belt entirely the way sewn-on straps would require me to do. ***What are the odds that the average MOLLE pouch would work in a way that fits that happy medium? If it's too hard to talk about the ""average"" MOLLE pouch, maybe you can recommend an affordable, wallet-sized MOLLE pouch with study, yank-resistant snaps?***

I would like to go hiking in Sweden this summer. The plan is to to set out a route which we do in the course of a week (or so) and sleep in a tent. We don't have a lot of experience hiking like this and walking for many day in a row, but I have done a fair amount of camping, and would consider myself relatively fit (I run quite a bit). 

 I originally wanted to do the Kungsleden trail, but my travel partner claims that it is difficult and dangerous and does not want go. What I have read so far is that the path relatively easy to find and easy to follow (not super difficult). Do you have any experience with doing the trail? 

Another alternative we were considering is the Siljanleden trail, which is most likely very beautiful as well, but just doesn't strike me as so special. Do you have any recommendations for other hiking trails in Sweden that are equally beautiful, but maybe a little less challenging than the Kungsleden trail?

Hello, myself and a few friends would like to stop in a rural small town in Germany on the way from Munich to Prague in order to break up the train ride, and experience a bit of the non city life Germany has to offer. We do not need an English friendly place as one of us speaks fluent german. We want to stop in one of the following towns, and thought that maybe somebody would have a recommendation.

backpacking,"From July 1-11 2021 I hiked solo from the northern to southern coast of Iceland. It was a fantastic hike – highly recommended for anyone who thinks they might want to try. I’m writing this report because I benefitted from reports by many others, yet my experience was different and hopefully will help people plan. Please be aware that this is long.

https://preview.redd.it/ho2m6ljh1o091.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfb6e4fcb1208c5c04b6445eda9e1589e97a7e47

I mostly followed the route in [BackpackingOkapi](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/9mxrak/we_traversed_iceland_on_foot_here_is_our_trip/). Their excellent trip report was a big help. I also benefitted from [KatieEndurance’s](https://katiejaneendurance.com/solo-iceland-traverse/) trip reports and interviews. [Lukasz Supergan](https://lukaszsupergan.com/crossing-iceland-traverse-the-route-and-preparations/) provides an invaluable discussion of routes and general issues hikers will encounter.   Andrew Skurka provides a comprehensive trip report and discussion on issues specific to Iceland on his website.  There are also many YouTube videos which give an insight into conditions.

I got lucky with the weather. I encountered no storms, no vicious winds, and instead it was unusually hot/sunny weather. As I write below the hot weather had one drawback: largescale flooding at the start of the trip as well as in the central highlands. The central highlands were closed to vehicles, and the paths/routes were often flooded, so no one was there. For my first four days in the highlands, I hiked alone, not seeing a vehicle nor footprints, in the most spectacular landscape.

**Gear and Food**: I had a typical ""near ultralight"" gear setup. My favourite item by far was my pair of merino wool-lined knee length waterproof socks. I wore those with trail runners and sock liners. That combo meant I could walk through most streams and rivers without stopping, and the socks kept me warm enough that I could wear shorts most days. I drank water directly from the rivers without any issues. My base weight was about 5kg.

Due to my back injury I wanted to keep food weight down, so I carried 2,350 calories per day with enough for 14 days and no resupply. In the end I finished early, and so the last few days I added to my calorie intake. I kept to a rule that all items had to provide at least 5 calories per gram so I had just under 7kg of food. A typical day was: 28g of whole milk powder, 20g of chocolate covered coffee beans, 3 energy bars, 75g of trail mix and 50g of chocolate. At dinner I heated 500ml of water and had a freeze-dried meal with a vitamin pill. I carried an additional 0.5-1kg of water at times.

In total my backpack with non-worn gear and two weeks of food at the start of the hike weighed approximately 12 kg.

I flew into Akureyri on June 30th and bought isobutane fuel at the petrol station near the airport, then hiked to my hotel.

**Daily Notes**

Please note I express distances in kilometers, with elevation in feet.

*Day 1 (41km) Glera River Valley*

I hiked 41km from Akureyri along the Glera river. The first 30km was asphalt road then it became a dirt road. It was hot: 18c and the winter snow was melting rapidly. The thaw water from the highlands drained along the steep cliffs lining the river valley, and the river was roaring and high. I came to one bridge where emergency utilities were examining it, fearing that it would be swept away. Towards the end of the day the river became narrow but deep and fast, with huge standing waves.

I had trouble finding a place to camp – you are not permitted to camp on private lands, and there were few suitable locations. I eventually camped beside a small clear stream that looked over the valley.

https://preview.redd.it/c1mxcgtzzn091.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b21d85ad9807587ca67db03405ced638ed7693b

*Day 2 (34km)* *Into the Highlands*

This was totally different from Day 1. I started out at 7am and within 100m hiking I came to a sign warning that from thereon only (Icelandic style) 4-wheel drives were permitted. The road immediately deteriorated and after walking another 2km there was a rope across the road and sign saying it was closed to all vehicles due to “thawing ground”. About 1 km later the road was flooded but walkable, then the road disappeared as several fast-moving streams wound ahead, one following the roadbed, but you couldn’t tell which. I walked up the bank by the steep hill sides and scrambled over boulders for 300 metres or so. At the end of all that was a fast stream of thaw water coming down from the mountains through a deep crevice. There were several streams through the boulders which could be safely crossed but it was not fun.

After passing that the road reappeared and the valley flattened out, but only briefly. Soon there was another set of boulders and more streams. This set was more difficult to pass and I scouted it for a while before selecting a route to cross, but I broke one trekking pole as I used it to pole vault over the rushing water.

I hiked a further 20km along the river – the whole time I was worried that I’d soon find an uncrossable tributary. At one point, in a narrow area, a large mound of icy snow covered the path and sloped from a cliff edge down to the river. I began walking along the boulder edge of the river, but it was too dangerous especially with a backpack, so I moved in by the cliff edge and clung to the ice, which was only a little better.

By mid-afternoon I reached the end of the river journey: trees disappeared and instead of grass and flowers there was just moss with rocks. There the path climbs 1500 feet to the central highlands plateau. I was happy to see the end of the river.

The highlands looked like a different planet. It was rolling low hills covered by boulders, soil, snow and large lakes of thaw water. I was intending to follow the F821 track, which is marked with yellow posts, but too much of the track was snow-covered or still flooded. I had to use GPS to find a route as the paths were largely invisible.

I didn’t see anyone all day.

https://preview.redd.it/cp2zh8iwzn091.png?width=2016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67e489641ce4060f74ca5c33b174bee947b96de2

*Day 3* *(35km) to F26*

I originally intended to hike towards Laugafell hut this day, but to get there I had to cross several rivers and I was concerned they would be uncrossable with the flooding. Further, as all vehicles were prohibited, I wasn’t even sure the huts would be open. So instead, I headed south east (using my gps, the track was still often submerged or covered in ice) and met up with the F881 track after 15km or so. It was truly beautiful scenery – rolling hills with thaw water lakes and large expanses covered in snow and ice. The farther east I went the less snow there was, and eventually the track was walkable. Then I saw fresh tracks from a vehicle - it had turned back due to snow/ice blocking the road. It was a relief to see some sign of life as it meant the road was now passable by the four wheelers at least - I’d been worried I would get stuck. I eventually got to the well-known F26 track and turned south. The scenery changed to fewer patches of snow and mostly moonscape - volcanic rock in all directions. The river crossings were all easy. It was warm again, but winds turned very strong - around 40mph- from the north. I saw no people all day and no footprints either.

*Day 4* *(35km)* *Past the Tungnafellsjokull glacier*

I started about 12km north of the Tungnafellsjokull glacier. I was making good time, so I decided to take the longer route south. Heading west would be more direct, but by travelling further southeast I could pass through the Vonarskaro valley which lies between the Vatnajokull glacier and Tungnafellsjokull glaciers. This is reputed to be one of the most beautiful regions in Iceland.

The first half day I followed my GPS to shorten the route overland. The terrain was mostly small rocks and volcanic “dust” which is easy to walk on. There were several odd huge channels where major rivers had been, but they weren’t marked on maps. I joined the tracks for the river crossings - the rivers were flooded but it was possible to find routes by foot after substantial scouting. I have waterproof socks up to the knees, but the water was higher at times and very cold.

When I got to the valley the views were spectacular. Vatnajokull is immense and has markings on it that look like large craters. Pictures don’t capture the scale nor panorama. Down lower the glaciers are mostly black but with odd white shapes. These form the walls on either side of the valley. The valley itself is very flat and is usually packed with small stones in a dark base as far as you can see. At other times there are meandering streams which have thick green moss growing on both sides (otherwise there’s no life). I camped in a spot overlooking the valley with a fast, glacial stream running beside me. I again didn’t see anybody all day.

https://preview.redd.it/o6nxw5mtzn091.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6dc159d2546f9dd45b67231cb80265d167627309

*Day 5* *(36km)* *Through the Vonarskaro valley*

This was a long day. I started in the Vonarskaro valley and reached a point where no 4x4s are permitted. They couldn’t have gone there anyway - there was a steep ice/snow/rock descent into the next part of the valley. The valley was now far wetter and with much more moss. The valley walls had a burnt reddish colour in places, along with a yellow/orange. All this was in the midst of the towering glaciers on either side.

After about 15k, and a third section of this valley, I climbed out to a lookout point showing a large impassable flooded river in front. I didn’t need to cross it, so headed west along a track leading to one of the main tracks that heads south. I got lost at one point and wasted three km (there was a track not marked on my map) but returned to the correct route and managed 34km for the day. That brought me to a beautiful place along the shores of lake Hagongulon.

I saw nobody all day.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g75ahyarzn091.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0623ce0fb32c360c15f0743f64f9c426228c7b04

*Day 6* *(48km)* *Lake Halgongulon*

So vehicles and people have appeared again!

I started hiking east along Lake Halgongulon for 10km, then turned north to rejoin the F26 track which I had left further north to visit the Vonarskaro valley. The track near the lake had been washed out by a major thaw and stream, so I was surprised to see a convoy of three very large 4x4s a few km after heading towards me. They were surprised to see me too. They said they were checking the roads and water crossings before opening roads. On the F26 two “dune buggy” type vehicles with guys wearing motorcycle helmets rocketed by (but they stopped to make sure I didn’t want a ride).

The geography returned to the lunar landscape but with some areas of grass and moss now. In the distance I could see the Hofsjokull glacier most the day. We had rain and low cloud, giving it all a different perspective. The next two days will be similar until I get to the mountainous southern region.

I finished at the point where roads were open. There’s a ranger’s hut where I camped - usually those are open with showers, a place to set up a tent, and the rangers tell you about conditions. But this one was closed and empty still. I set up my tent looking over a glacial river from Hofsjokull.

https://preview.redd.it/hofas1ymzn091.png?width=4032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12b9bc70226edca1cd2dd8e77a18309799f8dbb0

*Day 7 (46km) Lake Porisvatn*

Today I saw lots of vehicles. Icelanders are generally kind and serious people - like the Scandinavians - but on these dusty, dirt roads they roar by leaving a tornado of dust. It literally becomes opaque with dust for 4-5 seconds. The procedure is simple: I see a dust cloud rocketing towards me on the horizon, then as they get close, I move to the upwind side of the road, as they pass we smile and wave at each other, and then I’m lost in their suffocating cloud. I do wonder what they’re thinking about all this.

Out of 7-8 cars today, the first one stopped. It was two brothers taking a boy fishing. On their way back they said “of course” when I asked if they caught any. They have trout in the lakes.

The landscape was the same lunar desert today as yesterday, until the last 10km when some giant turquoise coloured lakes appeared. They are far more beautiful than the pictures, as the eye sees the long flat plane of blue while the camera just captures the two dimensional ribbon of it. One of the lakes, Porisvatn, ends in a dam. The massive structures and paved roads surrounding the dam are a sharp contrast to the otherwise natural beauty of the region.

I camped beside a beautiful small lake just past the dam.

*Day 8 (28km): Ladmannalaugar*

Well today I reached my first stop, Ladmannalaugar, in a national park. The ranger at reception looked at me and immediately asked where I had hiked from. She said I’d meet more people today than all week. The place has about fifty people visiting from all parts of Europe and the US. Tourists show up for day visits, to do local hikes, and to follow the 4 (leisurely) day hike called the Laugavegur trail. You can do it in two if you hike most the day - it is only 55km but lots of steep ascents and descents, and the ranger warned that there was 6km through snow, slush and ice en-route to the next campground.

I was pleased to leave the lunar landscapes and arrive at the giant, colourful hills with patches of snow dotted with large lava rocks, that make up the park.

https://preview.redd.it/cbgt25lhzn091.png?width=2016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74778d18c20565e486ec13787810e8ed37a2a17a

*Day 9 (39km) Emstrur*

Today was full of amazing scenery and variety. I started in Landmannalauger and completed three sections of the trail.

The first section began through a series of hot springs and thermal vents. The trail then climbed roughly 1200 feet into a “snow zone” amidst the clouds, and for roughly 8-10km there was only cloud, rock and snow. The trail then descended back down to open up in a spectacular view of lake Alftavatn where there are huts and a ranger. The final section was a long dismal slog through flat, black volcanic areas. The wind was strong causing a general haze. Luckily it was a northern wind - the people heading north needed goggles, or wrapped clothing over their heads to avoid getting the dust in their eyes and mouth.

I finished at huts called Emstrur - they are in a beautiful valley. Tomorrow I’ll complete the trail and start heading south near to the ocean.

https://preview.redd.it/4cw8oizezn091.png?width=2016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f00f5c0e9506904ff8dd4d7e233ab21dbd39665

*Day 10 and Day 11 (46 +7km) Skogar and the Ocean*

Day10 was long. I started out at 4:30am from Emstrur towards Porsmork (pronounced Thorsmork). This is a 15km hike that takes you from around 1700 ft elevation down to 800ft. It follows a large river and so, along the way, you climb up and down into gorges created by tributaries. As altitude declines everything gradually changes birch trees appear, many birds show up, colourful wild flowers bloom, bees and insects appear, and then the hike ends in a forest.

https://preview.redd.it/lovhzq3azn091.png?width=2016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72285c78e58b5dca5bba1f52374292d0608d8377

At Porsmork you are about 20km in a straight line to the ocean. However, being Iceland, there are two glaciers blocking the path. So, you need to start uphill once again on a very steep path reaching 3,500ft - there I hiked about 5-6km in snow with a beautiful mist of fog - and finally descend in a series of undulating hills (which would have been perfect with a toboggan in the snowy region) until you are down to 200-300 ft (Skogar).

This Porsmork-Skogar hike is sketchy as weather at the top changes fast and can make it unsafe, so it can be closed for days. But as I was leaving Porsmork around 9am the ranger told me it was perfect weather. There were plenty of people doing partial hikes along the way and the path is well marked. I met a couple from Colorado carrying mountain bikes - this was just before there are chains you hold onto when traversing a narrow cliff edge. Apparently, the wife found the hike listed as an epic mountain bike trail, and they were questioning it! (They did proudly ride past me near the end).

https://preview.redd.it/xuvy61b4zn091.png?width=2016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4811093704502d321ec3366ccec7bb997806468

That was 46km and as I descended to the town I booked a room in a converted residential school, now “hotel”, for the evening. On Day 11, in the morning, I walked 7km via the local waterfalls to the ocean, and that’s the end.

backpacking,"Hello everyone,

In my hurry to get to the ferry today I forgot an item in a hostel in Split that is quite silly, but important to me - a keyhanger of a stuffed bat toy. I am staying in Dubrovnik until Sunday morning at least and possibly until Monday morning. Is anyone traveling between these two cities the next two days and willing to bring this item with them? I think I can arrange for a friend to drop it off at a practical location in Split, and I can pick it up at the ferry port or main busstation.",Anyone traveling from Split to Dubrovnik in the next two days?

backpacking,"This is gonna be a long one, so bear with me here. My dad and I have made a goal to go backpacking on every continent (save Antarctica, probably) before he gets too old. We’ve already done parts of the Appalachian trail and are going to hike the Tour du Mont Blanc about a month from now, so I’m excited for that. This brings me to thinking about our next trip— Winter 2022 and Summer 2023 I already have things planned (spring and fall are unavailable as I am in college), which leaves winter 2023/2024 as the next available time slot. I’ve been looking for a good next destination in either Africa or Asia for a winter trip, but everything I’m finding is most advisable to do from April-October due to either crowds, weather or both. Are there any cool multi-day trails in either Asia or Africa (dad doesn’t want to do Aus/NZ just yet and we’ve kinda got our hearts set on Peru for South America, which is best done May-October) that would be good to take on during December/January? I do realize I’m thinking too far ahead and should probably just live in the moment, but this has been bugging me for a while. Thank you for reading my wall of text if you’ve gotten this far.

backpacking,"I'm planning a trip to both parks in 2023; planning to do some backpacking with friends in both. It's about a 9 hour drive between them, and I'm hoping to find somewhere we can stop for a day or two in between so we don't have to do that drive all in one shot. There's plenty of good nature in between, and I'm sure I could find something cool on Alltrails. Hopefully I can get a recommend from one of you fine folks for a good nature area to hike in either in western Montana or eastern Washington so I don't miss something particularly cool.",Anything cool in between Glacier national park and North Cascades I should stop at for a day or two?,,aDuckedUpGoose,,5,2022-05-17 21:57:00

backpacking,"What is physically stopping an individual from crossing the Canada/USA border while in the wilderness? I am not asking about the legality of this act, I am asking about the physical barriers to doing so. Obviously, this act is illegal.

If an individual is backpacking in the USA along the border with Canada and they are up in the mountains, who is stopping them from spending a few days in the Canadian wilderness before turning back and heading home? It would seem to me it would be very difficult to patrol all 5500 miles of the border, especially in areas of mountainous terrain.

Presumably, if you were stopped by some sort of National Park ranger you could simply state you have no ID and keep quiet about your citizenship. There are usually fees associated with backcountry campgrounds, so they could certainly ask you for proof of that, which you may or may not have.

Again, what is physically stopping someone from crossing these boundaries besides mountainous terrain?",Crossing International Borders While Backpacking,,stom57419,,20,2022-05-17 20:41:22

backpacking,"I’ve booked a trip to Europe from the final week of July to the first week of October, which’ll give me 74 days of travel, net of flying. I’ll be landing in Paris and leaving from Istanbul.

I’d ideally like to spend a good amount of time in France, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, Czechia, Italy, Croatia, Hungary and Turkey… and possibly do a few smaller trips to Belgium and Austria while I pass through.

Some context: I’ve solo travelled once before for a month in Nepal and Thailand prior to the pandemic. I loved it so much I’ve been extremely eager to book a trip since. I will be graduating University soon and have a few months off until I start my graduate job in the new year, so now is the perfect time. I also have a girlfriend whom I love very very much and unfortunately this trip will fall over an anniversary date for us. I know it is upsetting for her that I’ll be away over this period but I’m not sure I’ll get such an opportunity again and she’s supportive of me wanting to go.

Now: I have found that I can rebook my flights slightly earlier for cheap to make the anniversary but I would have to shorten it to 63 days travel time (only alternative is to pay through my neck). So what do I do?

I ask anyone with experience travelling the region: purely from a travel perspective, is it worth shortening my trip and will I still be able to do most of these places and enjoy them? Will 63 and 74 make the difference for that rough itinerary? Thanks for your help :)",Advice: should I shorten my euro trip?,,shroomyszn,,2,2022-05-15 13:36:37

so i am a 22 year old, and i am moving to Canada in 6 months for 6 months.

My current task is saving enough money to be able to sustain myself during those months, i will be staying with my boyfriend who is currently out there so i am not worried about accommodation.

information! -

I will be working two jobs, that equal to be around 60 hours and are £10 an hour. i know this sounds absurd, but i trust in myself that i can do this within the time frame allotted.

Now, the advice.

I am in the process of learning to drive and my test is in 3 months, but with this recent travel opportunity I'm  stuck on trying to complete driving within the 6 months saving period, or pause it entirely.

pausing it allows me to save extra cash, as learning will cost me an average of 240 a month. however, i worry i will lose a lot of driving knowledge and limit my end goal of £6000.

what should i do? pause driving? continue learning in the hopes i pass?

This trip is my main priority and i want to do everything in my power to reach my goals, but i also dont want to make too many ridiculous sacrifices.

But I've noticed when I take a couple weeks off of work or hiking/backpacking, the very first day I'm back I start to get knee pain after only a few hours.

I can get my knees back to normal, using a combination of dynamic stretching and warm ups in the morning, with static stretching in the evening, but it takes a few weeks. Even if I make sure I walk about a mile every day or so of that two week break, I still come back with knee pain. Just got to be something I'm missing.

backpacking,"Hi r/backpacking

A friend and I had a trip booked for the past several months to fly to Sri Lanka this coming Wednesday until 3rd June. We were planning on getting a train from Colombo to Ella, then renting a jeep and driving around the nation. Going between the mountains, to the beaches, into the jungles and everything in between. With the political unrest and declaration of state of emergency, I think we need to postpone the trip for later in the year until things stabilise.
Problem is now we cannot get a refund, so we need to buy last minute tickets somewhere. We’re flying from London so ideally direct flight of no more than 12 hours however we would consider 15 at a push. The budget was around £2k with jeep but now we need to fork out for tickets, I think that’s been significantly reduced. We really want to explore/travel, not have things booked out and see where the journey takes us.
I have travelled through India and SEA, ideally not anywhere in SEA but it could be an option, however my understanding is the COVID situation isn’t doing very well out there.
Anybody have last minute alternative suggestions for a budget of £2k with flights for 18ish days?

backpacking,"I've been rolling with a pair of Teva mid hiking boots that I bought going on a decade ago for...well...a decade. I typically got in one modest backpacking/hiking trip a year so they were lightly used for a long time and largely did the job. They're ""waterproof"" which at the time seemed like a great idea.   


Just did a quick weekend trip to Zaleski and got wrecked by rain. Alas, the waterproofing on the shoe which was always a little iffy is doing a far better job protecting the outside world from my...foot water...than the reverse. Plus the tread is getting fairly worn as I used them a fair amount for just walking around the neighborhood when it snowed.   


Long story short after dealing with chronic damp foot and losing my footing a couple times that thankfully didn't end tragically and merely embarrassingly it's time to look at new kicks.   


I'm typically around 250lb and have size 13/14 feet and shoe buying can sometimes be a bit of a nightmare. I'm open to moving away from boots to hiking shoes or even trail runners, but I tend to hike ""heavy"" though it's something I'm slowly working on addressing with new gear and just packing less stupidly. I really want to start getting far, far more trips in though and unlike the last pair (they were an outlet purchase at Backcountry....) I'm willing to invest much more into getting something best suited.   


I have an REI an hours drive away so it's not completely inconvenient to go and try some things on but I kind of also want to go into it with a bit more of an idea of what I'm looking for. I'm likely never going to be doing long through hikes or anything just because of time but I'd like to getting more miles in and feel a little more comfortable/surefooted doing so.

backpacking," 

I went backpacking this weekend, and tried trail runners for the first time: Merrell Antora 2.

Trail runners are not going to work for me, and I need ankle support. We only did two 1-mile days and one 12-mile day, so it was a light trip. But my ankles are killing me now, and I could feel it on the trip.

In addition to the ankle support, the shoe was too tight on the toebox (pushed on the side against my big toe; was fine lengthwise, size 5, only tapped a little downhill, but not a ton of pressure) and too roomy in the heel (blister on the outsides of my heels from slipping.)

Any recommendations on where to look next for boots? Altra's were recommended for a roomier toe box; but Hoka's were also recommended as a supportive shoe that would be good for me; but these seem to be totally opposite as far as hiking boots go.

Mompiche seems to be dirt cheap when it comes to renting space, like $200-600 per month for gorgeous beachside space but it doesnt seem like the type of town with good cell service or wifi either.

While choosing the next destination is always fun, we find ourselves taking a day deciding, comparing prices, travel combinations, etc. We usually make good decisions or at least are comfortable with those we've made. However, there is a component of stress specially when you are trying to get the forward ticket just before boarding :)

When I was working, it was nice to call amex travel, tell them what I needed and have them sort it out. During snow storms, if my trip was canceled, I'd call them to get a refund and I'd book a train.

backpacking,"I'm planning a month backpacking, camping, and hut-hopping in the white mountains (YAY!).  My go-to for trail meals has always been dehydrated premade stuff (back in the day, I subsisted on the dreaded RichMoore stuff, boy do I have stories).  I'm older and wiser now, and before I go to Amazon and say ""GIMME FOOD FOR A MONTH"", I ask the collective wisdom about trail food.

This trip is basically going to be a mix of 3 experiences.  First is carcamping in my jeep (also called Overlanding).  I have a full kitchen there, so that's easy to stock.  Another phase will be hut-hopping in the whites, which depending on timing may require me to bring my own food (the huts are in self-service mode still, so I need to carry my own stuff).  The last will be true backpacking stuff, sleeping in leantos and carrying everything on my back.

I can manage the carcamping.  But I don't know what the current wisdom for backpack food is.  Do I buy peanut butter, energy bars, ramen, and electrolyte balancers and just push through the days on the trail?  Or should I trust that MOuntain House won't let me starve, and fork out the $10/meal for their stuff?

Some personal details - I'm not a young high energy type.  I'm Old, I plan on doing 6-12 miles a day (maybe ramping up later), and if I don't get enough calories, I turn into a raving asshole (ask my partner).

Some things I'm considering - I've used Soylent int he past and I'm pretty happy with it.  They have a decent mocha meal replacement that seems pretty good.  A previous trip or two I've done traditional dehydrated meals, and they've been fine, but seem overly expensive.

backpacking,"My girlfriend and I are planning a six day trip to Maine at some point in June-July. 

We are bringing our 6 year old German Shepard Luna who is very comfortable on rugged terrain and can comfortably climb class 3 features but will stay behind at a day kennel when needed. We are both fit and experienced backpackers and are hoping to get some suggestions for day hikes, overnights, and must sees in the state. We plan on climbing Katahdin if we can get the permits and then working our way back down to Acadia. 

I haven’t been to Acadia since I was a kid but do remember it wasn’t the most challenging terrain and trails were often short. I was hoping for some ideas for tying those iconic shorter hikes together to get the most out of our days. My partner and I are comfortable with exposure, technical terrain, and long days.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Note: this is my first backpacking trip so many of these items are not UL,  however, I've been training and am comfortable carrying 30-60lbs for 5-7 mi per day on various types of terrain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am probably bringing way too many items with me on my first multi-day backpacking trip, but keep in mind I have been training with these items in my pack for the last month on difficult terrain so weight is not my main priority. I am in great shape and am able to comfortably hike with the current list. I am open to any suggestions on dropping items from the list, or items I should replace /add. Any information is greatly appreciated.

Hello,

I'm backpacking for the first time in a month. I'm going to SE Asia for 1.5 months alone, and I'm wondering how much planning should go into it. I've seen a variety of advice. Some say I should just go there and wing it, while others say I should have much more of it planned. What's your advice? Is now a good time to backpack in SE Asia in general? Are there still alot of restrictions/is it mostly empty of backpackers?

If I do arrive there without a plan, how easy is it to couch surf &amp; find tour guides/hostels on the spot? Thank you very much for all the help :)",How much planning should go into SE Asia backpacking?,,drbeethoven100,,4,2022-05-07 17:50:09

I speak fluent Spanish (i definitely pass as an Argentinian), English, Italian and some Portuguese. I did some short term travels through Europe, and some backpacking solo in Perú, and I used to live in buenos aires so I have some street smarts. I am looking forward for a warm (it doesn't have to be tropical, but not Scandinavia), moderately cheap destination, with a good backpackers scene (I don't want to end up in a place mostly visited by couples) for my next trip. I prefer destinations that have a good mixture of nature (i love hiking), history, and hitting the beach would be nice as well. My budget for the whole trip (not including flights) is around 3k Usd. I mostly tend to stay in hostels, and eat cheap food but I do not skip on activities, and I am willing to take flights if they significantly cut travel time. I have approximately one month of vacation (I could potentially extend it up to 40 days), and I am extremely flexible on when to leave, I would prefer traveling to escape the winter in Europe.

I'm debating between some different destinations: either Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia, or the gringo trail in Central America, or Colombia (i'm really concerned about safety tho, I am pretty anxious and I don't want to spend the whole time on hedge because I feel like my safety is at risk), or the Philipines.

backpacking,"TL;DR is you're an inreach user, are there features of the inReach mini that are tethered to phone app use and what are they? Or can it be used 100% standalone with 100% of the advertised feature set 100% of the time?  Do non-garmin using family members need a Garmin app to utilize any features?

&amp;#x200B;

Got the Zoleo a few weeks ago as I saw that for an extra $6/mo for the locationshare+ which is unlimited check-ins with GPS and breadcrumb trail.  And I liked that the Zoleo has physical buttons.

My goal was to not have bluetooth turned on on my phone so that I could have longer battery life for periods where I wanted to use the phone for navigation, but to send automatic check-ins at regular intervals when doing higher risk activites (which is what the location share+ advertises).

However, in practice, nothing except the manual check in works without the app and the recipient has to have the zoleo app as well to receive any of the additional visibility, messages, and features, you cannot start a location share+ session, then turn off BT on your phone, and have it send the updates.

How does this compare to the Garmin?  I have about a week left where I can still return (with a restocking fee but oh well).

For activity recording I use a Garmin watch, for GPS I use Garmin and Gaia.

Given that check-ins without the app are manual only, with the Zoleo that really turns it into almost exclusively an SOS device and neuters the Location Share + plan option, which also means it's no longer a value/savings (as the comparable volume for things such as breadcrumb and check-in volume came with a higher cost Garmin plan which skewed the number in the Zoleo's favor of a 5yr life cycle.) (25/mo for the garmin for high use months and 12 for low use months vs 26/mo for Zoleo and 4 for no use months, so feature wise even at $26/mo if I have to use the app, considering I'm too lazy to do that I have to compare to the low-cost Garmin plan which means after 2.5yrs the Garmin is a better value and I'd get to use it 12mo/yr.

BUT if the Garmin is also tethered to the app for any functions it's not worth the effort for me to take the additional cost/loss in returning the Zoleo.",(Another) InReach Mini vs Zoleo question (From a new Zoleo owner) What can and can't you do easily without the app on the InReach Mini?,,Marty_McFlay,,8,2022-05-07 07:50:19

backpacking,"Hiya everyone! I’m a 27F traveling to Australia from Canada on a Working Holiday Visa in the beginning of September. I’m having a hard time deciding what luggage would be the most practical that I should take with me 


I narrowed it down to either A) 28inch suitcase as checked luggage, and small duffle bag and backpack as my carry on OR B) 75-85l rucksack as checked luggage, and 22inch suitcase and backpack as my carry on


Whenever I go on vacation, I would always take a suitcase with me, however I would be staying in the same location for most of the time. I like the convenience of a rucksack but would 75-85l be a decent size for traveling for 1-2 years?! (Im 5’5/130lbs if that helps to picture how the rucksack would look on me)   


I do plan on moving around Australia, and will be backpacking Southeast Asia for a few months during that time. I am not a minimalist packer but I can try to cut down on my clothing items (which would probably take up the most room) to save some space. A suitcase can hold more, and the weight won’t be on your back but it is quite bulky to wheel around all the time .. and it’s much heavier than a rucksack


Any advice on what would be better option A) or B) would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks xx !!",Rucksack or suitcase for Working Holiday Visa Australia?? Which is more convenient?,,Significant-Yam3997,,17,2022-05-05 19:38:34

I’m looking to get into wilderness backpacking with a few overnights before hopefully doing Laugavegur in Iceland later this summer (3-6 days depending on pace and where I stop). It would be my third visit to Iceland and has been a goal for a long time. I will be tent camping the whole way. 

I’m a big dayhiker and have a well worn pair of Salomon Ultra 3 GTX Mids, but I’m considering picking up a new pair of footwear for this summer. Most reviews of Laugavegur say trail runners or low shoes are fine, and to focus on quick dry over goretex, but I wanted to see opinions here, especially because *backpacking* footwear is new to me. 

The way I see things I have 3 options: a low hiking shoe, either GTX or not, probably the Arc’teryx Aerios (I’ve already tried it and like the fit); keep the Salomons and hope I don’t get swamped; or go for a backpacking boot. I’m leaning Aerios — would certainly be better for hiking in my hot and humid home, but not sure if I’m underselling the stability of a boot for a first timer.",Beginner backpacker - boots or shoes?,,DrSnowballEsq,,18,2022-05-05 12:36:36

I'm about to head off to about 5 weeks walking the route to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, Spain. I'll be starting in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. Total distance is roughly 800km. I'm not religious, but this pilgrimage is open to all.

My backpacking experience is limited, so I tried my best to research &amp; pack as little as possible, while not facing a pinch some way down the road.

The clothes are either Merino wool or synthetic, hence light and quick-drying. Total weight (without shoes) is 8.5kg, or a little under 19lbs. I'll be wearing one set of clothes since I don't plan on going naked, so it'll weigh a little less effectively. I decided to ditch one of the two hoodies in the photo (the black one on the bottom), and keep the thicker one, I think that should do (this being Northern Spain, it can get chilly).

I'm super psyched to be going, let me know your thoughts!

They will be driven around to some sites, but also have to backpack in to some locations.  I've been to  Iceland once (not camping) so I know that even in summer, crummy weather and high wind are par for the course!

The Nemo Dagger OSMO 2P looks like a decent compromise  in weight and size.  Never heard of the brand since I haven't been  shopping for gear in years and have usually cheaped out on Eureka for  myself.

Thoughts on Nemo tents in general and this model in particular for rain and wind resistance and durability?  Especially wind!

I'll  probably make a fitted polytarp groundsheet for it, but I'll bet the  bottom of the tent will be challenged plenty with pokey rocks/gravel.

backpacking,"so uh, hi

I recently booked a flight to Colombia (I'll be arriving in Bogota) from the 8th of June to the 21st of July, which roughly translates to around six weeks. Not that long, but I guess it's enough to see the hightlights?

Anyways, I'm a 19 year old guy from Belgium and I'm traveling with a 21 year old guy from the US. He has no experience backpacking and I have pretty much no experience either (I've only backpacked part of southern Turkey and Romania/Bulgaria). My spanish is pretty basic but I understand pretty much about 3/4 of what Spanish speakers say. I've learning the language for about 2 hours a day and next week I'll be leaving for Tenerife where I hope to practice my speaking skills and my knowledge in general. 

So like I said, 42 days with a budget of about 43 euros a day, which translates to about 180 000 COP. Our travelling style is pretty much low budget and trying to chase the local way of living. Hostels, streetfood, local transport interspersed with an activity and some nights out now and then. 

Apart from that, uh, we have no plan. We figured we'd just go with the flow and see where it takes us. I'd love to do both the Guajira as the Pacific coast too, since those aren't on the gringo trail. I'm absolutely obsessed with Colombian culture and music and apart from the occasional partying, I'm just really looking forward getting to interact with locals! I'm pretty open-minded in pretty much everything so any advice is really welcome. Bogota, Medellin, Tayrona, Cali and the classic spots are ofc included in the notreallyitinerary-itinerary.

You may ask yourself, why tf did I read this shit? Well, like I said, it's our first time backpacking and I'd just really love to get some tips and tricks, questions and advice from you guys (if u want).

## Pre-Trip Tips: Important Facts About Traveling to Morocco

## What to expect in Morocco

What images come to you when you think of Morocco? Probably the ones that show the lifestyle of the Arabian Nights to perfection, right? Yes, you can definitely expect this when you travel to Morocco. But: Morocco is much more than that. It is a country that tends to be modern and is developing at a great speed.

## The following three things make this country so special:

· Oriental atmosphere: it starts with the colorful markets, continues through the typical cuisine to the hammams and wonderful hotels (riads): in Morocco, you can soak up the oriental way of life from dawn to dusk.

· Landscape: From the Atlas Mountains to gigantic canyons, from the desert to the mountain passes, the landscapes of Morocco will take your breath away. We had high expectations before, but we must admit it: it was even better!

· Geographical proximity to Europe: you are in a completely different world just a few hours from continental Europe. No stressful jet lag, no long-haul flight. An ideal travel destination for anyone who doesn't want to travel too far.

## Best time and season to travel to Morocco

You can travel to Morocco all year round, but of course, there are months that are better and others less suitable. It also depends on the regions of Morocco you want to go to. From Tangier to Dakhla, there are several seasons that separate them...

The ideal travel periods for a round trip through Morocco are spring (if possible avoid the holiday season and autumn. Although it can still be cool in Europe in the spring, you can usually expect a radiant sun in Morocco. In the autumn, you can also enjoy beautiful late-summer days in Morocco. We would not recommend the middle of summer (July and August), especially if you want to see the desert. In addition, sandstorms in the desert begin to prepare between April and October. At 35 degrees in the shade, sightseeing might become uncomfortable. Restrictions are to be expected during Ramadan, as some restaurants are closed during the day.

Around Christmas and New Year, many flee to the scorching sun and there are many people in Morocco and therefore more expensive. If you want to avoid this, you need to take this into consideration as well.

We traveled to Morocco in late February/early March. It was delightfully warm during the day, occasionally even rather hot in the sun. ICa cooled down in the evening. Our accommodations were all equipped with heating. Our advice: during the colder months, be sure to find rooms with heating, otherwise, the nights will be rather uncomfortably cold.

## Arrival tips: enter Morocco

Good news: the French do not need a visa to enter the country. On the plane, you will receive an entry card that you will have to fill out. The border police will take the card and can ask you some questions. That's all.

You can expect the same procedure when you leave. Anyone working in journalism or another field that could be a thorn in the side of the police should prepare for a slightly longer question-and-answer game. But overall, it's relatively relaxed, so don't worry! Moroccans are very welcoming and open-minded.

## What to bring back from Morocco?

It is very difficult to choose what to buy in Morocco, it is a destination to make purchases. In fact, the majority of visitors to this country, go there mainly to make purchases. The wide variety and quality of its handicrafts such as carpets, ceramics, leather goods, jewelry, textiles, etc., attract millions of tourists every year.

Among all the typical products of Morocco, craftsmanship occupies a very important place. Remember that negotiation is mandatory, as it is part of the idiosyncrasy of the country. While it can be exhausting, negotiation is a national tradition that is impossible to avoid. However, rest assured, if you want to get Moroccan brand products of natural and organic cosmetics combining health, quality, efficiency, pleasure, and elegance. You will always have the opportunity to buy online products designed in an artisanal way using noble and high-quality raw materials.

## Guide to accommodation in Morocco: where to stay?

Traditionally, we spend the night in Morocco in riads or standard apartments. Riads are traditional multi-story buildings with a beautiful courtyard and often a large roof terrace. From the outside, it is often hard to believe what oasis is hidden behind the doors of a riad.

Nowhere else in the world have we seen such a density of grandiose and elegant accommodation as in Morocco. In big cities, you are literally overwhelmed by offers. If possible, we strongly recommend staying in a riad. For about 70 to 100 euros per night, you can have a very nice room with breakfast for two people.

## Eating and drinking in Morocco

In Morocco, people love the combination of sweet and salty, and dried dates, apricots, and raisins are used in many dishes. Honestly, we're big fans!

Typical of Morocco is tagine, a dish that is prepared in a clay pot (also called tagine) and is often served with couscous. This stew is normally made with meat and vegetables, although there are vegetarian variations as well.

Although we liked Moroccan cuisine, to be honest, the culinary offerings have become a bit boring over time. Especially for vegetarians, you will find the same dishes served, because the choice is unfortunately rather limited unless you eat in trendy restaurants. Meat is often eaten in Morocco, unfortunately, vegetarian dishes are less present on the menu than in some other countries.

An exception is a breakfast, which is almost always very rich in bread and carbohydrates. Breakfast is included in most accommodations. Various meals, such as Moroccan pancakes, bread, jams, and homemade yogurt, will virtually always be offered.

## Religion and Culture: Clothing and Behavioral Tips in Morocco

As is known, Islam is the state religion in Morocco. Knowing in advance will help you adapt more quickly to this cultural difference.

We therefore particularly recommend that women do not wear clothes that are too narrow. Loose blouses, long pants, and long dresses and skirts are more practical. Honestly, as a tourist, you already stand out right away so it's more pleasant to be dressed as covered and casual as possible.

There is no obligation to wear a scarf, but we must admit it: even in the sun, we like to use cloth. The exchange of tenderness in public is prohibited in Morocco.

Good to know: Non-Muslims can only visit two mosques in Morocco: the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca and the Moulay Ismail Tomb Mosque in Meknes. But don't worry: there are beautiful quranic palaces and schools in Morocco that you can visit.

## Security: How safe is Morocco to travel?

One of the questions we were asked most often: is it safe to travel to Morocco? First of all, we advise you to read the section of the office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of your home country. In terms of security, this should always be your first point of contact.

However, we will of course also be happy to share our own personal experiences and this is where the good news comes in. Nothing bad ever happened to us in Morocco. We have not had any negative experiences. We were not robbed or harassed. Yes, we probably paid too much for some things, but that's about it.

## Our specific safety tips:

Travel as a couple if possible. Of course, there are also many who travel alone in Morocco – including women. To be honest, we personally found it very pleasant to travel as a couple.

Avoid the medina at night. Some cities' medinas (old towns) are made up of extremely small streets. Especially at night, these dark alleys can seem a bit shady. Try to avoid night walks. We recommend it to women traveling alone.

Don't spread out your valuables. We are usually the kind of people who are often too lazy to safely store our (rather expensive) photo equipment and let it hang freely around our shoulders. Apparently, you shouldn't make it a habit, especially in the crowd.

Don't be fooled by self-proclaimed guides. At every corner of Marrakech, someone will offer to show you the way to ""La Place"" (the large square). In truth, he wants to take you to his shop to sell you something, or he really shows you the place and of course charges you a good sum. Our advice: if you really get lost, it's better to ask a woman the right way.

Cities vs. Rural: We have personally found that men in big cities (especially in Marrakech) are much more intrusive and uncomfortable than in rural areas. While, for example, tips are constantly requested in cities (e.g. for photos), people in the countryside are much more reluctant about it. Which is normal in itself.

## Transport Guide: Road Trip through Morocco by car

Morocco is a really great place to travel by rental car. There are several reasons for this:

· First and foremost, the principal thoroughfares are in generally good condition. Most places are easily accessible even with a tiny automobile.

· Traffic is very limited outside the big cities. You may not see any other cars anywhere.

· We drive on the right in Morocco, so you don't have to get used to it (unless you're from New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, or other Commonwealth countries)

· Most places are marked in two languages (English, Arabic).

· The prices of a rental car are relatively cheap: for our Peugeot 301, we paid about 250 euros (excluding the navigation system) for a week.

## Renting a car in Morocco – what should I pay attention to?

## Provider and franchise

What does a franchise mean? In some countries, this is also called the ""deductible"" or ""deposit"". For example, if you break into a car, you will be reimbursed for any additional costs caused by this accident. However, if you book the rental car ""with deductible/deductible/deposit"" (this is the case of many other platforms), you have to pay a certain amount (usually a few hundred euros) in case of damage, which you lose.

## Is it safe to cross Morocco with a rental car?

Honestly, we had our hesitations at first, but it was absolutely not a problem! The streets are mostly in very good condition. There is little traffic. We have never met any dubious people. We only avoided driving at night, but mostly because it's easy to miss a pothole.

## Other tips for renting &amp; driving in Morocco

We are happy to rent the car ourselves at the airport, as there is usually less traffic than in the city's train stations and you can get used to the traffic conditions with peace of mind. We picked up our car in Marrakech on the day of departure for two reasons: first, you don't need a car in Marrakech, so we were able to save money. Secondly, as soon as you drive towards the medina, the traffic is appalling. We didn't want to do that to ourselves.

We bought a navigation device (GPS), but we would not recommend it. It was quite expensive and we didn't find much benefit in having it. Also, we couldn't find many places in the navigation system and had to trust our own orientation or the travel guide map. We recommend that you better download an offline app for your smartphone. It makes a lot more sense.

An International Driving Permit is usually not required when renting and we have never been asked for it. Nevertheless, we recommend that you get one only for insurance reasons. You can easily get your International Driving Permit in France.

In big cities, you need to avoid the car, which saves you time and stress. It's better to park the rental car as close to the hotel as possible. (e.g. in a guarded car park or at best in the hotel car park) and switch to taxis for the duration of the stay or walk distances.

## Police checks in Morocco

Many stories circulate on the Internet, it is the police checks in Morocco: Yes, it's true. They are everywhere and you may be checked if you travel to Morocco in your own car.

Our personal experience: We have never had a negative experience with the Moroccan police. Even when we were stopped after crossing a stop line during an overtaking maneuver, the policeman was very understanding (""French motorhomes are always slow, I understand that"").

## Urban transport in Morocco: Tips for taxis

Even in the big cities (Marrakech, Fez, Casablanca, etc.), you can do most of it by walking. For long distances, it is common to take a taxi. A fundamental distinction is made in Morocco between Petit Taxi (red) and Grand Taxi.

· The Petit Taxi (small taxi) is – as its name suggests – a very small car that can cross narrow streets.

· Longer distances are usually covered by a Grand Taxi, i.e. between two cities or for destinations slightly outside the city.

The fare is usually determined by a taximeter, but of course, they will try to convince you that it is not currently working. Therefore, you should either ask another driver or negotiate the fare in advance if they are trying to do the ""taximeter thing"" to you.

Prices vary from city to city – depending on people's habit of tourism. In Marrakech, for example, you can expect a short-distance ride to cost a few dirhams or more. You should, however, only pay a maximum of 30 dirhams. In Casablanca, we often paid only 20 Dirhams for a longer distance. Plus, you can expect extra at night.

## Travel expenses: how much does it cost to travel to Morocco?

## Currency &amp; Payment in Morocco

The currency of Morocco is the Moroccan dirham (MAD). 1 euro corresponds to about 10.70 dirhams (early 2021). With prices written in Morocco, you simply mentally omit a zero at the end to get the approximate amount in euros.

You can easily withdraw money from ATMs.

## Travel budget in Morocco: price level and price examples

How much does it cost in Morocco...?

· 70-100 Euros per night for a double room in a lovely riad in Marrakech

· Car rental for one week: 200 to 250 Euros

· A taxi ride in Marrakech or Fez costs between 20 and 30 dirhams.

· 200 Dirhams for a great restaurant dinner for two.

· Entrance to the Majorelle Gardens in Marrakech: 80 Dirhams

· Entrance to the Bahia Palace in Marrakech: 50 Dirhams

We would describe the price levels in Morocco as slightly lower than in France. But don't expect to make a super cheap trip to Morocco.

## Tipping culture

Tipping is not only considered desirable in Morocco for many services but it is actually expected. In restaurants, 5 to 10 percent is appropriate. We would also leave the service staff of our accommodation about 10 to 20 Dirham per day in the room.

If you ask for directions or take a picture of someone, they may also be asking you for money. We would then give about 10 to 20 Dirhams.

## Photography Tips and Restrictions in Morocco

Morocco is a paradise for photography enthusiasts. And yet, there are a few things to consider: Especially if you want to take pictures of people (and Moroccans are really photogenic), you should always ask permission. In big cities where people are used to tourists, you will almost always be asked to tip if you want to take pictures of someone.

An extreme example is the Djemaa el Fna square in Marrakech. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of people who make a living as photographers. Unfortunately, you are often asked for money here, in a not too kind approach.

It should be borne in mind that in Islam, the depiction of people is forbidden or not welcome. You should keep this restriction in mind when taking photos, especially if you are in very religious areas. If in doubt, we do not recommend taking a photo and withdrawing rather than attracting attention.

Under no circumstances should you photograph military installations and uniformed officers (police, security guards, etc.).

## Internet and applications to travel to Morocco

## Mobile Internet: SIM card in Morocco

Most of us are accustomed to being online while traveling these days. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you buy a local SIM card for your smartphone when you go there. It's a great way to navigate from A to B and can also be used to look for tips on restaurants or sights.

The SIM card can be purchased at the airport. It is critical that your smartphone is network unlocked. (i.e. not limited to a single provider). The SIM card is usually configured and activated directly by the staff – without any problems. The price will depend on the volume of data, but as a rule, SIM cards are quite cheap.

However, in the cities themselves, the reception is excellent.Also, WiFi is quite widespread in Morocco: the vast majority of hotels offer WiFi. However, the speed leaves something to be said.

## Useful apps for your trip to Morocco

· Google Translate (download the French version to be able to use it offline): especially in rural areas, you will find that many speak little or no English, but rather speak French.

· maps.me or CityMaps2Go (download the map of Morocco so you can also use it offline): perfect for marking individual sites and restaurants.

· Maps (iPhone) or Google Maps application: ideal for navigating from A to B.

· Happy Cow: ideal for finding vegetarian restaurants nearby.",How to prepare and plan your trip to Morocco: the complete guide,,Mortraveling,,2,2022-05-01 12:12:45

Pretty new to the backpacking world: I have done plenty of car camping, and plenty of hiking on trail as well as off trail land nav.

Looking to do my first true backpacking trip soon, going solo: It is going to be about 11 miles on an in and out trail (5.5 miles in, 5.5 miles back), with a primitive camp site at the end of the trail. The trail is pretty flat, with about 200 feet elevation gain each way, so I am not worried about  this trip being too strenueous.

My current sleeping gear is not backpacking friendly: It is an 8 person tent and is huge and heavy.

I do have a hammock (a basic one from amazon) that I have set up before when car camping just for lounging pourposes, but never slept in. The weather will be in the low 60s at night when I go. With that said, what are my options for this warm weather to sleep in? Do i need an underquilt? Or can I get away with a sleeping pad and my cool weather sleeping bag (40 degree rated).

&amp;#x200B;

Every year, Marrakech attracts thousands of tourists from all over the world. Some come to spend only the weekend thanks to the relatively short duration of flights from Europe and the Middle East, while other travelers choose to have longer breaks in Marrakech during their visits. around the imperial cities of Morocco.

As a tourist city, Marrakech is not very different from the tourist cities of the world. There are a number of Marrakchis or people from other regions who seek to exploit tourists for their financial gain. This article is not intended to list the innumerable beauties of Marrakech but rather it is a guide that aims to expose some of the scams that a tourist can be exposed to and to help you avoid them and stay safe during your stay in Marrakesh.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Keep your valuables away from the eyes of thieves**

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the concerns of many travelers, theft is not a big problem in Morocco.

In the medina of many large cities in Morocco (Marrakesh, Fez, Tangier, Casablanca as in the large cities of the world), there is a history of petty crime, particularly in the form of theft of valuables such as wallets, camcorders, and smartphones.

Therefore, as a tourist, it makes sense to be aware of your situation at all times and to keep your valuables away from the eyes of potential thieves. Secret and multi-pocket belts are a great way to keep your cash close at hand. Also, it is recommended to keep hold of all bags and cameras. It's best to leave any valuables you don't need to be locked away in your hotel room.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. False guides in Marrakech**

&amp;#x200B;

Fake Marrakech guides come in different disguises, from young schoolchildren to well-dressed gentlemen. Fake guides and scammers tend to pounce on travelers who seem lost or newly arrived.

But in recent years, an increased police presence (thanks to the tourist brigade) has removed many bogus guides from the city.

The false guide often approaches in a very friendly manner. He walks by your side as he begins to engage in conversation. With his background, he looks like he wants to be your friend, at first asking innocent questions like “How long have you been in Marrakech? "". These questions are to gain as much information as possible to find out if you are new to Marrakech and unfamiliar with Marrakech and its surroundings.

He will ask you “where are you from?”. Often he will have a cousin/aunt/uncle/friend who lives there. He may also tell you that he wants to improve his speaking skills and asks you to talk with him while walking. It sounds quite innocent, yet has a very dark side.

They'll tell you they don't want the money. They will show you souvenir shops that belong to “a family member or a friend”, that is where they make their money. Merchants give them commissions on every tourist who comes and buys.

Once you've served your purpose for them and they decide they've taken you as far as they want to go, they'll give you directions to where you want to go next. Unfortunately, some fake guides will do this simply to switch you over to another fake guide as part of a scammer circuit.

• How to avoid this scam: If you need information or an official guide, contact the tourist office at +212 5 24 38 52 61, otherwise give the impression that you know where you are going and the route you should take, and politely decline all offers of assistance. Go with a plan of where you want to go and don't let anyone deviate from your itinerary. If you are being harassed by an unofficial guide, saying seriously that you will seek help from the police is also a way to dissuade them from their continued approach.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **The henna tattoo**

&amp;#x200B;

If you decide to have a henna tattoo, make it clear exactly what you want and where you want it on your hand. Henna ladies have a habit of very quickly extending their designs to your arm and asking for payment for the extra work.

Even if you haven't actually asked for a tattoo, don't get too close to these ladies, especially in the Jamaa El Fna. They will try to use their henna syringes unnoticed, offer to fix that mistake by giving you a full henna tattoo, which surely won't come for free. The result and the quality may vary but in general, the tattoo will be of a low quality.

After they have finished, they will ask for sums of 100DH (€ 10) for the few minutes it took them to complete the task. They won't care if you like the end result or not.

• How to avoid this scam: beware of covered women who try to approach you on Jemaa El-Fna. And even when it's too late, pay only in coins (no more than 10DH is a fair price) if you like the tattoo, or just don't let them “hide” the henna stain. Remember: you don't have to give money for a service you didn't ask for.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Sellers**

&amp;#x200B;

All tours (official or not) will no doubt stop at a carpet or pottery shop where the owners will delight you with their hospitality and give you free mint tea. Then they will give you a demonstration of how the rugs/ceramic items are made.

Eventually, they will use their sales tactics, including their lies about the high quality of their products and that they are antiques, in order to get you to buy their items.

• How to avoid this scam: Politely decline the mint tea and even if you end up taking it, remember that it was given as a gift and you have no real obligation to buy anything you do not want. If you liked their products, then you had to negotiate the price. Negotiation is a culture in Morocco, you must master it if you do not want to be ripped off by sellers. Avoid shopping in tourist places like the medina. Prefer stores in town (mainly Gueliz) that offer fixed prices.

&amp;#x200B;

5. **Taxi drivers**

&amp;#x200B;

It is illegal not to use the meter in a town taxi (petit taxi) and yet most taxi drivers will do anything to negotiate a price with you and refuse to turn the meter.

Things come to a boil when some taxi drivers ask for an extra bribe (tip), even after being rude and providing poor service. The worst? They will constantly harass you until you give up.

• How to avoid this scam: if a taxi driver approaches you, whistles to get your attention, he is 100% a crook, do not take his taxi. Find a taxi whose driver has not done the above things. Open the front door but don't go upstairs until you ask if he's going to turn the meter. If he accepts, tell him your destination. Then get in the car and make sure he turns the speedometer, otherwise say you're going to get off if he doesn't turn it. Some drivers agree to turn the meter on at first, then say the meter doesn't work, or just try to ignore you once you start moving. So be firm! If you can't find someone who will turn the meter, which is likely, negotiate. Most prices are between 7 and 15 dirhams.

&amp;#x200B;

**Car rental agencies**

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, there are also scams made by some car rental agencies, international and local, especially at the airport.

The “hidden stripe scam” is the most common. When taking the rental car, the agent makes a very brief and quick inventory. On the way back, the car rental agent makes a very long and in-depth inventory. He can even lie down on the floor to check the underbody. Of course, he will find a scratch. He knew his location. Even if you pointed out that during the first inventory, you did not lie down on the ground to check the sills, his answer will be: “You should have! "". Lo and behold, you'll pay extra for a lick of polish that it won't even go through so you can rip off future customers with the same scratch.

• How to avoid this scam: make a very thorough inventory to check if the car has scratches, bumps, or scratches and report them. Do not forget that without a report, it is impossible to know if you are not responsible for these damages. Compare what is on the contract with what is displayed on the dashboard of the vehicle, to avoid any over-billing caused by conflicting information.

Luckily, there aren't many of these scammers. Moroccans and in particular Marrakchis are known for their generosity and kindness. This guide is only intended to show you how to get out of it in case you come across one of these scammers. We wish you a peaceful stay in Marrakech.

Immensity for the horizon, silence for background music, nature in its raw state for an only companion... Staying in the desert is one of those fascinating experiences that we all (or almost) want to live one day. But what is the reality of this dream? How, very concretely, does such a journey take place? Answer to all the questions - practices and others - on the way back from Inara Camp, in the Agafay desert, in southern Morocco.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Is the desert far away?**  
Yes, normally, the desert is far away. Very. In Morocco, to reach the first dunes of the Sahara from Marrakech takes 8 hours drive, some of which are on the slopes. The travel is long from the international aircraft to Morocco, then from Marrakech to the camp. Even if there are some air connections from Casablanca to Zagora, we hesitate to spend ""just"" a weekend in the tent.

In Morocco, to reach the first dunes of the Sahara from Marrakech takes an 8-hour drive.  This is one of the reasons why the Agafay desert has wind in its sails. An hour from Marrakech, this desert of rocks - this reg, more precisely - offers the same type of change of scenery but is more accessible. 

Framed by two large wadis, N'fis and Tensift, this geographical area extends over more than 20 km and benefits from a microclimate where it almost never rains: its climatic conditions are close to those of the Sahara. The more adventurous will be disappointed, but many will be delighted to be able to live this experience and, once convinced, try their luck again in the heart of the dunes of the Sahara... 

by taking more time this time. Another asset: the Agafay desert unfolds splendid landscapes, whose ochreous hills resemble the spectacle of sandy dunes. In the background are the snow-capped peaks of the Atlas Mountains... Grandiose!

In the heart of this desert, Inara Camp offers 10 bivouac tents (including 3 ""Suites"") furnished in a traditional spirit, with local crafts, impeccable comfort, Berber cuisine, and exemplary service. Installed in 2002 in the south of Morocco (especially towards M'hamid el Ghizlane, at the gates of the Sahara), Vincent Jacquet was one of the pioneers of the high-end bivouacs: he has concentrated here more than 15 years of know-how in the field.

  


**2. Under the tent, practical questions**  
Is there electricity? Water? Do I need to bring a flashlight? We imagine the desert, we dream of immensity, then... we have forgotten all the practical details, and it is panic. No need to be alarmed, in fact, everything is planned. Whether this seems inconceivable, reassuring, or disconcerting - at the choice of the people - the camp is totally autonomous energetically. This means that yes, there is electricity in the tents - although one appreciates the candle lighting that illuminates the camp at nightfall. Yes, there is water: a shower itself, a sink, and a real toilet. In fact, everything is brought together as in a classic - and refined - hotel room with a double bed, sofa, desk, etc. - except that the walls are canvases. The only concession to modernity that you will make, is the absence of Wifi ... But it is at least the guarantee of being one-on-one with oneself, one's half, and/or family!. 

Keep in mind, however, that the desert is an extreme environment, especially with regard to temperatures: excessive during the day, they drop drastically at nightfall. Each tent is equipped with a wood stove, which you will be lit every evening... Remember to maintain this fire as much as possible, in order to prolong the hours of heat, without which the mornings can be icy.

  


**3. What about the desert with your family?**

  
Everything that has just been described will be more or less suitable for parents, especially depending on the age of their children. Everyone will deduce or not that the place is suitable for his family. Once again, the desert climate is an extreme environment - even though it has been given all the comfort it wants. For the youngest, do not underestimate the power of the sun's rays during the day, or the cold that can fall at night.

The tents are appropriately spaced from one another on the campsite to protect everyone's privacy, and the reception is completely open to families. All can be furnished with an extra bed and the ""Suites"" can accommodate up to 4 people. Even, for sufficiently ""tall"" children, small tents can be set up next to that of the parents: adventure guaranteed!  


**4. What exactly is the desert experience?**  


  
Since finally this desert is easily accessible and we find almost all the modern comforts ... One might rightly ask: what makes this experience still authentic, still extra-ordinary? Mmmm... Of course. But, imagine, in the middle of the night, the wind comes to caress your frail tent canvas and whispers you out to get some fresh air. There, an absolutely gigantic sky catches your eyes and loses you in the infinity of its glows... In the distance rise the cries of some wild animals. 

No light, no sign of civilization on the horizon, and this immense world of which you suddenly take the measure - and, at the same moment, of yours, of measure, so tiny, almost insignificant. In the darkness, you can see the silhouette of the neighboring tents and the latter, in fact, reassure you a little. At dawn, you contemplate more serene this horizon line... Tonight you had an appointment with the world, you made peace with yourself.

  


**5. The desert is ok, but what do we do there?**

&amp;#x200B;

You can do nothing about it. You have the right to do nothing about it. Perhaps - no doubt - this is the most beautiful experience to do. And far be it from us to explain to you what this can consist of. Because, in the end, it is like when in yoga we seek ""the total relaxation of the body"": it is the exercise that seems the easiest that is actually the most difficult.

On the other hand, do not think that you are forced to do so. Or that we could get bored! Among a range of activities, from morning to night, here is what can await you. A gentle awakening by a yoga class facing the snow-capped Atlas Mountains. A Berber breakfast was served around an elegant table set up under the tent. 

A hike through spectacular landscapes, along rocky trails. A chic picnic in the bed of a wadi, with a table magically set by turbaned men. An excursion on horseback to gallop through the dunes. Discovery of the gullies by quad for thrills. A camel ride to feel the soul of a Bedouin. A massage to help you get rid of the stress leftovers. Since the remodeling is ongoing, even a swim in the pool will be possible soon. And, for those who would not be enough this program, it is also possible to reach, 14 km away, Lake Lalla Takerkoust where you can practice activities ... Nautical! Finally, Marrakech is 30 km away, it is also possible to spend the day there.

At sunset, we sit by a wood fire, to share an aperitif against a background of traditional music. At nightfall, you can also participate in a stargazing session with an astronomer: in the heart of the desert, the sky is of such exceptional purity that you can observe planets, constellations, or nebulae at leisure. 

Served in the tent, dinner will make you discover the flavors of Berber cuisine, simmered over a wood fire for hours (and from products mainly from permaculture).

You thought you would spend a quiet, silent, almost boring evening in the desert? It is a misunderstanding of the hospitality, the joy of living, and the bewitching rhythms of Berber customs! Impossible to resist the rhythms and sounds of the bendir (kind of drum), the Imzad (kind of vielle), the Tamja (flute), or the Azamar (clarinet)... And if by misfortune some Moroccan dancers enter the track, you are lost! Farewell solitude and recollection, you will be forced to participate in the party. And again, stand on your guard, a fire-eater could soon subjugate you with his flames!.",sleeping in the Moroccan desert : all you need to know,,Mortraveling,,2,2022-04-28 18:28:56

Im going to Peru in a little under a month and I was wondering what is the best app for your phone to find places to stay. Ive found that everywhere in the world is different. In SE Asia I found that [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) would generally have the best deals and fairly accurate reviews.  Although in Peru it doesn't seem to be the case as from quickly glancing over its mostly just hotels. So far HostelWorld has been pretty solid.

A friend of mine and myself are planning a 6 months trip to southeast Asia starting in September. We're living in France but are basically looking for the cheapest options to Asia so we'd also be ready to move around if the tickets are cheaper from another country.

Our plan is to spend 1 or 2 months in Nepal and then to travel closer to southeast Asia (Indonesia, Borneo, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), or the other way around.

We searched Skyscanner for flights from Paris/Milan/Lyon/Geneva to Kathmandu and New Delhi, but we did not find too many options, and the few we did were one way tickets for around 300€. Is it possible to find anything cheaper, maybe by getting a two ways tickets straight off ?
We are not opposed to travelling for longer in order to get there, but the fewer the layovers the better.

Do you have any good companies to recommend for this itinerary, good flight connections that would get us there or good hidden gems websites that we could use ?

With my brother, we are planning a trip in South East Asia from mid-september to the end of October, and we are having a hard time to decide which country we want to visit, between Indonesia and Vietnam.

We are not really into partying and seeing cities, but we really want to see beautiful nature, jungles and temples! Also we would love to sleep in nature with hammocks, and some scuba diving.
I have the feeling that Indonesia is a little bit more about sea life and beautiful beaches, and Vietnam would be more diversified and ""adventurous"" maybe? Is it the case or not at all? 

It's really hard to decide as both of the destinations look awesome! We are also open to Toher countries in the same area, but some are closed like Laos. Maybe Thailand would be a good choice? For the moment I have the feeling that it's a bit more touristic.

The tarptent seems to be about a lb lighter than the copper spur and also has a bit more room inside (could fit two extra-wide mattresses). Copper and double rainbow have the same height and both have two doors. 

Only issue with double rainbow is that you have to seal seams yourself (not a huge deal- kinda sounds like a fun project) but I'm worried about the seals durability over time.

I am planning on travelling in Europe starting in September. I've saved up 5000€ by then, and I was wondering how long do you think I can manage?

I leave from Helsinki and fly to Gran Canaria with Ryanair --&gt; Mallorca --&gt; Sardinia --&gt; Malta --&gt; Krete --&gt; Cyprus. I'll use Ryanair to hop between the islands. The prices for each flight seems to be around 10-20€ if I manage to use a personal item rather than carry on.

I would be in hostels and make myself breakfast -and 1 meal and probably eat the other one somewhere. 

I don't do a lot of expensive activities, I mostly enjoy beaches and going around the islands with a bus. I'd probably visit some waterparks and museums.

I have to buy a backpack of around 100€. Insurance and other miscallenous ~ prolly another 100-200€.

backpacking,"I am looking to buy a new pair of backpacking shoes that are lighter weight than my Merrell Moab’s. 

An employee at my local REI strongly recommended the Altra Lone Peak 6, stating that they are the most popular shoe amongst backpackers because of their zero drop technology. The more I look into zero drop, the more I am confused whether it is beneficial or detrimental to your feet. It has been especially difficult to find an applicable answer because I have flat feet and many sources I have read state zero drop will make your foot even flatter and increase your chance of foot disease. The other school of thought seems to be that zero drop shoes help your foot grow stronger and actually decrease flat feet. 

All that to say, Im quite lost on the subject. Are there any flat footers out there that have found a conclusive answer to the problem at foot?",Effects of Zero Drop on Flat Feet,,Maximus_prime2,,14,2022-04-24 21:12:44

backpacking,"I recently got exposed to the topic of PFC in sleeping bags, specifically the water-resistant polymer added to make them water-resistent. It seems like the industry has moved away from C8 (long-chain polymer) to C6 (short-chain polymer) which is a good step but not fully safe. The ideal seems to be Nikwax coated sleeping bags ([https://www.rei.com/search?q=sleeping+bags+with+nikwax&amp;pagesize=90](https://www.rei.com/search?q=sleeping+bags+with+nikwax&amp;pagesize=90)) but those are very few (not ideal for backpacking) and also costly.

I would be very interested in volunteering at schools, animal shelters, nature reserves or wildlife shelters. I'm afraid I won't be able to offer a lot as I don't have experience in any of these fields but there have to be at least a few opportunities for someone like me right?

The Maze is the Western district of Canyonlands, and is by far the most remote backpacking trips I've taken.

The book  'Secrets of the national parts' has the following to say about the district.

""The Maze can make parts of the Needles or Island in the Sky appear as civilized as Central Park. It's virtually trail-less with routes usually marked by cairns - if at all. This is about as remote an area there is in the American West, and any visit should entail a serious amount of planning, gear , and fortitude... Your reward? The same sense of satisfaction in self-reliant exploration shared with the early explorers to this region -- only about 3,000 people a year make the trek.""

backpacking,"Hello, everyone! I've been invited by a good work friend to go on a backpacking and fishing trip next month, in a group of four co-workers. I'm rather excited about this opportunity, which is a first for me, as I've only gone hiking on short trips before. Similarly, I've gone fishing while camping but never did the two simultaneously. This being said, how do you guys recommend prepping for this day-long trip? How do I pack light for both hiking and fishing without sacrificing mobility and comfort?

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, I'm trying to plan on the regular gear I would take on a hiking trip by only taking the most necessary items. Water and snacks, a second set of comfortable clothes, a first aid kit, a portable power bank, a lighter, and some other small items that won't take up much space.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, while I'm less experienced in fishing, I gather I should rent a more portable fishing gear. To this end, and for an overall cozy experience, I'm asking you guys for recommendations on a lightweight fishing reel with included gear, bait, lures, hooks, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note, and try not to judge, but I'm mostly a """"safe"""" and """"cozy"""" type of camper, as most trips I've taken with friends, family, or girlfriends were either in hotels when visiting cities or in tents kept near our cars. I've also enjoyed RV camping, especially when my friends here in Florida took me camping at this spot [https://jasminebreezerv.com/](https://jasminebreezerv.com/). Having all the comfort you would need, including water, electricity, and bathrooms, while still being able to make a fire, catch and cook fish, and go on hikes, was all delightful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I hope I enjoy this trip we're taking next month and try to go out hiking and fishing more!

&amp;#x200B;

* We live in the southwest US, so anywhere in the CONUS would be within range, as well as central America.
* We're both very fit and have no trouble doing 20-30 mile days, maybe more, terrain dependent.  Would rather long days and being goal oriented than shorter days and casual pace.
* Would prefer it be warmer weather.
* I think loops are way more fun than out and backs.

Everytime I mention my views on travelling and how I would not like to backpack etc, people, especially men tell me two things - Well travelled women are so hot!! Or how backpacking is better. This just makes me feel insecure/inferior? Because a) I'm not crazy about traveling, yes it would be nice to visit some places but idk it just feels like it's a mandatory thing to do and many people around me find well travelled people attractive? B) I'm from a third world country, my passport is VERY weak I barely have access to around 30 or less countries although people around me (where I live right now) have stronger passport and can travel freely anywhere they want which also adds to the feeling of unattractiveness. Honestly, the only reason I would like to travel is just to get it off my list and tell people yeah I've been places.

backpacking,"Two night trip to Wallace Lake and Shaw Lake in Wallace Falls State Park. Per the recommendation of the Park Ranger, we went up Greg Ball trail to Wallace Lake the first day. There was no other backpackers at the lake, lucky for us because there was only one campsite with 1 tent platform. The privy was full almost to the brim, but praise B I held onto my hitchhiker. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our destination was Shaw Lake, which the original trail has since been decommissioned for reasons unknown to us. He gave us a crappy map to follow the forest roads, and with a little route finding we finally got to the lake. We needed to cross through some dense forest to regroup with an old logging road. From there (near the unnamed pond which we named James' Pond), the trail was fine all the way to Shaw Lake. The ranger said they make it up there probably twice a year, it was clear they went recently because there was recent cutting along the trail. 

Shaw Lake is beautiful, with 1 campsite with 3 unusable tent platforms. Instead of sand or dirt, they were filled with large gravel, and tent stakes did not work. The fire pit and picnic table are located at the waters edge, down a steep hill from the campsite. No privy, but plenty of soft ground to drop off hitchhikers. 

We did not want to go back the same way, but rather wanted to see if we can get to Jay Lake using my Maps3D app. With some route finding, we made it. There was definitely some 'going back to nature' along the trail and old logging road, probably impassable in the next couple of years. 

Overall a pleasant trip. I would like to hope they have plans of keeping it accessible. What a great getaway.

I’m posting this so you can maybe give me some advice on the trip. I’m not sure how much money I should save to be able to make this trip and go around for 2 months.  
I hope this post finds someone that has already done something similar, and can give me some suggestions on how to make this the best way possible.

Cheers!",Trip in South America,,Ruzz6,,3,2022-04-20 00:10:30

What forums, YouTubers podcasts do you follow if you are like me?  

Most of the time I’m skipping a lot of things because it’s stuff I already know or not for me.

backpacking,"**Hello everyone!**

I was thinking of breaking down my plan for + 1month travelling trip in September and I was hoping to get some ideas from you, and whether you could think of a more optimized way to go about my trip.

So my current idea is to first go to Gran Canaria for 1 or 2 weeks. I've looked at Ryanair flights and they fly from Helsinki to London and then from there to Gran Canaria. My original idea was to spend 1 month in Gran Canaria, because I would hope to have a relaxed time there and enjoy the sun. However, now that I've been thinking about it more, I think I would like to visit multiple places during the trip.

Here's my Idea for now:

**Helsinki (Where I leave) --&gt; Gran Canaria --&gt; Mallorca --&gt; Sardinia --&gt; Crete**

How should I go about breaking down the time for each place? My mind tells me I would like to spend a little bit more time in the first destination, to get a relaxed start. So if I spend lets say 5 weeks for the trip, it could mean that I spend two weeks for the first, and 1 week for each.

I like to go around the island and visit different places, so I would like to have time for that during my stay. Logically thinking, the biggest island should get the most time.

I've read you should book your flights about a month before at least, so I would have to be very sure of how much time I want to spend in each place. This kinda sucks in my opinion because it takes away freedom of choice and freedom from excessive planning. But as I am Island hopping, its harder to get from one island to the next. Would it be a big risk to not book every flight before the trip?

Next up, what about the budget? I will have at least 3000€ saved up by September, and if I live frugally,  make most of my own meals and don't do a lot of expensive activities, will I be able to do this trip with that money?

Flights would be extremely cheap if I didn't have to get priority on Ryanair, but as I will have a 30-35L backpack, it won't fit under the chair. These are some backpacks I've been looking at: Osprey Porter 30 ( **H 50 / W 32 / D 20** ), Daylite 26+6 ( **H 43 / W 33 / D 16** ), farpoint 40 ( **H 54 / W 35 / D 23** ).  RyanAir's personal item dimensions are ( **H 40 / W 25 / D 20** ) and the priority carry on is ( **H 55 / W 40 / D 20** )

Has anyone else here done Island hopping? How has it been? Is there any concerns for the budget or for the flights you could mention? Have you had difficulties finding hostels, and have you reserved them beforehand or on the go?",Island hopping in the Mediterranean + Gran Canaria,,FundinTheThird,,2,2022-04-18 15:34:29

I figured I should make a seperate post and to not post this on the weekly thread cause I have bad experience with those.

Sorry for any spelling errors. My written englisch is a little bit rusty.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my GF (both 20/german) are going to visit the US and Canada in roughtly 1 month. Flight is booked ESTAs are already here. We are going to start in NY, stay there for a few days and than take a bus/train (mby to Rochester) and hike the rest of the way upstate towards Niagara Falls. Entering Canada and exploring it (mby visiting Montreal/Quebeck). After that the next stop is probably Detroit to catch the Amtrack train towards LA or SF (can't remember witch it was). Mby rent a car there to visit Grand Canyon and Death Valley and to drive north allong the west coast towards Seattle.

\+ we have to be back in NY for our flight back.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably my biggest consern is the scale of the US. Its so much larger than what I know from home here i germany, and im honestly kinda scared when I think about beoing lost somewhere with probably no acces to a car or any other means of transportation. Just a backpack, tent and food for mby 2 days. Can we just camp nearby the road when its eavening or is this prohibited? How do ppl react towards two basicly teenagers if you ask them if you can give them a ride or to crash in your barn for one night (rural areas). or is this a thing that is only in my head and I shouldn't even think of doing? How much can you trust those rodeside motels?

We both have savings of round about 5000 USD to a maximum of 8000-9000 USD each (5000 being what we belive we are going to spend and 8000-9000 the upper maximum we have available so we won't be broke when we come back) through work, family and savings.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are the questions I could think of rn from the top of my head. I hope that this is even seen by anyone.

We had no rain and just a couple of cloudy days in 2 weeks, although it did snow on Kala Patthar.  The trails were still relatively empty, although it was starting to get busier as April approached.

backpacking,"Hey r/backpacking ! I have about a month off in the last two weeks of august into the first two weeks of september this year, and plan to head off somewhere by myself with a backpack.

I've (kind of) narrowed down my destinations but I'm struggling to decide. My current top choices are: Malaysia, Peru, Nepal, Philippines, or Cambodia. I'm looking to spend not much more than $2500 after flights.

Malaysia: Tbh I'm completely drawn in by the food but not sure whether a month might be too much. Curious to hear what people have found.

Peru: I've travelled Mexico and hope to brush up on my Spanish, the food and the views are a big draw.

Nepal: Want to do lots of hiking but have also heard mixed things about late Summer weather.

Philippines seems like an all around solid choice, lots of great nature attractions, but I'm also wondering whether things like city life and food might be better in some of my other options.

Cambodia: The history of Cambodia is a big draw for me. I went to Vietnam, and found it really fascinating how every region was very open about how the two wars had shaped their country. Would love to learn more about Cambodia but also wondering if a month is too much!

Curious to hear people's experiences in each countries, bad or good! Any and all recommendations are welcome.

Other potentially relevant info about me: 22 year old male, outgoing, will eat anything and everything, very happy with being uncomfortable. I like to take my time so I'm tentative about doing two countries in a month (also covid-testing twice makes me a little nervous).

backpacking,"I  was beginning to collect some good camping gear a few years ago, but  then my wife got sick and everything got put in the garage. She passed  away just over a year ago and I've been trying to find things to fill  the void. Talked a group of 5 friends with no backpacking experience or  gear into a 3 day/2 night adventure with a 7 mile hike in to a campsite in northern California. I'm 6'5"" and weigh 260lbs so I don't mind a little extra weight. I've done this run once before, but it was  just me and my wife.  Last time I did this, I actually lugged a small  plastic cooler with a couple of steaks and a bag of charcoal the whole  damn way but it was a pain in the ass lol

Also don't mind paying a little extra for quality gear. It will get used, and I like the emergency preparedness aspect as well

1st  off, I'm looking for advice on the best camp stove I can get for the  occasion.  I have a fitness city titanium pot set 1.2L, 800ml, fry pan. I  also have a solo stove and two snow peak titanium bowls and a couple  cups. Right now I'm looking at the jet boils and the MSR windburner, but  I've never used one, and I need to feed 6.

I  plan to make dehydrated meals for everyone, but hamburgers or something  might be cool for the first night. I really have almost no experience  so any tips would be great. What ever I end up doing, I'll do a couple  of practice meals on whatever stove I get so I don't end up looking  incompetent in front of a bunch of hungry people. Coffee is a must as  well

Second is I'm a bit tight on  tent space. I bought a Big Agnes 2020 Copper Spur HV UL3 Tent for the  occasion, and I already owned a good 2 person backpacking tent, but I  didn't expect everyone that I invited to commit, so now I'm short one  person. As I stated before, none of the invited have any experience or  gear, and they all have to buy packs and sleeping bags still.

There's  a waterfall on the beach about a mile from the campsite where I plan to  collect and filter water. I ordered a platypus gravityworks 6L for this  task. Might take a large water container to shuttle more water but  haven't decided. There's running water at the campsite but it tastes  horrible. It's been a few years but I still cringe at the memory of  being dehydrated and trying to drink that water.

Sorry, its probably a bit of a disorganized rant, but any gear suggestions or food ideas would be much appreciated.

EDIT: Dates are early May

I also have a foodsaver and can handle making the dehydrated meals well enough",The blind leading the blind,,TheTinkerChannel,,5,2022-04-16 03:44:20

I know almost all insurance companies are awful when you try to get money out of them so I'm not sure if I can trust the negative online reviews since I'm sure all insurers have these.

Do I just buy the insurance because on paper it seems to cover all grounds needed or how should I go about this.

backpacking,"Hi there, I was wondering what you would consider ""used"" boots and what is still good to buy?

I'm trying to be a thrifty shopper and I came across a pair of Saloman 4D quest shoes for $60 CAD. Outside still looks pretty sturdy, treads look good and they've been worn for \~30 hours over two 10 hours hikes and a couple of smaller ones. They've for sure got a lot of life left in them but I don't know whether I should just spend an extra $40 to get a cheap new pair or if that's a great deal for a gently used high-quality pair.

I know that boots are tricky to buy used since they conform to your feet but a couple of online sources are saying 80-100 hours (usually spread out over 1-4 weeks) are how long it takes to break boots in.

Where would you guys put the cut off for buying a pair of boots? I will try them on and make sure the treads, laces and soles are in good condition as well as testing the support and fit for me. Thanks!

edit: looking to thru-hike a couple of times over the summer in Ontario, my pack weight is currently a little less than 30lbs (edit: NOPE I calculated wrong, it's 44lbs with 15lbs consumables) and i'll post my plan soon as well. I'm just using my alloy toe work boots right now, they work but I want to upgrade to actual hiking boots.

edit: I also found Columbia Newton ridge boots on sale new for $100 CAD which is another option?",How used are you willing to go for boots?,,squideater,,32,2022-04-14 20:25:10

Budget - I have about 15k saved up (idk if that's too much or not enough) 
Backpack - 55L osprey (can't remember the model) 

Questions ,

The best way to travel around through Europe? I've heard it's EURAIL pass but id like to confirm if that's true

Should I book my hostels in advance? Like fully plan out where I am going, where I am staying, for how long? Vs going with thr flow and figuring it out when I get there 

Best way to have money on you/paying for thing? Should I keep my credit card? Take out cash daily? 

For clothes, I don't know what a good amount is. I was thinking of just packing 4 of everything except for long pants. Should I bring 2 pairs of shoes? 

Do I need to change my phone plan? I was planning on keeping it on airplane mode for the most part (I hqve a Samsung but im getting an iPhone for imessage)

\- What are the possible campsitres in 33 Aloha? 

\- Do we have to stay in Aloha for all 3 days of our reservation or can we move around?

backpacking,"
Me and a friend want to visit Eastern Europe in July but aren't sure where to go. We live in Norway and think about being away for 10-12 days. We want to visit a big city or two, but also visit some smaller towns as well. We’d love to experience some nature (mountains, forests, rivers, etc.). We don't plan on spending too much money, so things such as food, BEER (very important) and accommodation should be cheap wherever we're going.

(Visiting more than 1 country shouldn’t be a problem)

backpacking,"Planning a trip with my wife and dogs in the next couple of weeks no Nordhouse Dunes in Michigan.  It's not a long hike but we figure it's a decent place to dip our toes into backpacking, so I packed my bag and weighed it in at a whopping 45 lbs (20.41 kg) without clothes, food, or water.

I weight in at about 175 lbs (79.4 kg), and following the 20% bodyweight rule (I'm not a track star but I'm not the least fit person in the world) I'm aiming for about a 35 lb (~16 kg) pack weight.

Itemized and weighed EVERYTHING.  Went through and prioritized items while removing the stuff that was essentially creature comforts.  I have a problem with trying to pack for glamping while backpacking, but I ended up with about 39 lbs (17.7 kg).  The weight feels fine for our shorter trips.

The heaviest item I know I could reduce weight with new gear is the tent.  I'm hoping to split the tent up and give my wife the stakes and rainfly; however, she has an old knee injury (not super serious) so I'd like to limit her pack weight to even lower than the suggested 20%.

The idea is we'd both carry our own food/cookware, sleeping bags/pillows, and a Sawyer squeeze system for each of us, but we still have dogfood and water to worry about.  Well eventually get the dogs harnesses that allow them to take the burden of some of their necessities but it's not an immediate option unfortunately.

TLDR: Long winded, unnecessary explanations aside, I'll link to my lighterpack list and I really need you guys to tear it apart.  Ridicule me for my item choices.  Recommended me lighter options or gear that can fill multiple roles.  I know even my shaved down list is atrocious, so I'm ready to get roasted.

[https://lighterpack.com/r/00iwec](https://lighterpack.com/r/00iwec)

EDIT:. Just an FYI, I have been removing/updating items on the list from the link above based of your guys' feedback.  For example, the tent I originally packed was a 4P instead of a 3P tent as I had thought (both are still garbage brands) so I went back through and updated weights.  Saved over 5 lb right there.",Looking for Some Gear Feedback,,A1ex4nd3r,,14,2022-04-11 17:00:01

backpacking,"Hi all, I’m looking into purchasing my first “serious” critter/bear proof food storage system, and I’ve landed on Ursack AllMitey. I know that last year they removed the inner Velcro closure from their AllMitey bags without initially telling anyone and people seemed to be unhappy (although removing the Velcro did save weight and add a bit more “usable” space inside the bag, so some people probably liked that). After reading all of the negative reviews about the new version I reached out to Ursack to ask if they planned on bringing back the original design. I was informed that they WILL be bringing back the Velcro version of the AllMitey (in a white bag color) and they will continue to offer the no-Velcro version of the AllMitey (in the current black bag color). The production run for the white Velcro version is supposed to finish up by the end of this month (April 2022) and then be listed on the website sometime shortly after. 

My question is: which one do you prefer, and why? I’m inclined to wait for the Velcro version to come back (13oz), but the reduced weight of the no Velcro version (9oz) is tempting. Also I’m not sure if a white food bag would get dirty too easily?

I'm flying to Bangkok in 3 months and plan to travel throughout Southeast Asia for a year or so. I haven't been abroad in 10+ years so I'm feeling inexperienced when it comes to planning and packing. My budget is £10,000-£12,500.

What do I need to do before I leave? 

I've got vaccinations sorted but visas I'm unsure of. From what I've read I only need a visa for Cambodia and Laos, is that right? I'm British. I'm going to exchange cash, what currency should I get? I plan to visit most countries, so dollars and a small amount of native currencies? I'm going to get travel insurance sorted before I leave. Do I need a local SIM card? I'm going to various countries and I don't think there's a network that covers them all. I've read about an esim that does called airalo, any good?

What should I pack? 

I'm using a 40 litre backpack and the airline I'm using has a maximum weight limit of 8kg (17.5lb). I'm pretty sure my bag is going to weigh more than that, are airlines strict with this kind of thing? Do they weigh carry on luggage? (Sorry if these questions seem stupid or obvious, I'm an absolute novice). Aside from clothes, what do I need to pack? 

I'm going solo but want to meet people. What's the best way of doing this? Hostels and doing things/going to places?

backpacking," 

Hello! me and my friend are travelling to South America for the first time early June! We plan to stay minimum 3 months and have a budget of approximately £4-5K each. The only thing we are planning on booking in advance is Machu Picchu, seeing where the rest of the trip takes us. We have an idea of the places we'd like to visit but are realistic that they aren’t all possible. Looking to see if there’s any other recommendations or places that aren’t worth going too. Will take recommendations for anything such as hostels, workaways, clubs and bars, packing tips (especially going in June), markets, restaurants, activities etc.

**Peru:** Lima (Miraflores, Barranco?), Paracas, Nazca, Huacachina, Arequipa, Ttito, Cusco, Iquitos, Trujillo, Huaraz, Chachapoyas, Choquequirao

Ø Lake Titicaca

Ø Sacred valley

Ø Machu Picchu (considering Inca trail and doing the activity based trek with mountain biking, rafting etc and booking through trip advisor in advance. Aware of Salkantay trek also. Would like to hear other peoples experiences 😊)

Ø Rainbow mountain

Ø Maido restaurant (Miraflores)

Ø Central restaurant (Barranco)

Ø Colca canyon

Ø The floating islands

Ø Pisac market

Ø Nazca lines

**Bolivia:** La Paz, Rurrenabaque

Ø Uyuni salt flat

**Ecuador:** Guyaquil, Banos, Quito

**Columbia:** Medellin, Bogota, Cartegena, Minca

Ø Parque tayrona

Ø Lost city

We land in Lima and want to do some of the above places, however, are still in the process of planning a rough route. We are also wondering whether to go to Cusco early on in the trip, acclimatise, do Machu Picchu and then carry on the with the rest of the places so we aren’t restricted with a booking. Or book it for a month and a half into our trip approximately, see the places in Peru and Bolivia etc and do it on the way back.

We are interested in seeing Iguaza falls too if possible. Does anyone know if we could get a bus from Bolivia as a cheaper alternative to flying?

P.s. any quieter accommodation recommendations for the first couple nights in Lima after the long flight from the UK?

I want to go for two days one night and I saw that there were some hot springs around the area so that peaked my interest but I’m not sure which one may be good for me. I know they were rated as longer/ harder hiked but finishing at a hot spring sounds so satisfying.

Some background: 
My plan is for this to be a solo trip and I’m a pretty fit 23 year old woman. I lift and rock climb multiple times a week (dont ask me about cardio 😬)
I’ve never gone backpacking before, but I’ve done plenty of day hiking along the coast, in Tahoe, Yosemite(I just did the cables on half dome last summer!), and most recently out at Rocky Mountain in Colorado. 
Because of all that I feel like I could easily manage 8-16 miles in a day depending on elevation gain and I could see myself hiking anywhere from 6-10 hours in a day.

I don’t have a good car for car camping and I don’t know what I should do for parking either, I’m assuming it really depends on the trail that I end up choosing..

backpacking,"Has anyone here done/planned any crazy backpacking/kayaking trips? 

I've backpacked only once, but got the idea to do what I think will be a 3 week trip starting at headwaters and ending near home.

My maternal grandparents were the outdoorsy ones, and my aunt and uncle from that side are also the same way. My paternal side is deeply rooted in agriculture, and we were unable to make a lot of the backpacking trips available through my youth due to the work keeping us from recreation. Save for one trip to a set of lakes in the mountains. I've always wanted to embrace more of that life and have gotten into hiking and hunting as much as I can manage.

I think this trip would involve a lot of what ifs and seasonal planning, as well as caches of supplies at major junctions along the route. Preliminary map planning is more or less done (with the understanding that you can only determine so much about the route distance of a river with Google Maps), but the experience isn't completely there. I can find excuses to get away from work at certain times of the year, but training for something like this may take a decade for my wife and I to accomplish.

Overall, this trip would involve, for sure, 2 days of backpacking. Add on however many days of backpacking it would take to get back down to kayak waters (also not including obstructions like downed trees). The majority of the trip would be on the water, with 3 major obstacles (requiring progress to be made on foot at these points). And fairly minor whitewater for at least 1/3 of the journey. Multiple supply caches/dropoffs would be planned ahead of time, in one way or another.

In the end, I'm looking for any guidance that might be out there. I have the very low end of backpacking equipment (freeze dried foods and Jetboil, water filtration, tools, etc.), but I know I'll need more for this kind of trip. There will be multiple opportunities along the way to purchase supplies from small foothill towns if the need arises, but we want to be as self-sufficient as possible.

Are there any experienced outdoor recreation people here to help advise a novice in this venture? Thanks ahead of time.",Backpacking/Kayaking Expeditions,,AugustRain1994,,7,2022-04-09 07:32:55

backpacking,"Hey everyone, I need help choosing my first backpack. I don’t see myself taking more than 1-3 day trips, but having the ability to pack for more days in the future would be kinda nice. I got pretty light base gear for the most part, a Nemo Dagger 2p tent, Tensor sleeping pad, and a down sleeping bag(about 8lbs all together). I’ll also probably be carrying a jet boil, small pan, and a helinox chair. 

I’ve been looking into the Osprey atmos AG 50 or 65, as I have a 35% off coupon for all their products. I’m still on the fence though, as I’ve heard their packs are more suited for super heavy loads and the AG system tends to squeak. There’s no REI near me so I can’t really look at packs in person.

I've been trolling eBay for packs for my 1.5 month hitchhiking trip this July and August that will ideally take me from Georgia to the PNW, camping or squatting every night with some wilderness excursions along the way.

I'll be bringing the clothes I listed in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hitchhiking/comments/tv9whd/clothes_to_bring_hitchhiking/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) plus a jacket, a small tent, sleeping bag, foam sleeping pad, first aid kit, bear spray, phone charger and phone, a couple books and maps, water pouch and water bottle, and of course food supplies (I intend to not carry very much, seeing as I'll be sticking close to civilization), a small pot and camping stove.

I found a great deal on a beautiful 80L Gregory pack, but 80L might be too much. It looks like it can cinch down quite small but I'd still be worried about weight distribution and potential drivers being deterred by the mass of the thing.

Since I am from the United States, I am considering extending my trip and try to experience more of Norway. I want to get a more local feel and to avoid the touristy areas.

I also want to know what are the best spots in terms of other European cities as well. I am considering flying from Staavenger to Copenhagen or taking a flight to spend some time in Helsinki, Riga or Tallinn. I am more interested in Riga as they have the Jewish Museum. Tallinn is also interesting as I feel it is one of those European countries that most people don't visit.

Also, how easy is it to meet up with other Europeans/expats in Europe. I would love to do more hiking trips, but having another person to do it with would be lots of fun! I plan on staying in hostels for the duration of my stay in Europe.

backpacking,"Currently having a bad experience with Osprey Europe. 


TLDR at the bottom.

I wanted to return a bag I bought from them that wasn't suitable for my needs, so I looked up their site to find out what the return process was. You download a form from their site, fill it in and send the package to an address on the form. So I did that, paid for tracking at the post office and waited to hear back.

Two weeks go by hear nothing from them. I see from the tracking that the package was delivered. I email their customer care inquiring what was the hold up.

Long story short, the returns form had the WRONG RETURN ADDRESS. 6 months ago, Osprey changed the warehouse they use for returns but did not change the address on their webpage. And it's their policy that they will not refund my money until they get the returned item physically back to them. (They acknowledged that I shouldn't have been able to access that old form with the incorrect information, and their tech team is going to fix it. Although as of now, the incorrect information is still available on their site.)

They did reach out to the old warehouse, but they have no record of my return being delivered there. I was informed that it could still possibly show up, but that could take ""some time"" and there is nothing I can do right now except wait.

Now if I personally had messed up the returns, then I understand I shouldn't get a refund

But I followed their own websites instructions exactly, yet I am the one being punished and I'll quite possibly be out of pocket due to their mistake.

Sorry if this is a little long. I probably just needed to vent. I'm quite annoyed about the whole thing.

TLDR: Sent return to address from Ospreys website. Turns out it's the wrong address and they won't refund me until they get my returned item which may be lost through no fault of my own.",Bad customer care experience with Osprey,,bobbyhill018,,6,2022-04-06 23:45:13

Obviously unsustainable over multi day trips, but I still want to record GPS. How do I extend this? 

I know plane mode helps a little. 20k mAh powerbank might get me a week of that IF i don't check map, internet, or take photos (which I still want to anyway).

Are smart watches the way to go? Optimized phone with a simpler GPS tracker that I then export to strava once I get home? 

Probably don't want to blow 800 on a Fenix 7 although I know the battery is incredible.

Powerbank plus GPS watch? (amazfit stratos 3?) Can I expect up to a month with a watch and 15000 mAh powerbank?

I will be going to Mexico for 14 days from the 7th of April 2022. My mobile carrier in the UK wants to charge a fortune for roaming, so that's not an option. I was thinking about buying one of those 4G hotspots and sticking a local sim card in it.

backpacking,"Hello everyone!

I'll be backpacking around Europe for 70 days and I've yet to decide on the type of bag or bags that I should be carrying. 

My itinerary is somewhat of a good mix of cities, hiking, and small towns. Doing the typical Munich -&gt; Salzburg -&gt; Vienna -&gt; Budapest... but mainly, will be travelling across Italy starting from Ancona (ferry from Croatia), down all the way to Naples and then up all the way to the Dolomites. I'm welcome for any critiques for this part too. 

My current plan is to use my 20L Peak Design Everyday backpack as a daypack and buy an Osprey Atmos 50AG. I know I would look extremely silly and be in extreme discomfort but I cannot think of an alternative. I'm an amateur photographer, that is why I need a 20L daypack to store my camera and 2 lenses. Also, carrying the camera on my neck is an option however I'd like to keep it in my bag in shady places. I believe a young Chinese in a small Italian town is hell of a juicy target. 

Would appreciate if you could give me some options and advice. Thank you!!!",Bag or Bags?,,gunslayerjj,,7,2022-04-04 02:50:05

backpacking,"**A bit of background:**

I am 24 years old and I just recently went through a breakup of 4.5 years last month and I am struggling to find purpose in my life. I work at an office job that doesn't pay well and is not fulfilling. Ever since I studied abroad in Italy for a month in 2019, I have loved the idea of traveling. In the summer of 2020, I planned to backpack through Europe during the Euros with my then SO, which obviously fell through because of Covid.

Once my lease ends in July, I am wanting to quit my job and book a flight to Europe by myself while meeting people of all different cultures and discovering my sense of purpose. I don't want to do touristy attractions or cities as I want to visit villages and stay at family-owned hostels that are more authentic. I am American.

**My questions:**

What countries would you recommend to go to within Europe that are affordable? I don't have a ton of money but am willing to travel as cheaply as possible.

Will I be screwed in the job market when I come back?

How realistic is this to go by myself and be able to meet people and share experiences?

How long should I plan on going?

backpacking,"Is it possible to jerry rig a 55 **°** F(13 **°** C) (comfort level) Sleeping Bag + an R1.4 sleeping pad in possible  32 **°** F(0 **°** C) - 20 **°** F(-6 **°** C) weather?

Some ideas I have so far are:

1. Bringing a rubber hot water bottle that I can stuff in my sleep bag to add heat all night.
2. Using an intense sleeping bag liner / jungle blanket. (any recommendations on one would be amazing).
3. Stuffing hot rocks near/under the tent.

I have a 3 day backpacking trip planned for the Catskill Mountains of New York next weekend. The weather report at ground level says it will be within the range of my sleep system. However the hike will take us along an exposed ridgeline for \~20 miles/32km  where we will be at elevations of 4000ft/1220m  above sealevel.... and because it's early Spring there is a slight chance the weather may drop to 20 **°** F/-6 **°** c.

We are trying for ultralight and I will be using either a REI FLashAir2 tent or my bug out bivy.

Short of buying a new 3 season bag and an r4 sleeping pad---budget is tight---does anyone have any ideas? Is my plan malarkey?  Has anyone pulled this off without terrible suffering?

backpacking,"I was looking at buying a compressible pillow because those inflatable ones are awful. If you add too much air  it is too hard; add too little and your face is enveloped and you can't breathe. Plus, the noise every time you turn!   


So after many reviews, I realized that I needed to by a compressible pillow. There may be other brands, but if there are I haven't seen any. First, if you decide to buy one, they have them on sale through a couple websites as low as $20 for a medium. Amazon is $52, so stay away from them on this one.  


But for my normal house pillows I bought ones where it came with extra fluff (DreamyBlue is the brand I purchased for about $60). The fluff already included was too much, so I pulled some out. I now have enough for my pillow at night as well as I have enough extra to make my own camping pillow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got two throw pillow covers (just basic blue) for $5 and used my extra fill to create my own camping pillow. Weighs about 350g, but could cut more weight if I used a thinner pillow case. I compresses down to the size of about a large Nalgene (or two coffee cups stacked on top of each other).  


So it may not be economical to go buy a $60 pillow to save $20 on a camping pillow, but if you're looking for a new pillow anyways, or have some extra fluff lying, something to think about. Alternatively, you can buy 5lbs of shredded memory foam for about $30, which would be enough to make two if not three pillows.",Poor Man's Thermarest Compressible Pillow,,rawr_gunter,,4,2022-03-31 19:05:52

backpacking,"I love to solo hike, primarily in the Sierra Nevada region. I'm looking for an ultralight tent that is free-standing. I'm very short, so space is not an issue, even if it's cramped for other people, and I do 3-season hiking, so no snow requirements. Since I backpack a lot in very rocky places, and I am also impatient, I'm looking for a lightweight, quality tent (ideally 1P) that is free-standing.

I have been wild camping a while but this was my first camp with Kono, wasn't sure how she would get on through the night so I ended up sleeping with the inner door open all night so that she could still see me and I could keep an eye on her. She did amazing though and was rather chilled about everything, even with the wind flapping the tent around in the early hours of the morning.

backpacking,"Hi all,

I bought a used early-90s Gregory 80L pack recently. The frame is size L and I have a short torso so the shoulder straps are a little high for me. At the shortest adjustment, the internal metal frame is so high that it pokes at my head and precludes any kind of headgear. Would it be possible/advisable to bend or cut the frame so that I can have shoulder support and headroom? It's a really great old pack so I don't want to ruin it unnecessarily, if it won't work out I'd rather just resell it.

backpacking,"My boyfriend and I have historically worn Salomon trail runners (Sense Ride 3 currently) for our day hikes (up to 20 miles), and they've been great. However, we've started backpacking recently, and he always develops foot pain sometime on day 2 or 3 of our hike. We suspect it must have something to do with the extra weight he's carrying (between 20-30 lbs), and as such, we're thinking about replacing his trail runners with some hiking shoes/boots that can help him carry that weight more easily.

Any recommendations? The pain seems to be dispersed generally throughout his feet, but his arches seem to hurt the most. He already uses the Superfeet green insoles; he tried the ones specifically for hiking and liked the regular green ones better. Should he go for more cushioning (e.g. Hokas)? Or should he go for a stiffer sole? Anything else we should consider? Thanks!",Hiking Shoe recommendations for foot pain?,,sk3141,,8,2022-03-29 00:06:09

soon I'm setting off for a 10 months trip from Europe to India and I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle my money during this long trip. Obviously I will have my credit card with most of my money on it, but in some countries  - starting from like Georgia/Iran onwards - my bank does not work. I guess there are some banks which function globally and perhaps have some benefits on withdrawal prices, so my first question is whether you can recommend me some? 

Second question is about how much cash should I keep on myself. I thought of getting perhaps 1500€ in notes, since it can get me better exchange rate for local money and I won't need to spend for often pricy withdrawals. At the same time, I'm also scared of keeping that much on me. What would me the smart way to do this?

Lately i’ve been planning my first solo-backpacking trip theough Europe for one month via interrail or eurail ( mid-april to mid may)

Considering travelling solo for one month, i am concerned about feeling alone on this trip. I am looking after meeting new people, both tourists and locals. I prefer to meet other backpackers who i can travel along with.
Do you guys have any tips to where and how to meet new people?

As i mentioned, the trip will potentially last from mid april to mid-may. Unfortunately I won’t be able to make my trip in the summer. What bothers me, is that april/may is not the peak-season for backpacking og travelling, and i’m afraid to find it hard to meet other backpackers or tourists. Does some of you have experience of backpacking this season of the year?

Finally. I want to have a mixed trip of different experiences in terms of nature, nightlife and european history. I’ve picked some destinations such as Amsterdam, Interlaken and Italy.

backpacking,"Hello all,

I have backpacked a few times and we cheaped out on a few pack items the first go-round just to see if we enjoyed the experience. Looking to upgrade because I had a hell of a time with my first sleeping pad.

I woke up every morning after about 6 hours with awful back pain (I have previously suffered from this so I'm a bit sensitive).

Existing Pad: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FP4Z3RZ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FP4Z3RZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

Some details and questions:

1. My sleeping bag is the Nemo Forte 35. Is a mummy shaped pad suitable or do I need something more rectangular?
2. I'm 6'3"" but very skinny. My tent can accommodate long pads so no issue there.
3. I'm also looking for something that can reasonably be used for three seasons. I don't foresee myself having a lighter pad that is only for warm weather use to shave off a few ounces. So, R Value of 3 is where I'm thinking I'd land.
4. I am open to inflatable or not, but I think that inflatable is the way I'd tend to go.
5. Weight and packability to me is important, so would probably prefer &lt; 2 lbs if possible.

A few options I'm seeing that seem pretty quality (**can anyone confirm if there's any difference between these two Nemo pads (one is $32 cheaper)?**

1. From REI ($160 after coupon) [https://www.rei.com/product/186713/nemo-quasar-3d-insulated-air-sleeping-pad](https://www.rei.com/product/186713/nemo-quasar-3d-insulated-air-sleeping-pad) (seems a bit on the heavier side?) Alternatives?

I am right now beginning the very start of my plans for a 6 month (slow travel so wouldn’t care if it ended up being 9+) backpacking trip in South America. If I did Southeast Asia, I imagine it would be shorter. I like to do things a little differently. While my friends studied abroad in Paris and Barcelona, I looked for programs in Asia and SA. However, this just never came to be with my credits and money. I was recently introduced to backpacking. I had always known what it was but had never really given it any thought. But, I’ve been watching so many videos, reading so many blogs, and I’m hooked. With that being said, if any of you could answer these questions and give me some advice I’d appreciate it so much. I tried to do alot of research before posting because I’m sure the same questions get repeated on this sub.

1. Which is better for a first timer? I’ve heard Southeast Asia has a younger backpacking crowd which may be better for me but really I’d prefer South America. Also, is part of the reason Southeast Asia is better because it’s smaller (comparatively) to an entire continent like South America?

2. Groups. I want an authentic backpacking experience. I do. But I’d really love to find some people to enjoy it with. I know when you go solo you meet people at the hostels and you hang out with them and everything which I am totally not opposed to but I would really really like to go with people. Is there anyone that knows of any kind of group to find this?

3. How much time in preparation for everything (finding people, visas, passports, etc) do you think I need? Also, how much would you say you spent on prep as I can’t find that anywhere.

4. I’ve read 1,000 budgets and I’m thinking to be safe I want about $1500 USD for every month and try to stay way under that. Does that sound good?",South America and Southeast Asia Questions… Advice Needed!,,annaopolis,,2,2022-03-25 15:21:19
backpacking,"# Mumbai Is the Maximum City

It is called maximum simply because everything happens to the maximum here— maximum fame, maximum money, maximum failure, and even maximum disappointment. The city is amiable because behind the cold, materialistic exterior lies resilient people, supporting, helping, and motivating each other in times of distress and whenever the city is under siege by anti-social elements.

And of course, one needs to be daring here to survive the maddening crowds, the rush-hour trains, and strenuous struggles every day to eke out a living and come out winning against all odds. The maximum city is just not everybody’s cup of tea.

# The Soul of Mumbai Isn't Found in Its Iconic Landmarks

That said, enough has been said and written about the iconic landmarks of the city like Marine Drive, the Gateway of India, or even Juhu beach. They are breath-taking and fantabulous, no doubt about it.

But if you happen to be one of those travelers who want to decipher the hidden soul of any city, you need to visit the unexplored, offbeat places where the city shows its true colors and vibrancy.

And here are five of the top offbeat places to visit in order to bring you closer to the soul of Mumbai.

So come August I’m planning on quitting my job that I’ve had for a year since graduating college and traveling for 3 months. Honestly, the travel part isn’t what’s worrying me, but the return.

Is it worth quitting a job to travel for just 3 months and then most likely been unemployed for another 3 months once returning? I’ve never had a restaurant/ temporary work job, would it be difficult to find (I live in a major US city)? I’d also have to live with random people/ my parents. 

I’ve also considered extending my travels and ski bumming once I return, but again, I’m worried I won’t be able to figure this out in time because I’ll be traveling in the fall.

I know it’s between seasons so trails could be quite muddy and rainy or even closed according to some websites.

backpacking,"Was planning on hiking Bright Angel Trail (in Grand Canyon) from rim to Indian Garden this Monday for 2 nights. 2 kids in tow (ages 11 and 13).

Weather.gov gives this forecast for the village at the rim: ""A 40 percent chance of showers after 11am. Partly sunny, with a high near 58. Breezy, with a southwest wind 16 to 22 mph, with gusts as high as 34 mph.""   I believe winds down in the canyon are a bit less.

Anyone have experience or thoughts on this?  Am I looking at cancelling?  Or we could go Tuesday instead and turn our 2-night stay into 1-night. Wind gusts reduce to 22mph on Tuesday (but higher chance of rain).

We have plane tickets and everything booked, and I've spent the last 3-4 months outfitting the family.  We've all car-camped in heavy rain before.  They've never backpacked.  I have no experience being out in the elements in heavy wind.  Bright Angel trail is supposed to be safe, but that's obviously a concern too.

Myself and a friend are taking a 9 day wilderness medicine class in the backcountry of Wyoming at the end of the summer. This will be our first big hike.

Pros/cons, or can recommend other options? I can provide a packing list if that helps at all.

I’ve been to Western Europe outside of Portugal/Spain, so I am interested in those countries. However, as an avid camper/hiker I am keen on visiting Machu Pichu, Patagonia, and other regions in the Andes Mountains too. Algeria/Morocco looks gorgeous so I have my eye on there too. 

I have half a year off to travel next year, so I am mostly looking to go somewhere that may be out of my way on my world tour then. 

I prefer natural beauty/landscapes rather than cities but love to meet new people and learn about different cultures. 

I’m mostly undecided on where to go. I dont care if im spending half the trip in a hostel or a city but I need to get at least 2 days of good hiking. I’m probably equally pleased to spend 5 nights in my tent too.

backpacking," Hello! I am new to posting on this subreddit, but I am a long-time lurker. My friend and I saved money from last December until now for planning a trip to Argentina. We researched different places to visit and still have not made up our minds on where to stay when we go there. While we have saved up enough money to have an enjoyable trip, our issue is that I love the city, yet he loves the outdoors.

I want to be able to do as much as possible on this trip and use it as an exciting bonding experience for both of us. I am a little worried about how we will get around if we choose Patagonia, although I'm assuming we'll rent a car.

Our overall goal is to see sights, meet spectacular people, and have an unforgettable experience that lasts a lifetime.

I also remember a documentary about a small community of tiny housed ""hippies"" living somewhere in Argentina. After searching, it seems as though I cannot find the source to identify which city the village is in. (If someone knows what I'm talking about, please let me know where it is!)

backpacking,"So, I like being prepared. Adaptable. Multi-functional. Most of all, educated.  
I'd like to know more about the stove fuel adapter game.

I hypothesize that I can simply attach the correct adapter for one type of fuel to the fuel canister, and it will thread to the backpacking stove. Thus, producing a ""multi-fuel"" stove.

The stove doesn't stop working like a stove because it was fueled by a different fuel. Fuel is fuel.

So, My question is how many fuels can be used with how many adapters? Is there ONE adapter that fits all fuel canisters to the same stove fuel port?

Or, perhaps, an adapter linked/threaded/connected to another adapter to seat properly to the fuel port on a stove.  
The stove in question is the SOTO Windmaster.  
It, in its stock configuration accepts only Iso-Pro, Iso-Butane.  
I figure that there's got to be an accepted, functional propane adapter to fit the stove fuel port - and now I've expanded the potential number of fuel sources for my stove, if/when it comes time to refuel.

I sleep exclusively on my side and often roll from one side to the other getting to sleep and during sleep. I am afraid the noise will keep me up. Sleep while backpacking is already an issue for me. 

I am in New Mexico and I backpack here, Colorado and sometimes other Western States if that helps with a recommendation. 

I learned about the Nemo Tensor and it seems like a great alternative. About the same weight as the XLite, insulation is suspended so it doesn’t sound like I am sleeping on a giant Sun Chips bag, and the new model has the same r value as the XLite (4.2). 

I want to end up with a pad that will last me a long time and be very comfortable while being relatively lightweight. 

Does anyone here have experience with both pads? Is one better than the other for a side sleeper? Thanks in advance!",Talk Me Out of the Nemo Tensor,,youtakethestallion,,28,2022-03-21 18:04:21
backpacking,"I'll be in Iceland for a bit this Summer and plan to do a 4-5 day hike with a couple friends on the Laugavegur trail. My entire backpacking experience lies in the PNW so Imagine it'll be quite a different experience in Iceland. I was hoping people here who have done something similar might be able to offer some suggestions/tips for the trip.

Was there different gear you wish you had? Anything that was especially useful to bring? Did it get colder than you anticipated? These are just some of the things that pop into my mind but I imagine if you've done your own trip out there you might have some ideas I'm not even considering so I'm open to whatever advice you might have.

backpacking,"Hi everybody,

A Czech traveller/nature lover/hiking enthusiast here planning on going on a two months travel this summer. Possible destinations are France, Italy, Balkans... I want to do it as budget as it can get, so I'd love to try some hitchiking, walking, combined with some wild camping. I also have some volunteering with acommodation planned, so the wild camping will mostly be a filler (always for a few days/a week between locations).

I am looking for something pretty light, versatile, but fairly comfortable and cheap (probably too much to ask, but bare with me please, I am a poor student :)...). Hammock could be probably pretty great, but I don't think there are trees in some of the areas I want to visit, so I was thinking about tarp + bivvy combo, but I don't know if it is any good. Seems that a half of people can swear by it, but the other one says how uncomfortable it is. Do you have any advice for me? 

As I said, I need it to withstand a storm, but also to not be eaten by mosquitoes, nor break my back or bank carrying it.

Thanks for advice! :)

Ah, yes... Also, I'd be great if it'd fit 2 people under the tarp/tent.",Versatile sleep setup recommendation. Tarp+bivvy vs tent vs hammock?,,Vodecko,,12,2022-03-19 00:03:44

Photography consists of a tripod, and a 6ish liter camera bag. Alternatively I'd have a whole 30l camera bag inside my main pack but that seems impractical.

backpacking,"At the end of 2021 a friend reached out to set up a backpacking trip for the end of August. There would be 5 of us total.
I have been hiking 2-4 times a month (minimum) for the past 7 years. However I have never gone backpacking. My friend and 2 others in the group have been on multiple 4+ day trips.

I took the time to map out five different 3-4 day trips all around 28 miles (Olympic, Grand Tetons, Rockies, and Glacier). Because no one else seemed too keen on doing it. We ended up deciding on Fern Lake to Flat Top Mt in Colorado. 
The friend who had reached out originally to set this all up indicated that he would take care of getting permits since they were familiar with the process.
That didn't happen.
All 5 of the trips, which were all in National Parks, are now unavailable due to permits being all bought up for the period we had planned on and several weeks out on either end of it.

I had planned to do several 1-2 night trips on my own prior to the big trip (I live very close to the AT in NY). And I would still like to plan for a larger trip this August but doubt I'm going to find anything available in a Park and be able to get a permit since it's rather late.

backpacking,"I absolutely love nature and hiking. I have spent my entire life hiking alone or with family. I have started getting heavily interested in backpacking and am currently piecing together all my gear. The biggest hang up for me is sleeping at night in the outdoors. I have camped before and have always had a hard time relaxing in my tent at night and sleeping in complete silence. I sleep with a fan by my bed side which drowns a lot of the white noise out.

I have camped near running rivers/creeks in the past which helped tremendously with the psychological side of sleeping in dead silence.

My question is aside from exposure therapy, does anyone have any tips or tricks getting used to it? I plan to buy bear mace, I take melatonin to help sleep, storing food properly, and plan to be doing all of my backpacking with another person.

We are planning to travel from the 26th of June to the 22nd of July and the following cities that we have chosen are based on common interest as well as the EU Rail map as that is how we plan to get around for the entirety of the trip:

* **Rome** 
   * 26th - 30th
* **Florence**
   * 30th - 2nd
* **Bologna**

* **Milan**

* **Paris**
   * 12th - 16th
* **Bordeaux**
   * 16th - 18th
* **Madrid**
   * 18th - 22nd

The dates are how long I have allocated for each city and we will be flying into Rome and then flying out of Madrid. I have a lot of questions that maybe y'all could help me out with if you are able. The budget (not including the flights to and from the U.S.) is sitting at $3,000 USD which allocates a little over $110 USD a day. I was wondering if this budget was feasible? We are planning on staying in hostels as much as we can and I have a buddy who lives in Paris and is willing to let us stay with him for the majority of our time in that city. Also, I planned this trip around the EU Rail system and was planning on getting a rail pass, is this the most effective way to travel or should I look into something like a rental car instead? Also, have I allocated enough time for each city? I was told to give 4 days to the large cities as well as 2 or 3 to the smaller cities. These are just some of my questions at the moment and any other advice would be much appreciated as well. The trip is still far out so the exact details of what we will do in each city are undecided, I just wanted to build a rough outline for now.",One Month Trip to Europe,,WarrenTheMemeLord,,8,2022-03-16 02:46:53

backpacking,"Did a weekend trip to Vega, Norway. It is a popular island to visit in summer for tourists, but in March there are none. To get there you take a ferry in beautiful scenery, surrounded by high mountains and peaks. It is nice and warm during the day, but gets cold quickly at night, but that is a easy price to pay for the breathtaking northern lights. The island itself offers variable nature: forests, tall mountains, bare tundras, incredible coastlines and beautiful lakes. In a 4 hour hike we were able to see all the different types of nature and it was truly amazing.

I could not recommend it enough. And it really is worth taking a trip outside of the tourist season so you can have the island all by yourself.

I am looking for a good long hauling backpack, with a good carrying system. Every year I go on a 10-14 day fishing trip in the wilderness without refill of food, therefore I need a backpack that can carry 35+ kg comfortably (or as comfortably it gets). I pack only the necessary items for the trip, but fishing equipment and camera equipment weigh a lot, as well as food and the other necessities.   


Currently I am using an exped expedition 100L. ([https://www.exped.com/usa/en/product-category/backpacks/expedition-100-olive-grey](https://www.exped.com/usa/en/product-category/backpacks/expedition-100-olive-grey)) but the carrying system is not optimal. Can anyone recommend a long hauling monster backpack that can carry heavy loads and stay comfortable on the hip? I also have a 62 liter arcteryx Bora which has an excellent carrying system and is super comfortable, but sadly not big enough for my needs. If I could combine those two I would be a very happy man.

Wife and I have to be in Budapest this summer for a wedding of a friend, the bride is Hungarian.

I can stay up to 10 days longer, so a distance of 100-150km would definitely be possible (playing it on the safe side). I've been doing multi day backpacking trips for almost 2 decades now, so my fitness level is definitely up to it.

I haven't researched a lot about the trail yet, but from the things that I have read I already know it's going to be very hard to decide on one specific part. I love culture, castles, mountains, lakes, rivers, volcanoes...

I also would like to start collecting the stamps, if that is at least possible if you start at a random spot on the trail.

Our group of 3 guys (early 20s, just graduating Uni from Canada) are planning to backpack Europe between mid-April to early June. Our budget is around ~4k CAD each but we are quite flexible and can increase our spend if need be. Each of us will likely carry a bag that is around 40L, so we can bring it as a carry on to discount airlines such as Ryan Air. As well, we are likely going to stay at hostels and potentially AirBNB for some parts such as Spain. 

Our goal for this trip is to experience the culture, sight-see, visit historical landmarks, and potentially party once in awhile.

backpacking," Greetings!

There is one thing I love : drinking a warm full cup of coffee. And one thing I hate : instant coffee.

So in my previous thru-hikes I used a little method to brew actual coffee while traveling only with the 167g of the Aeropress Go : the one-cup method.

Sure, Aeropress is a luxury item but I'm using it every day and it makes a huge difference. The good thing is that this method allows you to boil/brew/drink in just one titanium cup that is already part of the popotte.

Basically, you boil a full cup of water,

pour some of that warm water into the inverted Aeropress to brew inside the desired amount (150ml water and 11g coffee for me),

wait 2 min,

swirl,

and press the coffee into the cup that still contains warm water, making a full cup with just.... one cup. Sorry for the redundancy.

Anyway I made a little video showing you the process there, and the visual clues to measure all of that without a scale [https://youtu.be/dJsiWP9F\_gA](https://youtu.be/dJsiWP9F_gA)

Hope this improves your coffee game in the wild if it matters to you too! Obviously, quantities of coffee/water can be adjusted to the taste

backpacking,"Planning on a 5/6 week backpacking trip soon. This is my first time so i’m super excited, and trying to figure out ins and outs.

Money
So I’ve done a lot of reddit searching and seems like I should get a charles Schwab debit card and a credit card (could use recomm on what, this would be the first CC so needs to be easily approved). I have a debit card already but it has 3% transaction fees on all international transactions. 

Phone plan
Crazy expensive with international phone plans. 10 bucks a day for my normal plan or 100 a month for limited gb. A sim card seems like the better way to go, and I see a lot of people use an old phone to put the sim card in and then only using their US phone on wifi or for pics.

I was thinking of going on a gap year next year and travelling to Southeast asia. Ideally, I want to work for the first half of the year and then travel for 3 months and if I have money I'm really interested in east asia as well (Taiwan, China, Korea, Japan) though I understand those places are a bit more expensive. Roughly my iternary will look like [this:](https://i.imgur.com/0W44wmz.png)
Basically two weeks in signapore and Malaysia, two weeks in Thailand, two weeks in Laos, two weeks in cambodia and then a month in Vietnam (my homeland). My budget for this is about 15000 aud which I can make while I work. If I had enough money left over I'd go two weeks in Taiwan, 3 weeks in china, a week in Korea and 2-3 weeks in Japan. But as I was planning this I realised that I also have to think about the time of year as well. I am Australian so I am fine with heat, but does anyone with experience know roughly what a good time to visit southeast asia would be? I'd be working for like 6 months and then travel in June, but I don't know if it would be the best for visiting. I'm fine with heat, but would really rather not that much rain.

My question is this, can you sleep two people in a double hammock with any success?

Should I instead save more and get a 3 person tent? It seems hard to find one lightweight and inexpensive enough that has even most of the benefits of that 12' tarp setup. MSR seems to have good ones, but idk.

backpacking,"I recently bought a Klymit Static V. I thought I was getting a warm pad at a great price, but after looking again I’m not so sure that’s the case. When I bought it, it was advertised as having an r-value of 4.4, which would be great for 3 seasons, possibly even 4. 

However, I looked on their website again and it says that it “has a historical r-value of 4.4 and and ASTM r-value of 1.9.”

backpacking,"Hello,

I just bought a new Hilleberg Jannu and noticed that the guylines are thicker than the old models. New models include 3mm guylines instead of 2mm older guylines and they end up with more weight(mostly 3x weight compared to 2mm).

Could you give me some advice if i change them with 2mm will it effect the strength of 3mm guylines?

And also is there any setup that i can seperate the guylines easily from tent and put them on only when needed?

I thought of a setup like that but i don't know if a small carabiner like nite-ize S-biners will sacrifice the strength or the carabiner will damage the tent somehow?

Or any other advice instead of carabiners to put the guylines on and off to the guyout points easily when needed?

backpacking," I've been using the Mountain House and related brands for years, but they are pricey. I do love their convenience (especially the minimal cleanup). But it's time to cut costs and get experimental this year.

I have my own dehydrator which I mainly use for fruits and veggies, occasionally make my own jerky. But I want to save some trip costs (now that gas prices are going to be a huge impact on my backpacking season this year) and was thinking about resorting back to the good ol' Ramen. I could add some dehydrated veggies to Ramen (or instant potatoes), but I'd like to add a source of **protein** as well. What are some hacks you use to ""beef up"" your Ramen. I've found that dehydrating my own jerky to add to it is basically the same cost as those REI dehydrated dinners. Bacon bits? Beans? Any insight is greatly appreciated. Happy trails!

backpacking,"Hocking Hills is a great area in South Eastern Ohio to hike or camp. Many of the state forests in the region (Tar Hollow and Zaleski are the first to come to mind) offer miles of trails, nice camping sites and year round access. The pictures in the post are from Conkles Hollow. Its a small nature preserve with about 5 miles of trail. The rim trail is 3 miles - while very beautiful and scenic can be hazardous in the winter, due to ice on the trail. The gorge trail (where the pictures were taken) is a spur, that is 1 mile in and out. While Conkles Hollow itself doesn't offer any camping, its very close in proximity to the previously mentioned state parks that do, as well as several other areas of interest that offer nice hiking. A personal favorite is the Old Mans Cave -&gt; Ash Cave trail that ends up being about 13 miles, with a stop at Cedar Falls and an optional stop at Whispering Cave.

backpacking,"Title says it. I find there seems to be a dichotomy both in gear itself and in what people choose. Gear seems to be either more subdued earth tones (browns, forest green, grey, etc.) or punchy bright colors (orange, yellow, cobalt blue, red, etc.)

It’s not entirely by brand, for example Patagonia seems to have the entire spectrum, with the mainly bright colors of nano puffs and more, while also have many khaki, brown, and grey fleeces and more. Where as the hammock brand Warbonnent definitely seems to lean towards the camouflage aesthetic (although they now offer many bright colors for quilts).

I’ve noticed amongst my outdoorsy friends, many lean one way or another. Those really into climbing, snow sports, adventure sports seem to like bright colored stuff, maybe it’s a bit of showing off they like REI and the brands and stuff they’ve accumulated, which fair enough we all like gear. Bushcraft guys probably like the more earth tone aesthetic. I tend to lean towards the more subdued, I find it blends more into the environment, like a grey tent looking like one of many rocks, or an olive hammock blending amongst the forest. But I’ve got some bright let colored jackets and such too.

What do you guys think? What have you observed along these lines and what do you prefer? Let’s all keep getting out there.

**Are we in over our heads?** 

We will both be 20 come September and plan on backpacking around Europe, starting in Amsterdam with a budget of around $6000USD. From your experience is $6000 a fair budget, for staying in hostels and using trains/mopeds for transport?

First things first, do you guys think 20 is a bit young to be backpacking? I like to think we are both fairly mature guys for our age, and from the research I've done with common sense backpacking Europe seems reasonably safe. Is this accurate? Any places we should avoid? 

How will we be treated as two young guys in Europe? 

**Your Advice?** 

If you were setting off to backpack for your first time what would you want to know? Any must do's or definitely don'ts? 

Lastly what age range can we expect to run into in hostels, I assume the crowd would mainly be 20's to 30's but not really sure?

backpacking,"For context, I'm 23 and I've been with my girlfriend for 4 months but it'll be 6 months when I go.

I really want it to work but I also want to be able to enjoy travelling. I know it will be incredibly hard for both of us and not sure if it will create a strain between us due to the time.

Part of me thinks end it now, travel and if we both want to, start it back up when I get back. I'm not sure how this would realistically work, things may change for either one of us. 

I don't feel it would be fair for me to say that we should stay together if things don't work out after a couple of months and I've basically waisted extra months of her life waiting.

We both really care about each other, but it's still a new relationship and the fact that we would spend as much time apart as we had been together is a concern.

Have you had a similar situation? How do I go about setting ground rules?

I'm quite sure that I won't be able to contact her often, maybe twice a week.

I'm just looking for any advice or stories of similar situations.

backpacking,"Hi! This summer (july 18-august 13±) I'm doing my first solo backpacking trip outside Europe and I'm going to India. I'm a 21-year old man and I have plenty of prior (family) travel experience in Asia and Africa, so I'm familiar with the country and my common sense is more or less travel-adjusted (I think). 

My rough itinerary is:
-arrival in New Delhi
-travel down towards Rajasthan desert for camels and sand
-travel east through the tiger-inhabited nature reserves.
-back to new delhi

Any cities that you would highly recommend to add to the itinerary? 
Is this itinerary long enough to fill my time there?
How do i get in touch with other backpackers prior to my arrival there?

TL;DR: Im going to India and I could use any and all smart solo travel tips and tricks for there. Including how to safely meet other people or get in touch with other travelers before leaving the Netherlands (my home).

I also have relatively wide hips which measure 40 inches at the widest point, and the spot where my hip belt usually sits I am 36 inches around. Does anyone have experience with the extra small pack size?

The Exos I have says it's for 16-19 inch torsos which is just too big for me. I absolutely love the Exos though and was looking at getting the Eja since it's the woman's version and comes in smaller sizing. Has anyone of similar torso length and hip size purchased the Eja WXS?

My friend will be thru-hiking the PCT NOBO. He anticipates hitting Whitney area in June and I'll meet him and we'll do a side trip to the peak. I would likely backpack a few days with him before or after as well but I'm worried about the logistics. Last time we hiked together, we were both thru-hiking so the worry of having a car and getting back to the car after the trip is new for me.

Some specific questions I have:

1. Are there multiple trails to the top? If so, which one is the trail that PCT hikers use to access the peak?
2. Are there trailheads nearby with parking options? Is there a way to get back to my car without hitching alone? I read something about a bus that goes to the area.. any information on that and if it's actually a good option? Side note here is that I'm open to using only public transportation if that's actually possible but I also like the idea of renting a car to be able to take hikers into town or provide trail magic as needed.

backpacking,Historically I’ve been a city backpacker never straying from civilisation for longer than a short day hike. However recently I’ve been interested in getting started on longer multi day wilderness hiking and after a long break from travel over Covid lockdowns I’ve decided nows the time to commit to that. I’ve been researching and accumulating gear for the past couple of months a tent and a pack being the last two major items I need to decide on. I don’t have a lot of money but after retiring my old travel pack due to wear my mum brought me the Roark Mule 55l for my last birthday. Based on my experience with travelling it seems like it’ll make a great travel pack but the company seems to be advertising it as usable for both city and outdoor travel adventures but I don’t know enough about hiking packs to know if this is true as it seem pretty different from a lot of the packs that more experienced hikers recommend. I’m happy to make a few small sacrifices to save some money but was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the cons of using this type of pack for hiking trips if there are any. I’m planning to start with a few shorter trips across Australia and New Zealand as this is home base but hopefully will be able to head overseas and experience the beauty of the outdoors across the world (i know that one pack is probably not going to last that long but… just for context),Roark mule 55l travel pack for multi day hiking trips???,,Booty_Flex,,2,2022-03-06 06:56:41

backpacking,"Hi! Im going to be backpacking in Belize (spending a lot of time in the rainforests, walking in very remote places over 5km a day) this summer and I need some recommendations for some lightweight breathable hiking boots.

I currently have some boots but they are very heavy winter waterproof type boots and I don't think they would be suitable because they can be quite restrictive, especially if im walking in rainforests with uneven paths. I still want to be able to be nimble and feel the ground. im looking for boots which are almost like running shoes, but with the extra ankle support. plus if they are extremely compact/lightweight and I can just stuff them into my backpack for the airport/plane ride or when im in civilisation. 

Ive found a couple pairs which might work but im not sure as they still look quite heavy. I would just wear running shoes but I would constantly be afraid of A) twisting my ankle and B) not having a good grip on the ground ( and C) also looking out of place when everyone else has nice boots lol) .

Any suggestions?

backpacking,"Hi,

I'm (22f) currently planning a solo backpacking trip through Latin and Central America. The duration is set for approx. 4 months (April to August '22). My dream would be to start in Chile in April and then slowly work my way up to Mexico for the next couple of months, arriving in Mexico in early July.

The countries I would definitely want to travel to are: Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. I might also want to visit Ecuador and El Salvador, while I'm already there.

I have previously lived in Mexico for a year, so I'm fluent in Spanish and also familiar with different regions there. I also have some friends I want to visit. I have collected some information on travelling and it seems to me that Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Panama and Costa Rica are relatively safe countries for travel (correct me if I'm wrong). 

My main concern is regarding the safety in Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. I would really love travelling on land for the whole journey from Chile to Mexico (if all borders are open), but am also unfamiliar with the situation in the aforementioned countries.

backpacking,"I recently purchased most of the expensive gear required for backpacking over winter and am hoping to be able to use my gear during my school's upcoming spring break. I had originally planned to do the Trans-catalina Trail, but was disappointed to find that the most important camp ground for the trip was completely booked for the entirety of my intended travel time an entire month and a half in advance. My backup plan of the Lost Coast Trail also seems to be booked during my free time. I was looking around at Joshua Tree, but find it to be a bit intimidating since it is out in the middle of the Mojave Desert with little to no water sources, so it doesn't seem like it would be the best option for first-time backpacking. I originally intended to have a group of 3 to go with, but the two people that I had planned with I believe will be backing out.

So, are there any recommendations in my situation for a last-minute 2-4 day backpacking trip in California for between 1-3 people? Thank you for your time.
