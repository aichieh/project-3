travel,"Not sure if best forum to ask, but here goes‚Ä¶. My Corp is sending me &amp; a +1 to an all-inclusive resort in MX in May for 3 nights as part of an awards thing, (list has ~175 ppl on it, figure 3/4 of them attend, plus some bigwigs, and roughly 1/2 of the resort taken over for the event). 

From day one of online registration we‚Äôd attend, (one month ago), I emailed the TA they‚Äôre using requesting room upgrades. After 12 days and a second email with no response I called. Said she was on it. 9 more days later, (and two more emails), I finally heard back &amp; authorized a Suite upgrade that‚Äôd result in ~$3.3k OOP for us, (still over half off public rates, all good). 

I reiterated our interest in a further upgrade, via cash or points (as it‚Äôs a chain I‚Äôve got plenty to spare), but understood higher categories weren‚Äôt in their contract, it‚Äôd be noted and who knows. Cool. But it‚Äôs been another 10 days, still no call for my CC info to pay the initial upgrade, despite more two emails over that time. 

I get she‚Äôs likely juggling a lot. But this is huge $ to us, and simply want to pay &amp; confirm we get what we want. And it‚Äôs only ~5 weeks away now. (The different TA they use for flights did our seat upgrades next day, ugh). 

How do I continue to push her to confirm &amp; take our $, while still being respectful of what she‚Äôs handling? I get my Corp is the client, but once I‚Äôm paying, I feel I am too. It‚Äôs been just under a month now, I‚Äôve never not had my ducks lined up so close to a major trip, (usually do our own thing, but even the two times I used a TA). How do I address this? There‚Äôs a lot on our plate for this trip, (putting an elderly parent we care for in an SNF for Alz, pet boarding, etc).

travel,"I wanted to ask to see if people have had similar experiences and how they felt about it? 

Basically I'm solo travelling in Australia. Driving around, free camping when I can etc and doing all there is to do as I go. 

I joined a ride shares and convoy traveller fb group to meet some like minded goers. I saw someone advertise they were looking for a ride from A to B, which happened to where I was headed, so I offered them to join! I did add that I wanted to stay the night en route and do a hike that I'd read about so if they didn't want to do that no worries we'll give it a miss. But no, they replied they thought that was a great idea, they'd love to come and they were really excited. Great! 

We get on the road! In total the drive was 12 hours and the stop off point was more or less half way through. At first I was thinking this is great to have some company and they seem easy going and not crazy so ideal! But after a while I found that I was the only one making conversation, not that we needed to speak every minute, but hey were having this brilliant experience exploring another country; having some time to chew the fat and get to know another person could be a fun experience. Plus, we had time to kill! But nevertheless they remained very quiet. 

I obviously consider that I am not an infallible human and maybe they thought they didn't like me too much or something? However, there was only chit chat about their studies and where we were from etc so there's not much I could have said that would have created a negative environment, objectively speaking. 

Anyway so we went through the whole journey barely talking because I eventually felt I'd annoy them if I kept making conversation. When we were setting off to do the hike I said if they didn't want to do it that was fine because they really didn't seem too interested! But they insisted they wanted to, so we hiked, in silence, for a day.  I decided that I would be myself so if I had something to say, I said it, but I didn't go out of my way to strike up a chat because they gave one word answers and seemed completely disinterested. 

I ended up looking forward to the end of that trip and parting ways. I felt I could've had more of a laugh by myself. 

We parted with no hostility. I'm not saying I expect to find a best pal on the off chance but what's the harm in some light hearted chat if you decide to travel with someone in a beautiful environment with no work or usual daily struggles to consider. 

I'm not sure I understand why someone would embark on a social rideshare if they were not interested with interacting. We met other people on the way and said person also did not interact with them either.

travel,"Hello,

My girlfriend and I are landing in Korea on May 9, landing in Osaka on May 15, and departing back home from Tokyo on May 29th. Apart from that, we know nothing about Asia aside from the basic research we have begun. I know that people take bullet trains to visit a lot of other cities and rural areas, and booking hotel accommodation is much cheaper on domestic websites.  


Aside from that, I want to book hotels soon rather than waiting for the last second when they will become much more expensive. Though to book hotels, I'm not even sure how we're going to distribute our trips across different cities, and it's gonna take a while to do enough research to plan that itinerary and then book hotels.  


So what do you guys think? What cities should we travel to and how many days should we do in each city? A rough thought was like 2 or 3 days in Osaka, 2 days in Kyoto, and the rest in Tokyo, but I heard there are even other cool cities. We're trying to find a cool mixed-gender hot spring / onsen too.

Dear Redditors,

I'll be flying to Vietnam via Singapore next week with Singapore Airlines next week. As I've been preparing for my trip I've noticed a small defect in my passport. 

The damage isn't really visible, but the data page is kind of detaching from it's binding in the corner (around 1,5cm, marked with a blue circle in the picture). The passport is 9 years old and has been heavily used so I guess it must be due to immigration agents swiping the MRZ in their scanners.

Unfortunately I'm not able to get it replaced as it takes around 1 month in Poland where I'm from

As the tear isn't really visible I'm hoping to not experience any problems, but I can't stop overthinking an am looking for some peace of mind (although it might also backfire I guess).

So here's the question: what are my chances to being denied boarding/entry to a country with this kind of defect in the ID page?

Day 4: Chianti Wineries Tour (Wine Tasting, because I want to feel bougie haha)

**Milan - **

(Oh geez, things are getting tricky here. I need more things to do in Milan it looks like. I should have gone to Venice but the low canals this year made me not want to go. I already booked my AirBNBs and my plane leaves in Milan. So I guess it *might* be too late to switch things up.)

* Jiufen - I've read that this isn't good for elderly, so I'm a little hesitant about this.
* Yangmingshan Park area - I guess it's mostly hiking and might not be good for my elderly parents? Also, I'm worried we might not appreciate it without a guide or something. 

I also considered those free walking tours, but they last for 2.5-3 hours. If it's too warm and sunny in Taipei next week, it's also not a good option for my parents (one has hypertension).

* It's my family's first time traveling abroad.
* My siblings just want something chill, and they don't want the itinerary to be jam-packed.
* I just want an activity we could do before we go to any of the night markets. (We need to go back to the hotel early because our flight is late at night.)

travel," Hi everyone,

I found some cheap ticket from LGW to Geneva for 60 quid so did some quick research and made up a itinerary for this upcoming long weekend. I have checked all the transport from Geneva all the way back to Newhaven and it seems feasible, at least for me. The reason I did not buy an return ticket from Genvea is because the ticket would cost 300-400 pound which would be too expensive for me. It's my first time going to Switzerland. Let me know your thoughts on my itinerary and I am open to any suggestions!

**Day 1: Arrive Geneva at 9am**

Place du Bourg-de-Four

Cath√©drale Saint-Pierre Gen√®ve Cr de Saint-Pierre, 1204 Gen√®ve

The Geneva Water Fountain Quai Gustave-Ador, 1207 Gen√®ve

Supermarket Lunch / Cook in hostel

Viaduc de la Jonction Chem. William-Lescaze 29, 1203 Gen√®ve

Plaine de Plainpalais

**Day 2: Geneva to Annecy/Lyon**

Walk around Annecy and take train back to Lyon for hostel (reason: 30min away from station)

**Day 3: Lyon to Dieppe**

Take 7am train from Lyon to Paris reach at 9:04am

Walk around Paris. I have visited last October so I am pretty comfortable here.

Buy tradition and comte and sit at a park

Take train to LaDefense (at 2pm)

Take bus from LaDefense to Dieppe (2:45pm - 5:30pm)

Book an Airbnb next to the ferry

travel,"We will be staying in G√ºndlischwand. Not interested in seeing jungfrauch or schilthorn. Going with family, and concern that it will be too much walk for my dad. he is in his 60s. Main things we will do are:

\- Day 1:  Walking/rent an eletric bike in Lautrebrunnen. Visit Staubbach falls. 

\- Day 2: Visiting Murren / Gimmewald / Wengen

\- Day 3: Visiting Grindewald, Grindewald First and lake balchapsee

We really want to see Manlichen, Schynige Platte  and Almendhubel, but realized the cable car going there will be close during our trip :-( Thats why not sure if buying Jungfrauch travel pass is a good idea.

However if I do end up buying it, I'm going to add a lake brienz boat trip, Kleine scheidegg and Harder Kulm in the trip. 

After calculating with above potential itinerary, using a car would be \~$150 cheaper which can be used either for eating out or renting a bike. And, we wouldn't have to carry the luggage for 15 min from  Zweil√ºtschinen train station.

But what I don't want to miss is the view from Lucern to Interlaken. I'm not sure if the view from the car would be similar with the train's view.

travel,"I made two hotel reservations for a trip, one directly and one via Priceline, both offering generous free cancellation policies.  I decided later to cancel the Priceline booking and keep the direct one. I have the email from Priceline stating the cancellation has been processed.

What I did not notice is that the hotel that charged my card directly was the one I booked via Priceline. I had thought it was the direct booking. They are both the same brand, and it's not clear from the subject line which hotel it is.

So checkout comes, I look at the folio, and I don't see any credit from a deposit. After checking my hotel and calling the other one, I learn that the deposit was for the other hotel, and their records do not show the room as cancelled. And because of that I never received a refund.

Whether it's a fault on Priceline not sending the cancellation or the hotel not processing it, I'll probably never know. Regardless, through no fault of my own, I am now missing a large chunk of money that I would very much like to have back. I have spoke to both the hotel and Priceline, and they also spoke with each other. They are supposedly going to be working out whose fault it is to refund me.

What I want to know is, what other steps can or should I be taking to protect myself and to receive my money?

I already contacted my credit card to see what my options are there, but will need to speak with the disputes department on Monday.

This July, I'm landing in Incheon International at 4:40pm on a Monday and will be departing before 8am. I hope to see as much of Korea as I possibly can with the little time that I have.

1) Leave to Seoul ASAP and check out either of the following areas---&gt; Cheonggyecheon Stream, Hongdae, Myeondong.  

2) take the last train back at midnight and explore Incheon  - *eg. paradise city? don't know where else*

My plan is:
Day 1: Visit Great Sand Dunes, start driving to Montrose in the evening, stay the night there
Day 2: Black Canyon of the Gunnison (south rim scenic drive, east portal road), start driving to Durango in the evening, stay the night there.
Day 3: Mesa Verde, back

What kind of advice or suggestion do you have for me? I have some questions:
1. Is it safe to drive (Great Sand Dunes to Montrose and then Black canyon to Durango) during the night? Also, I think we will miss the beautiful scenery of the million dollar highway in the night.
2. I know there are lots of beautiful mountain towns along the San Juan Skyway. There are so many options and so little time that I am kind of lost. Maybe we can make some NP stuff short to make room for other small town adventures?
3. Our hiking option is limited as there will be an infant with us. What are our options here? Is there any short and easy but good hikes in the NPs or the towns nearby?

1) Would we be Stopped at Delhi Airport as our return period extend 15 days?

2) Would we be granted VOA for 15 days at BKK or would be denied and sent back as our return tickets doesn't fall under the defined criteria of return tickets within 15 days.

My flight should be arriving at LHR on a Sunday morning at 10AM. There is a Tap Air Portugal flight leaving for Lisbon at 1:45 PM.

1 - Im aware that Canadians need a tourist visa there, but Air Canada provides that during the flight.  There is also the health declaration as of jan. 2022, but that is easy to find and do.  However I am vaguely remembering having to fill out a form at the airport and dont really remember what it is, and can't find out online exactly what it is either.  Does anyone know what Im thinking of or am I making false memories?

2 - Excursions - Last time I went I had zero idea that there were any day trips or what they were until I got there.  I also cant find anything online.  Since im traveling with air canada I assume they will be booked/offered under them but it would be nice to see something before I go.  The only one I can find online is from air transat and is 11 years old.  Does anyone know of where I can find a list?

 \-2b - Any suggestions on what to do or see?  There does seem to be quite a lot to do.  Im already starting to sift through google to try to narrow things down but I really do like the suggestions ive had from here.

3 - Bus - On Cayo Coco there was a tourist bus that routinely traveled around the island if you wanted to go out and explore.  Is it fair to assume there is one of these for the Varadero area?

4 - In Cayo Coco I got eaten alive by sand fleas/flies and have not been able to find a solution.  Anyone have any idea for repellant that works on these guys?

I left a message with their support team but clearly they won‚Äôt get back to me until their working hours again, if at all. It also doesn‚Äôt sound like they do VOA anymore, correct?

What are my options? My flight leaves around midnight. Do I hope that it will get approved again by the time I leave due to them being 14 hours ahead of me? Do I change my flight to leave a couple days later? Do I change it to fly into Thailand visa-free and then fly to Hanoi? Will I be allowed to board my flight and hope that I get the email approval during?

travel,"Hello there! I am looking for any advice on the reasonability/enjoyability of an upcoming trip to Northern Italy. My primary objective is to hike the Alta Via 2 in the Dolomites and stay in the mountain huts along the way. However, I would really like to take in some culture/cities (mainly Florence) and beaches if I have the time. I'd really appreciate any advice from anyone who has done a similar vacation!

I will be in Europe July 6 through 26th. This is very preliminary, but I have the following idea for an itinerary:

Jul 6: Arrive in Munich 2:00PM

Jul 6-8 (2 nights) Munich - I'd like to spend some time exploring the city, mostly drinking pilsner and eating. 

Jul 8 (travel day): 3.5hr train from Munich to Bressanone, Italy (start of Alta Via 2 hike). If possible, would like to stop in Innsbruck Austria for lunch/the afternoon

Jul 9 - 18 (10 days): Hike the Alta Via 2. I have read 11-13 days for the average hiker. I am a very fit amateur endurance athlete (trail runner, climber, hiker.) and am confident I can move very quickly in the mountains. Absolutely no problem hiking 15 -20 mile (24 - 32km) days between huts. 

Based on a comment on a blog (I know not the best research): ""experienced/fit hikers carrying a lightish load can comfortably do the hike in six or seven days. I tend to avoid using myself as a barometer in most of the website‚Äôs articles, but I comfortably did it in six, which included breakfasts and lunches in the huts. The latter of which were usually drawn-out affairs involving multiple courses and alcoholic beverages. It was a very relaxed trip and I wasn‚Äôt exactly on the clock"" 

I am thinking 10 days will allow me to comfortably and leisurely complete the hike. I want to take some side summit climbs and enjoy an espresso or two at the huts, not just mad dash through the whole thing. 

Jul 19 (travel day and explore Venice): 1 hr bus ride from end of Alta Via 2 to Venice. Spend the day in Venice, either stay in Venice or find a later bus (2 hours) to Florence.

Jul 20 - 21: 1-2 nights in Florence

Jul 22 - 23: travel to and hike the cinque terre, spending 2 nights in the villages there. 

Jul 23:2 hr bus to Genoa, 1 night in Genoa

Jul 24 - 26: early flight to London, spend 2 nights in London, 8am flight back to US on the 26th.

Do you think this is over ambitious or will feel rushed. I travel light and don't mind checking in and out of places often, but also do want to feel like I have enough time to enjoy the cities at a leisurely pace. I will be taking public transportation the entire time. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! I'd also skip Venice if it helps spend more time on the coast/ if Florence is worth my time, but its so close to the end of the hike, figure its worth a quick stop.",Advice on itinerary for 20 days in Dolomites/Northern Italy,,bpip18,,1,2023-03-31 17:49:15

travel," I‚Äôve never really understood the term ‚Äúwanderlust‚Äù until my luggage decided to take on the spirit of adventure, and [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html) saved the day.

Last year, I had planned a wonderful vacation to Rome. I was excited to explore the ancient city, eat copious amounts of pizza, and practice my terrible Italian. But as fate would have it, my luggage decided to take a detour and explore the world on its own.

When I arrived at the baggage claim carousel in Rome, I waited‚Ä¶and waited‚Ä¶and waited some more. It‚Äôs funny how the carousel always seems to have a mind of its own. It teases you with the illusion of luggage coming around the bend, only to reveal that it‚Äôs not yours, and the waiting game continues.

After what felt like an eternity, it dawned on me that my suitcase had decided to go rogue. I approached the baggage service desk, and the attendant informed me that my luggage had been mistakenly sent to Madrid. To be honest, I was a little jealous. My suitcase was out there, living its best life, while I was stuck in Rome without any clean clothes or toiletries.

While the thought of my suitcase sunbathing in Madrid without me was amusing, the reality of the situation was less so. I was understandably upset and worried, but the wonderful staff at [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html) assured me that they‚Äôd get my suitcase back to me as soon as possible. They even offered me a complimentary amenity kit and some funds to purchase essential items, a gesture that truly made me feel cared for.

As I ventured into Rome without my luggage, I couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle at the thought of my suitcase going on a wild adventure of its own. I imagined it taking selfies with the locals, trying tapas, and maybe even learning a bit of Spanish. It‚Äôs funny how life sometimes throws curveballs, but when you‚Äôre flying with [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html), you can be sure that they‚Äôre always there to catch them.

In the end, my luggage was returned to me, safe and sound, and reunited with its rightful owner (me!) in just 48 hours. And while it‚Äôs still unclear whether or not my suitcase picked up any Spanish during its brief sojourn in Madrid, I do know one thing for certain: the next time I‚Äôm planning a trip, I‚Äôll be booking with [Qatar Airways](https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100816724-11555309?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qatarairways.com%2Fen-my%2Fhomepage.html). After all, they‚Äôve already proven that they‚Äôll go the extra mile to ensure my wanderlust-filled luggage and I can explore the world together.

Just remember that if you ever find yourself in the unfortunate situation where your luggage decides to embark on a solo trip, don‚Äôt panic! Here‚Äôs what you should do:

First, take a deep breath and remember that most lost luggage does eventually find its way home. Next, head to the baggage service desk and report your missing suitcase. The staff will be able to track your wayward belongings and provide updates on their whereabouts. While you‚Äôre waiting for your luggage reunion, treat yourself to some essential items (and perhaps some comfort snacks). After all, it‚Äôs not every day that your suitcase gets to experience life outside the confines of an airplane‚Äôs cargo hold. And finally, don‚Äôt forget to keep a positive attitude and see the humor in the situation. Your luggage may be off gallivanting around the world, but at least it‚Äôs giving you a hilarious story to tell when you get back home. Just remember, life is full of unexpected adventures, and sometimes, it‚Äôs your luggage that leads the way.

this July, my partner and I will be going to Europe to spend 3 weeks (1st-21st).

We have bought a multi city pass flying from LAX to √Åmsterdam and from Venice back to LAX.

2nd-6th in Amsterdam 
6th-12th in Paris
12th/13th-15th in Alsace
16th-21st in Venice 
We plan on staying in hostels, hotels and with our friends in Alsace.

travel,"Hey Everyone,

My girlfriend and I (from the US) are going to Europe this summer for about three weeks. Our basic itinerary is that we are flying into Zurich, traveling around Switzerland for four days, heading to Budapest for probably five days, then to Romania for 2-3 days, and finally ending up in Greece for another 3-4 days before flying out of Athens back to the US. We want to try to travel as light as possible considering we'll be moving around so much and don't want to lug a large bag around.

&amp;#x200B;

We have the general ideas of places we want to go, and even bought the Swiss Travel Pass so we're really going to be doing a lot of moving around Switzerland the first few days which would make it a super big PITA to try to drag luggage.   


So, question for you pros, how would we best get away with traveling light? We're really not people who need a lot of things other than some changes of clothes and such. The modifier here, is that we also don't want to check bags on the flights because that is not only expensive, but could turn out to be a nightmare if anything is lost and I've lost baggage multiple times on flights just within the US, so I don't trust baggage checking anyway.

I'm going to be working remotely through the first three countries as I've done in the past, and taking the entire time we're in China off when visiting my partner's extended family (~2 weeks).

I've not been to China before, and I've read so many worrying posts on more tech-focused subreddits about how you should never bring any electronics you care about into China, and to only use burner devices there. Mainly from a security perspective with your data and privacy, but also potentially from a confiscation standpoint too.

I'll have my laptop (with an encrypted drive), Steam Deck, Sony mirrorless camera, and two phones (main iPhone, and an older backup Android phone for local SIMs) with me on this trip, and my partner will have their iPad and iPhone with them. Do I need to worry about bringing these devices into China? 

We'll be transiting through Taiwan both coming in and out of Xiamen in China, should I find a way to stash most of our electronics in Taipei somehow and just bring in my Android phone? If we do bring everything with us, I plan on leaving everything powered off the whole time except our phones roaming on US carriers.

I guess I have no idea how paranoid I need to be realistically, and what likelihood there will be issues entering and exiting China with our devices. I get those tech focused subs will be on the more paranoid side of the spectrum based on the worst possible scenario, but I'm curious to hear traveler's perspectives too who have actually been there.

travel," Hey all, I'm currently planning a 10-day horse trekking trip in Mongolia and looking for more people to join me on this group tour! The dates are from Jun 19th - Jun 28th, 2023. Since I'm really fascinated with the history of the Mongols and Genghis Kahn, I decided to plan a trip that will hit many of the major historical sites, like Lake Khokh where Genghis Kahn was entitled as Kahn and Khuduu Aral where the Secret History of Mongols was written. Of course, no Mongolian trip can be complete without horseriding, so the tour includes 5-6 days of riding as well (at least beginner level required) through Khentii National Park .

I'm a solo traveller and I'd love to have more people join me to make the group tour happen. The price for 3 pax is $2,457USD per person. I'm hoping we can get more people to lower the price even more. I know it's quite expensive, but going on tours is kind of the only way to see the Mongolian steppe since it has no roads and is difficult to navigate by yourself. Anyway, if you're intersted, see the Google Docs link below for the itinerary details. : )

A bit about myself: I'm Taiwanese and grew up in Taiwan, Denmark, and the U.S. Being mobile in my childhood made me want to keep traveling for my adult life, so I spend half a year working and the other half exploring new countries and meeting new people. I love birdwatching, history, writing fiction, and climbing on things. I hope that this will be a chance to hang out with other travelers as well!

Then, he said he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt get the pass‚Äù and asked if we would be okay with paying him in cash outside the Uber app. At this point I pulled the plug because things were super sketch. We ended up finding another Uber like 20 minutes later with no mention of the pass.  


One of our triad has spent the past few hours contending that there was nothing to worry about and that this had to be some weird local regulation he wasn‚Äôt prepared for. He argues that this driver‚Äôs decision to effectively collateralize his high (4.96) uber rating suggests that this was some honest error, but the other two of us are really skeptical.

Hey Friends. I am headed to Brazil at the end of August - September for 3 weeks and have a few things booked at the beginning, but am looking for suggestions of what to do at the end of the trip. (Solo F - 33yrs)

I fly into SP and booked a flight for a couple hours after I land, to Rio for 4 nights, 3 full days. From there I'm hittin a plane ride to Iguazu Falls, where I will be for 3 nights and 2.5 days. From there, I'm catching an early flight to Salvador de Bahia where I want to hang for about 3ish days. This is where I'm a bit stuck with my remaining 9 days. 

I'm  thinking about three options but am VERY open to any and all suggestions:  
1. I could head to Recife for about 3 days before heading to Fernando de Noronha for 4-5 nights before heading back to SP to fly home.   
2. Going to Chapada Diamantina for 4ish+ days, and then head to Recife for about 3-4 days and hit the beaches around there; issue here is I feel like 12+ hours on a bus (round trip) is a lot of time wasted in transport but it looks incredible!

Context: 

I'm in the US, my carrier is Verizon, my phone (Pixel 6) is able to use an eSIM (pretty sure, anyway). I'll be visiting Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, and France. Currently considering the Airalo European 3GB/30 days plan.

Questions:

* With Airalo, since I'll only have data, I can use WhatsApp, Signal, maps, browse Reddit, email, etc. but can*not* use regular ol' SMS or phone calling. Right?
* How does making calls via WhatsApp work? Can I do that with Airalo? Is that included in the data I pre-purchased? What phone number does it use?
* I also see Google Fi recommended a fair bit. The plan with international calling and whatnot is $40 a month. I won't come remotely close to needing an unlimited plan, so is there any other reason why I should still consider Google Fi over Airalo?

travel,"Hello

I'm a 17 y/o highschooler who is about to graduate. As a gift, my mom is taking me to explore some of Europe. Most of the trip it will just be me walking around by myself as my mom will have to work from hotel rooms. I'm planning on going for about 23 days from late march to late June. It will probably be closer to 21 full days in Europe once traveling time is subtracted. 

I guess what I'm asking for is what places can I go where I can just explore relatively safely as a minor. I'm also looking for how many countries I should try and squeeze in, as id like to explore more than one but I also don't want to spend too little time in an area to the point where it doesn't really feel like I've been there. For reference here are the European countries I've been to before as well as the ones I wouldn't be apposed to going to again.

Countries ive been: Iceland, Uk, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Italy, Croatia, Albania, and Greece 

Countries id like to explore more: Switzerland, Italy, Greece

Id like most the countries I visit to be ones I've been to before, but like I said I would be fine spending a little bit more time there. So far, my mom has put forward this route along the railroad:

travel,"Hi, 

I'm going on vacation end of may and was wondering which city to visit. My initial plan was to spend 3 days in Barcelona, 1 in Madrid, and 3 in Seville. But I've heard some great things about the Alhambra and now im debating if I should visit Granada instead. Also heard great things about Valencia. 

So I'm curious to know... Which city would you visit for 1 night? 

For context, bf and I are in our late 20s, enjoy the historical architecture, culture and love food. We are not so much in the club scene, but would enjoy going to a tapa or watching the sunset at a park in the evening.

travel,"Hi all!

I'm about to start my solo travels shortly, for about a year, to South East Asia, Oceana, and South America.

I wanted to get people's thoughts on footwear, in particular the Hoka Mach 5 as a daily shoe (never owned a Hoka before). I have slightly wider feet and a higher mid-foot than the average person I would say, so I'll probably go to a specialist store for additional insight just in case, but wanted to get the expert opinion here.

My use case would mainly be for walking. I also was considering trail runners such as the Adidas Terrex line, but because some of my trails later in the year might be more challenging (such as Machu Picchu), I am considering separate hiking footwear. While versatility for light trails would obviously have been good, I think that I am good with sacrificing this for more comfort for day-to-day slow travel -  I assume an Adidas Terrex would be less comfortable walking than a Hoka for example. I do not mind packing an additional pair of footwear as going ultralight is not as big of a priority as comfort for me and my backpack has enough space to accommodate this.

In summary, I'm happy (and currently leaning towards) getting a pair of trainers, sandals, and hiking footwear, and day-to-day comfort is what I wanted to prioritise for my main/daily shoe.

Any insight would be much appreciated!",Footwear Recommendations - Hoka Mach 5 to solo travel for a year?,,LightningV1,,0,2023-03-30 22:30:21

(Basically the Canadian military said sisters arent important enough only mommies and daddies can go, and we do not talk to ours.) She still wants me to go, but flight prices are INSANE.

Basically, where I live in Eastern Canada, it costs ‚âà$400+ to fly anywhere than it would from Montreal or Toronto, so I've been looking at flights out of those 2 cities.(From my city to Athens it *says* it's $1465 RT but everytime I go to book it it goes up to $1697).

The cheapest flight that I've been looking at from Toronto to Athens RT is only $1099, but it has a 24 hour layover in Montreal both ways. I live close enough to Montreal that I can drive relatively cheaply, so if I could fly out of Montreal for this price that would be perfect. Otherwise I'd have to buy a separate RT to Toronto (‚âà$200)

BUT if I search for the same flights just without the Toronto part, it goes up to $1349 RT, from just Montreal to Athens, which is incredibly frustrating. 

I'm like. A super poor person that lives paycheck to paycheck and does some slightly sketchy things just to get groceries every month, so this trip is seriously going to hurt me financially. My hopes were so high knowing I'd have a chance to go to Europe and then they pulled it out right underneath me and I feel like a complete fool. I feel bad for my sister who already booked the hotel and everything for the 2 weeks she has off and we've been planning this for forever since it's her only break in 6 months so I feel like I can't back out of it. I'm also sick as fuck of the only travel advice online being ""book years in advance!"" Or ""save $ by not eating out!"". I'm lucky I have 1.5 months advance, and eating out is simply something I never do since I can only afford to live off of oatmeal and PB toast.

A few days after what happened at the hotel, I reached out to Priceline throughout my holiday multiple times through text and email to try and find some resolution. One of the Priceline representatives went so far and claimed that there were attempts made to contact me of the
cancellation and that I even authorized and approved this cancellation. When asked for records of these contact attempts, the
representative dismissed my request and essentially told me ‚Äútoo bad too sad.‚Äù I also tried submitting an formal complaint via Pricelines feedback website and they said ""We reviewed your issue again to confirm that we did not overlook anything that might support a more favorable resolution."" üòí

Anyways, I was also going back and forth with the hotel corporate office regarding what exactly had happened and I hadn't heard back from the travel insurance company yet. According to the hotel, the reservation was cancelled bc ""There was an issue with the rate being confirmed on the travel agent system and the hotel is not able to accept the
booking since the rate is incorrect,"" which sounds like Priceline just made up their own price?? WTF. 

After coming back from my trip, I looked into some of the legal options such as small claims and arbitration and then I came across the BBB (just google priceline BBB or expedia BBB, etc). I'm not sure how it works exactly but it is a free service and it seems like they act as a mediator between the 2 parties. I saw other peoples complaints and the resolutions provided and figured I would try it before taking the legal route. Side note, I also submitted a complaint against Expedia for an incident that happened last year, which was resolved very quickly and I got a full refund from them. 

After some back and forth with Priceline, they offered to refund the difference between the original booking and the new booking (~$460) in the form of a check. I tried asking for a refund for the full amount since I had to spend my holiday with limited funds and I wasnt able to get the full experience of my trip, but they said no. üôÑ

At any rate, I was able to recover the out of pocket expense without going the legal route, so not a total loss. I just have to wait for the check to come in the mail. I still haven't heard from the travel insurance as they are really backed up....

I hope this helps others, but ultimately, lesson learned, I'm definitely staying tf away from these companies. üôÅ",UPDATE My hotel reservation was cancelled and nobody told me,,Worried-Fun-6072,,0,2023-03-30 20:02:17

He is really active and healthy (plays tennis several times a week) but sometimes when he walks for extended periods, he has knee pain and lower back pain. I am trying to think of ways he will be able to fully participate in the trip even if he is experiencing pain. One thought is a manual Razor scooter (we used these for the kids when they were ages 4-10/12 and it went well but this was in NYC and DC not Europe), it would save him steps and we can easily fold it up and carry it when we are on public transport or in museums, etc‚Ä¶Has anyone tried anything like this in Europe? Or maybe even a skateboard? I want to buy it now so he has some weeks to practice. Any ideas or advice very welcome, this is my kids (19 and 21) first real European trip and he will be sad if he causes any restrictions.

**Option A**
-Train from Budapest to Salzburg, 2 nights in Salzburg
-Train from Salzburg to Vienna, 4 nights in Vienna
-Day trip from Vienna to Hallstatt during the 4 nights stayed in Vienna.

**Option B**
-Train from Budapest to Vienna, 2 nights in Vienna
-Train from Vienna to Salzburg, 2 nights in Salzburg
-Travel from Salzburg to Hallstatt (day trip), Hallstatt to Vienna, 2 nights in Vienna.

My thoughts: I am siding towards Option A. While we would be passing through Vienna on a longer train ride en route to Salzburg, I am not crazy about the idea of setting up in a city, leaving after 2 days, just to come back 2 days later.

I actually already know the things I'd like to visit, but was courisous to ask would it be by any means ""weird"" if I'd travel all the way from Europe to visit only the town? Because the last time I went to Montreal, CBSA was pretty suspicious that I travelled all the way to Canada ""just to visit Montreal"".

&amp;#x200B;

In short: Starting from Singapore, I want to travel back home to Berlin without going by plane.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve figured out 2 routes + 1 alternative, which seem to be doable. These are not final yet though, since I might want to stay a few days in some places or visit some more. For the routes, I just focused on finding a way home. In general, I‚Äôd rather take the train than going by bus, even if it is a little more expensive (but not overly expensive) or takes more time. I also wanted to avoid going to Russia.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_zVg2KZfXBckAvVjiAiQvHFFs5zzti5ZWk28ePZn4o/edit?usp=sharing) with the most important information (I‚Äôm quite proud of it tbh \^\^‚Äô)

Route 2 would probably be my most desired route, since I always wanted to visit Nepal, but it got quite some gaps in the public transportation department with the biggest problem being, that there isn‚Äôt really a good way to cross the border between Myanmar and India by public transport. I could imagine myself going to hike to the Nepal-China border (if possible, of course).

Route 1 &amp; 2 share the same big public transport gap between Aktau and Kuryk.

Route 1.5 would be the alternative, since it would include Nepal and avoid any big transportation gaps. But I would have to take the plane back home to Berlin.

&amp;#x200B;

The most information for this has been gathered through [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) and [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/index.html).

I you guys have any ideas for a better route or even solutions for my transport gaps, please feel free to share them. Also, feedback and other recommendations are appreciated too.

&amp;#x200B;

*One more thing:*

For now, I‚Äôve been planning just for myself, but if anybody is interested, I‚Äôm looking for travel buddies, that might be crazy enough to join my journey. Feel free to contact me :)

travel,"Hey everyone!

I have a quick question about my US passport.

Backstory: I am a US/Italy citizen, flying from the US back to Italy. I DON'T have an Italian passport, only an American one. A

About three and a half months ago, I applied to have my American passport renewed online (which means I keep my old passport rather than send it in). This is when the maximum expected wait time was 9 weeks, which gave me a comfortable 3 extra weeks in case it was late. Because it hadn't arrived earlier this week, I followed procedure on the State Department website and called the number to have them expedite it. I was told it should be done within a few days. That was Monday, and there is no change today (Thursday). 

My question is: Does anyone know if I can fly on a passport that isn't expired? I can't find information on the State Dept website as to whether or not the passport becomes invalid as soon as I apply for a new one.

Follow up: This is pure hope, but does the State Dept issue and ""Whoops, our bad, this person can actually fly"" document in cases like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't imagine I'll have much, if any, trouble getting back into Italy since I have an ID card, and that's all I've needed every other time I have made the trip. But they might not let me leave is the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I can't just wait until the passport is ready. I have obligations in Italy and I can't extend my stay in my sublet in the States.

We did the reservation, all good, reservation confirmed. After a few hours (we were already sleeping) apparently we received an email saying that, for technical reasons, our flight reservation had been cancelled and that in the next 3/5 days they would proceed with a full refund. I called [booking.com](https://booking.com/) support and they didn't manage to provide any additional context, and we wanted to know whether this happened to anyone else? Was the issue with the airline? Should we just avoid this specific airline to mitigate future similar issues?

travel,"Hello all! We are an American couple who is traveling to Switzerland in late July. Specifically, we are headed to Bern to play tennis in the Eurogames 2023, an event during which LGBTQ+ athletes gather to play sports and celebrate pride.

I'm writing here to ask for recommendations as to a possible itinerary. We will likely be flying into Z√ºrich on Friday, July 21st. The tournament starts in Bern on Wednesday, July 26th and the last day is Saturday, July 29th which coincides with BernPride. We'll probably fly home the next day on Sunday, July 30th.

I realize that it's a really short and awkward time between arriving in Z√ºrich and needing to be in Bern, but we'd really like to make the most of it if possible. Obviously we won't be able to ""see it all,"" but any recommendations, advice, or tips would be much appreciated.

travel,"Hello! We are two lady artists (composer and painter) that are taking a Europe trip. 

We are medium-packers; we have our creative supplies and our personal things, so we're not packing light enough to be backpacking for instance. Because of our gear, I'd prefer to do only several moves, not many frequent ones.

We booked an apartment in Bologna for a month to be able to have a hub for work and to be able to spoke out for 1-2 day trips to neighboring cities. This way, we could even leave most of our things and pack an overnight bag. We feel confident about that portion of the trip.

We're wondering if we should pick another hub area for the \~18 days before we are in Bologna, or move between a couple places for about a week or so.

Would like to stay around $6,000 for 2 people, three weeks in June, including places to stay, food, fun, and any smaller transit (short flights, intercity trains).

I think hostels COULD work for some of our stays, but only ones where I can secure my violin &amp; electronics. AirBnB's, mid-range hotels, or private rooms could be good options.

Some areas of consideration:

* Zagreb &amp; Dubrovnik, Croatia
* Paris
* Lisbon
* Naples

We definitely want to do a short trip to Naples if we don't end up staying there longer, but it could be after our Bologna stay.

travel,"I had a reservation for an international flight tomorrow morning. It was a two leg trip, the first flight was delayed by 90 mins which meant I would miss my connection for the second flight. The airline offered alternatives, but I contacted them (via their website chat) to ask about getting an aisle seat and possibly a free upgrade to a comfort seat as there were no aisle seats available on the alternate flights. Somehow the agent in the chat canceled and refunded my reservation without my permission and without any confirmation. I only learned about this when I called the airline after the chat agent tried to transfer me to a ticket specialist and never heard anything.

I'm on hold now with the airline trying to find me a comparable flight but I don't think they'll be able to find anything for the price I initially paid seeing as this is now a next-day international flight and they say they are unable to price match since my original reservation was refunded. There are also no return flights for my original dates which means I'll either lose out on money spent for my accommodations by coming back early or need to spend more money on accommodations coming back later.

I've never heard of anything like this before and it's not the typical flight cancellation by the airline. The flights are still there but my reservation was canceled without my consent or permission. Am I entitled to anything here?? I might miss the whole trip (and the money spent on accommodations) because of this.

Since we will be traveling some on trains, we want to travel light. The entire trip is 3 weeks but we will have accomodations where we can do laundry.

My wife has a 25"" Travelpro suitcase that has great wheels on it even after many years. So we wanted to get some smaller carry-on sized Travelpro (Crew) spinners with really good wheels. This will allow us to walk a mile or so from train stations to lodging, also make it easier to travel light on trains.

So question - Travelpro isn't that cheap compared to our previous Samsonite/etc. They seem to have 22"", 21"", and 20"" rollers/spinners. We checked out the 22 and 21 and compared their dimensions to the official luggage allowances for carryons with our airlines and even the 21 is ***technically*** too large when including wheels. Yet getting down to the 20"", that is pretty tiny.

We could check our rollers on the flights and still be light for the trains, but it would be nice to just carry them onto our flights.

travel,"Hello. 

So long story short. I have nearly 30K in the bank. And I am currently 27 years old and have never lived on my own. My college years and adolescent years in short have haunted to me to this day. If I sound overdramatic. I apologize but how it went down still bothers me. And if you're wondering, I've been dealing with immense mental health issues since the pandemic. Counseling is ongoing. 

I want a setting where I can be free of any responsibility. I desire a setting where yes. I can have irresponsible immature and youthful fun. Basically, I want a space where I can feel like the 19 year old I never got to be even if it is for a very brief moment. 

I'll be real. The reason traveling and staying in hostels appeal to me is simply cause they resemble a college dorm room. 

Will it exactly be like college? I know that is a hard no. And I know I won't really make any long term friendships from this. And you know what? I don't desire to. I am in no mood for anything serious in my life right now. Frankly, I don't care if I whomever is staying in my hostel is a doctor and I don't care to know about that person's career. I've had an incredibly sheltered life so far, and the only thing I care about is having fun. Again, being the 19 and 21 year old I never got to be is my priority. I want that type of fun I wanted my college years should of been. I don't care how shallow and meaningless the partying is. Pleasure is the only thing I desire right now. 

I have doubts if my 30K will last me more than a year but I'll try to make the most of what I got. I have thought about pursuing being a paralegal or aviation after if I go down this route. 

I know I can't be 18 or 20 anymore but I am desperate to have some ""self serving compensation"" for those times I have missed. If I can get something out of this, then I can promise the world around me that I'll grow up. 

My apologies if this is juvenile. The truth is yeah. I am juvenile. And I am desperate to be juvenile. If you want to label me an asshole that is okay too. 

So. My question is, does this route suit me? How long realistically will my 30K last me?",Could solo traveling serve as a compensation for the college experience I missed out on?,,BloodyBloodshot,,0,2023-03-29 23:23:21

I feel that travel isn‚Äôt really for me. I‚Äôm 28, and really haven‚Äôt had many opportunities to travel before. I can count how many times I‚Äôve been on a plane with one hand, and have never left North America.

While I always wanted to travel when I was young, it just didn‚Äôt happen. My family really couldn‚Äôt afford it, and I‚Äôve never been able to just leave my job and go somewhere for weeks at a time. There also seems to be kind of an annoying ‚Äúculture‚Äù among traveling that rubs me the wrong way. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly having to hear from coworkers and acquaintances about all of the places they‚Äôve gone (with the conversation usually turning into some sort of competition to see who has gone to more places or traveled more). Some may even give you a hard time if you tell them that you don‚Äôt travel. I used to be ashamed by it when I was a kid, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as it used to. 

My partner is from a country in Asia, and she really wants me to go there on a vacation with her. I could see myself traveling with her, but at the same time I could take it or leave it. I‚Äôm good with just staying home or letting her do it herself. I also worry about what could go wrong (getting lost, having a health problem abroad, etc) and it just seems easier for me not to go.

travel,"If you're planning to fly with Turkish Airlines anytime soon, you might want to think twice after hearing about my experience with them. I recently took a flight from San Francisco to Mumbai and back, and let's just say that it wasn't the smoothest ride I've ever had.

For starters, on one of my flights, they separated me and my travelling partner on one leg of the flight. This was a major problem for us because my partner has mobility issues and need6ed assistance. They wheeled him away, and we were supposed to meet at the next gate. However, when we reunited, I found out that he had purchased a business class upgrade for $1300, after they told him it was $300. The flight attendants were of no help, so I contacted customer service. Unfortunately, it's been two weeks, and I haven't received a response yet.

To add insult to injury, on all the legs of my flight, the ""extra legroom"" seats I had paid extra for all had bassinets for babies. The airline neglected to mention this when I purchased them on the phone. As a result, I was asked to move to a normal sized seat on two out of four flights so that a family could sit together. 
On the other two flights, I had a baby right in front of me, one of which was unfortunately very sick. I contracted COVID-19 after that flight, despite wearing a mask. The baby's caregivers were asleep most of the time, and the baby often rested his head on my shoulder, which was not a pleasant experience.
I was not mad at the baby, poor little guy. 

When I asked for a refund for the extra legroom seats I gave up, the airline claimed they had no record of me being asked to move and refused to provide a refund. So they denied my request. 

 I also had issues with my meal request - I had ordered a vegan meal, but all my dishes had cheese. When I informed the stewards and stewardesses, they insisted it was vegan, even though it wasn't. 

I wrote to customer service about this, and they requested a note from my doctor stating that I am vegan, which I found odd. I did provide the note, to which they then responded, ""issue resolved'. 

Overall, the flight was decent, but the customer service was abysmal. The responses I received seemed as though they were written by people who love the books of Franz Kafka. 

It's disappointing that I couldn't talk to anyone about my issues, and the fact that they neglected to mention the bassinets in the ""extra legroom"" seats was unacceptable.

 If you're flying with Turkish Airlines, my advice would be to not rely on the on-board flight attendants to resolve any issues and brace yourself for a frustrating experience.",turkish airlines worst customer service ever?,,dylalien23,,0,2023-03-29 22:26:33

 We are planning to stay in hostles but are unsure about the ability of 17 year olds to book/check into them, some say that you only have to be older then say 14 and some dont specify. We know it will vary from hostle to hostle. Are they very strict about the age and how do they verify it, if it is a strict process how common are hostles that accomadate youth?

travel,"Hi everyone,

So I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on where to travel in the Caribbean between December and January.

So my gf and I are planning on escaping the dark european winter months for a while and spend 3 weeks in the Caribbean Sea. It‚Äôs the first time for us around there.
The rainy season seems to be over by then and I guess the weather should be fine at the turn of the year.

Activity wise we‚Äôd like to go hiking and see some nature, snorkelling but a day or two at the beach are welcome as well. Experiencing local cuisine is definitely on our list too.

Our main questions are:

1. Which islands are accessible by flight from europe?
2. Are the islands properly linked by boats? And is it easily possible to arrive at one point and leave from another island?
3. What are the expenses to expect in comparison to southeast asia for exemple?
4. What's generally useful to know before going there?
5. Which are the points that were disappointing? (if there are any) and what's to avoid?

Any advice towards which islands and/or  travel routes are recommendable for 3 weeks of time and which places to stay at are highly appreciated!
I‚Äôd say we are travelling on a medium budget. I worked enough to not spend the night in a 20 people dorm, however we‚Äôd like to avoid paying 6k for a week in a fancy suit.

* I want to choose between one of those five countries: South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and Philippines
* Duration: 1 month
* Time period: January, February, March or April
* City and countryside oriented 
* Not really interested in beach or nightlife
* Mostly want to visit historical sites, try a ton of food
* Accessible transportation methods (can't walk much or stay up for a long time because of health condition)
* More physical stuff like hiking or climbing is not doable. However, activities like kayaking would be fine since legs aren't really required.
* On the cheaper side if possible
* English is usable in a worst case scenario
* Friendly and easy to talk to people would be really nice
* Safe, I would like to leave more touristic places and go see what life in the countryside look like without having to worry too much

I swear these people who are saying this either were in the worst locations of Cairo, or have never travelled in a country who has haggling. 

First of all. Uber is Cairo has been a breeze. And SO CHEAP! From downtown Cairo to the pyramids it cost a total of $3. Uber drivers for me have been nice older men in nicer cars than the taxi. 

The pyramids, there is a lot of people selling carriage and camel rides. But if you just say ‚Äúno‚Äù in Arabic and don‚Äôt answer where your from then they will leave you alone quickly. It was not as bad as people say. 

Cairo has been great, we walked 10 miles (16 kilo meter) around town and have been just fine!People have been very nice. At night is wild because Ramadan. 

Don‚Äôt let bloggers scare you off or make you anxious. Use Uber, say no, and enjoy yourself. Cairo is a massive city with a ton of people and in every city you will have good people and you will have bad people and Cairo is no different.

I'll be traveling for about a month (32 days), and I plan to stay for at least 4 days in the 5 cities I have friends in (sums up to 20 days). That leaves in about 10 days to spent in other cities.

What I'm not sure if it really makes sense to spend 4 days in a single place (I don't really need this much time to see my friends), and also how many cities I can fit in these 30 days that makes to a healthy trip with enough days to have a good time in each city.

travel,"Hey guys

I'm thinking of going to Turkey end of the year. 

So far.. I've got this plan:
- 6 days Kadikoy, Istanbul
- 5 days Cappadocia (split between Goreme / Ortahisar)
- 1 day Antalya (out of necessity with late flights.. just wanting to get to Kas.. is there a way to get there without the overnight stay here?)
- 4 days Kas 
- 2 days Karakoy, Istanbul (before the long journey home)

I'm pretty okay with the above. Just a bit unsure with the trip from Cappadocia to Kas to Istanbul. Wasn't planning to go but the Reddit reviews are too flattering! From what I've researched, it'd be best to stay in Antalya and then bus/drive to Kas the next morning? 

Also.. what's the best route from Kas back to Istanbul? I've read it's possible from both Dalaman and Antalya. 

Would bus or car hire be best? 

Would love to know if anyone has traveled this route and their thoughts on what's the best option to get from place to place?

Many thanks in advance!",Turkey travels.. Cappadocia to Kas to Istanbul..,,Particular-Thought53,,2,2023-03-29 11:55:02

We‚Äôve just started planning our first trip to Italy as a family for late July/ early August. It‚Äôll be my wife, 18 month old daughter and myself! 

We have a total of 11 days in Italy and looking to check out as much as possible but not rushed, travelling with a kid slows you down significantly haha! 

So far we had in mind the below path 

Rome -&gt; Naples -&gt; somewhere in Puglia (open to suggestions) -&gt; Florence -&gt; fly out of either Milan or Rome. 

My family love our food and also beautiful sights and sounds. We aren‚Äôt big on night life and would most likely not be driving unless necessary. We‚Äôve heard train travel between big towns is best so that‚Äôs what we are leaning towards. Our budget is middle class if that makes sense lol, nothing overly fancy but also willing to spend on nice experiences!

Traveling in the US is expensive.

Even bad motels in the middle of nowhere cost shy of $100 bucks. You obviously need a car, and cities have no wow-factor besides a few ones, and the cuisine is also not abundantly amazing or cheap (example: $25 for a lobster roll vs a buffer of amazing cuisine in Mexico or Thailand).

The amazing nature highly compensates for it imo, but do you think if say, you had $40k for travel, it would make sense to spend it traveling the US rather than abroad?

Two questions come to mind that I'm hoping to get some guidance on here

* **Visa &amp; letter of invitation:** As a US citizen, I know that I can go through the e-Visa process that seems fairly straightforward. I'm trying to understand the best way to get the letter of invitation that appears to be required, however. I'm applying for an Algerian visa right now as well and they allow for a simple copy of a hotel reservation. My understanding for Uzbekistan is that an actual letter is required and a couple of the hotels I've come across specifically state that they no longer issue these letters. I tried inquiring with a couple of travel agencies in the country but they have not been terribly helpful. Anyone have any guidance/experience with this?
* **Aral Sea tours:** It seems that a guided tour is the only practical way of getting there. I've come across a few that are rather expensive ($800+ for 2-3 days) but I'm currently looking at a couple of cheaper tours offered by Islamek Travel.

I'm flying from Buenos Aires to Paris this summer and I'm worried about which airline/layover combination to choose.

British Airways: EZE - CDG (2 hr layover in London Heathrow)

travel,"I am aware that August is possibly the worst time to visit Spain, because it's hot and everyone is traveling, so some places are closed and others are very busy.  However, we will be in Europe in August, and are seriously considering moving to Spain sooner than originally thought, so I would like to use this opportunity to scout out some places or at least rule any of them out.  We'll be traveling as two adults and a 5 year old. 

Some questions: 

* I am fairly certain that Barcelona and Valencia are fine to visit in August, but what about other regions?  Should we skip Madrid because lots and lots of people leave, or in general?  Should we skip the south because the heat is intense, or is it not that bad?  Barcelona and Valencia are on our list because that's the likely area we'd move to and we'd like to check out the areas and schools, but I am not sure about then moving onto Madrid and Bilbao area, or Seville and Malaga area.  If any of those are good options to settle in as an expat family, that would be super helpful to narrow down the itinerary!
* Should we bother renting a car at all, or is it entirely not necessary?  My spouse will need to run at relatively high altitude through this trip, and I presume mountains are not super public transport friendly, but we could rent a car for the weekend as needed, or rent a car for a longer period if it's very handy to have for moving around.  It does seem to be a lot more expensive in Spain relative to, say, Germany, but maybe I'm not looking in the right places. 
* Our kid's birthday is in the middle of August - what memorable spot should we pick?  Amusement parks, or something else?  We previously planned to go to Europa Park before the plans changed. 
* We will need to get to Chamonix at the end of August.  By this point, we'll probably have accumulated enough stuff to make flying harder - what's the best bet to get there?  We could fly, take a set of trains to Chamonix, or take a train from Barcelona to Geneva (I think) and rent a car there to make it easier to get around the Alps.",Family trip to Spain in August - assuming not the worst idea,,recercar,,1,2023-03-28 20:06:43

travel,"Hey travelers,

I would like to get an advice. Sorry, if it gets a little bit longer.

I want/need to leave my country for a few month, because my wife needs to go to her homecountry and I decided to join. While the cause for the trip is not that pleasent (also not super duper bad) we plan to combine the trip with some fun stuff, visit some neigborhood countries and enjoy life for six month abroad.
It is relative short term and when I told my boss about it, he said directly that he will do everything to keep me at the company and enable me to do the trip anyway. I thanked him but also said that I will quit if we can't find a good compromise.

I should mention that I am lucky to work in a field where I can easily find a new job within days. So ""job security"" is not really an issue for me.

Today, HR offered me a contract that basically says, I can work in my current job, once I return after 6 month. I told the HR lady that I need to consider that and she was surprised that I was not super happy about it. I told her, I do not see many advantages in it. I'm not sure, what I exected.

Personally, I would prefer to be more flexible with my trip (e.g. return date). I also see the whole thing relative objectivly: There is an employee employer relationship and both sides need to agree if  we want to keep it going or not. If yes, great. If not, that's also fine.

So the thing is I was a bit shocked about the HR staffs reaction and asked in a work related subreddit for advice.  Everybody told me, I'm ungrateful and should be happy my employer makes me such an offer to go travelling without losing my job. I should be thankful, because other works do not have equal possibilities. And I wasted other peoples time by not taking the offer that they worked on providing me.  

That hit me harder than I would like to admit. I tend to doupt my decisions and worry a lot. Then I thought, it might also be because I asked in a sub, where work is relative high valued. So, I thought, I see what people who value travel think about the situation.

Maybe I should add, a few years back I quit a job for travelling as well and I met my wife during this trip. So I can say this was for sure the best decision of my life. The trip itself is not the issue. This will be our first months long travel since we met. We traveled here and there for a week or two but did not go on a longer trip for years. 

Would you take the freedom you get by quitting your job for travelling or would you prefer to stay employed but would be more limited concerning your trip?

On March 15, the chinese embassy opened up visa-free travel and I understand that only [negative ART test is required for inbound travellers by flight.](http://sg.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/lsfw/202303/t20230301_11033053.htm). Similarly, I would only need to present a negative ART test result to enter hk from Singapore. However, I‚Äôm unable to find any updated information regarding entry to mainland china from hk by land. This is the only information I‚Äôve found which requires a [PCR test if I have travelled overseas within the last 7 days before entry. ](https://hongkongfp.com/2023/02/03/breaking-covid-pcr-test-requirement-for-cross-border-travel-between-hong-kong-and-mainland-china-scrapped-from-monday/)


I‚Äôm really worried now as I recently just tested positive for covid on Sunday night and I‚Äôm sure that any PCR tests I take will come up with a positive result. I would really appreciate if anyone who has any knowledge on this can share any advice. 


Here is a list of additional questions that I have regarding cross-border travel. Thank you!


1. If only an ART test is required to enter mainland china from hk, can it be self-administered?


2. If a PCR test is required for cross-border entry by land: If I book another flight from hk to mainland china, does this mean only a self-administered art test will be required? 


3. If a PCR test is required: Would appreciate any advice on any other ways to enter mainland china without requiring a PCR test.",[NEED URGENT ADVICE] Cross-border Travel between Hong Kong and Mainland China as a Foreigner,,jujuyuzutea,,2,2023-03-28 17:19:25

1. I am eager to try montreal style bagel, there are few good places but is there a good one to go and maybe see how they make the bagle, St-Viateur Bagel supposed to be the best, is it custom to ask them to slice and toast bagel, in us cream cheese is extra, is it the same there.
2. I searched online and Schwartz is the best sandwich shop- please recommend, I am going to the market a lot, can anyone else recommend different places.
3. is it normal to haggle in the market? I plan on going to Jean-Talon Market, Atwater Market also is it rude to ask for sample things in particular cheese and cold cut meat

7. is seafood popular there? I don't eat much meat ( for health reason) and online search with popular food in montreal usually involved meat/ sweet pastry/stew type of dish.

travel,"I recently got back from a two week vacation in Europe and overall I had a great time! It‚Äôs my first time traveling solo and would definitely do it again sometime soon. I just wanted to share some tips but moreso things I will do differently on my next one. 

1. For a two week trip, pack one week‚Äôs worth of clothing (if possible). If you‚Äôre staying at a metro city, you will find laundromats or if you‚Äôre staying at an Airbnb or something, you can probably have the option to use their washer/dryer. I don‚Äôt pack light since I always need options (cause fashion or whatever). 

2. Get an extra adapter (especially if you‚Äôre from the US traveling to Europe, etc). Mine broke on the first day and had to find one in Venice and the ones I found at first were ‚Ç¨30+ but eventually stumbled upon one at a random store for ‚Ç¨10. 

3. Schedule rest days. Jet lag wasn‚Äôt even the main issue but after week one I was getting sick and tired of going to museums and doing touristy stuff that I just wanted to do absolutely nothing. I wanted to see as many things as I can but I guess I forgot that I‚Äôm no machine.

4. Splurge on premium economy for longer flights if you can. I highly recommend it if you can afford it. I suffered during both of my flights (to and from the US) for 10 hrs and my seats were really uncomfortable even though I‚Äôm a tiny person. I wish I splurged a little for better seats so I can at least get some sleep during the flight. 

5. Bring my own to go box. Maybe this is stupid and weird but I know in some countries they don‚Äôt really have to go boxes like we do in the US, but as a solo traveler I can‚Äôt usually eat all of the food at once and need space for dessert. One bar in Paris eventually gave me a to go box when they saw that I still had a lot of food left when I asked for a check. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed but it was embarrassing lol it would be nice to have my leftovers in my own to go box so I can munch on it later on. I think it‚Äôs a great way to not waste food especially if I can‚Äôt fit it all in my belly.


I‚Äôm not beating myself up for the mistakes I‚Äôve done during my trip, after all, it‚Äôs not going to be my last one!

travel,"Hi, trying to think about a 2 week trip to Albania +/- Macedonia and Kosovo, for 13-14 days in July.

Would start by flying into Podgorica and going straight to Shkoder and spending a day there, doing the Valbone-Theth hike, then Tirana for a couple days. (Total about 6-7 days)

Interests: some history, city life/nightlife, nature, good hostels to meet people, food and drink.

Travelling via bus apart from a probable taxi to Shkoder

Option 1, 7 days

From Tirana head to Ohrid for a day or two, then Skopje, maybe Prizren depending on time and flying out of Pristina late on the last day

Option 2: 8 days

From Tirana head South and see Berat, Gjirokaster and Himare, before going to Sarande to get the ferry to Corfu on the last day for a flight back.

Option 1 allows me to see a couple of new countries, but has no time in Southern Albania and no beach time. Any thoughts on what would be more interesting?

My layover is just for 2 hours in Milan, but the problem is that I will have to retrieve my baggage and recheck it as the airline companies change. I have a valid US visa and I do not want to leave the airport and neither change terminals.

Though, to retrieve luggage, I may have to go through customs/immigration. Therefore, I want to ask if I would be requiring an airport transit visa for this? I have a valid US visa and I am a Pakistani national.

It is mentioned at schengen visa info that a person with a valid US visa is exempt from airport transit visa. How does retrieval of baggage and rechecking works at Milan Malpensa?

The worst case, will I be allowed to travel with just a hand carry? Therefore, I won't have recheck the baggage and I would directly head to the gate of my next flight.

travel,"I currently have the international size Solgaard carry on, and I want to get a similar larger size carry on. My research seems to have led me to these 3 brands. I love the quality and feel of the Solgaard handle and wheels; however, I don‚Äôt get use out of the closet system and it‚Äôs physically smaller than the Away and Monos bags. I tried using my ex-boyfriend‚Äôs regular size Solgaard for a trip once, and ended up not using it because I couldn‚Äôt get everything to fit (my current larger carry on is a rolling duffle style, which is great, but I want one with 360 wheels).

Away has an expandable option, which sounds smart to me, even though not technically within specifications. Little undecided whether this feature is smart or dangerous. However, I read a couple things that suggested the Monos bags wheels and handle feel more durable than Away. But I know Away has done well in some reviews. 

Another difference is clamshell vs latch closure, but I haven‚Äôt settled on my preference there yet. 

In terms of the feel of rolling the suitcase, does anyone know whether the Away suitcase or the Monos suitcase is closer to the feel of Solgaard? I will be putting a very heavy backpack on top of it when i travel. 

I think my top priority is capacity, which knocks Solgaard out of the running, and my second priority is quality/feel, given my indecision on expandable and zipper vs latch. Given that, which would you recommend?

Any other brands I might not be aware of that I should consider?

I'll be going with my girlfriend, we're both in our late 20s. We're both well-travelled and have solo travelled in the past, although unlike me my girlfriend has never been to a developing country, mainly just Europe and some developed Asian countries. She's from Korea so she's not used to seeing poverty, homeless, beggars and she's not really got any street smarts at all. I'm from the UK and I've spent time in some poorer counrries so a little more wise to the world.

If it was just me going I'd have no concerns about my safety but I'm worried about my girlfriend. I'll look out for her as best as I can but can't be on guard all the time and worrying she'll find it hard to turn down grifters or deal with persistent sellers etc. 

Also concerned about stories of sexual harassment towards women. Particularly since she's East Asian and so I think she'll attract a lot of attention from men since I don't think many East Asians go to India. She's quite nervous about it and I want to put her mind at ease.

I‚Äôd also potentially like to scuba dive one of the days while out there since I have my open water scuba certification. I‚Äôd love to see all of the nature and animals while I‚Äôm out there (especially swimming with hammerhead sharks, if possible!)

That being said, I do really love Japanese culture/ cuisine and Japan has always been on my bucket list. I‚Äôd love to go and see the nature side of Japan too (Mt Fuji, Nachi waterfall, etc). I have also heard that I may possibly need at least an advanced open water certification for Galapagos, so would need to get that this year.

I understand that budget is a big consideration here so I‚Äôd say $5k USD would be my budget for the trip (excluding flights). I‚Äôd wager that budget may go farther in Japan compared to Galapagos, but would love people‚Äôs input. 

For those that have been to both, which would you recommend? Thanks!",Japan or Galapagos for 2 weeks?,,allthetunes,,2,2023-03-28 02:07:53

travel,"So I just realized I'm flying from Orlando to London Gatwick, then need to transfer to London Heathrow to Prague on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning, all on British Airways. I fly out of Orlando Tuesday night, get into Gatwick at 10:10 am, then need to somehow get to London Heathrow for my connection to Prague, which departs at 1:20 pm (which means I need to get out of Gatwick, transfer to Heathrow, get through security and make it to my gate in just over 3 hours, assuming absolutely no delays on my first flight).

I'm an absolute idiot, I looked at flights on google flights but specifically avoided these kinds of bookings for this exact reason. But, when I booked using the Chase rewards program, it just said ""London"" as the connection and I didn't put two and two together, so please learn from my mistake.

Anyway, do I have any hope of making this connection? Anybody been in a similar situation that has some advice?

April 15th - 18th - Tunis (Work in the evenings)

18th - 20th - Sidi Bou Said (Work in the evenings)

20th - Douz

21st-23rd Sahara camping tour (Vacation begins)

23rd (may extend to do some other adventure in Sahara like Quad bike)

24th explore star wars hotel and chott el djerid, evening in Tozeur

25th Stay in Tozeur (visit Chebika oasis etc)

26th - One night in Djerba (Rent a car here)

27th - One night in Sfax

28th - Drive to El Jem, spend a day (Night in Monastir/Soussee)

29th and 30th evening in Soussee

1st May - Kairoukuan  (visit Mosque, etc.)

2nd - Stay in Hammamet

3rd - 6th - Any suggestions? Maybe head back to Tunis and explore Cape Angela?

Also, 15-21 is overlapping with Ramadan time. Would finding places to eat and all be a bit difficult? Initially, I was thinking of renting a car from Djerba but it seems like going from Tunis to Douz is not straightforward. Is that the case? Would I need a 4\*4 car or would a normal compact car do?

I tried different days, I never got anyone. I tried again after the first of this year, finally got through and was told no more refunds/credits were going to be given.

My girlfriend and I are spending a few weeks travelling by train around bits of France and Barcelona.

Yes I know, tourists like me are why places feel touristy.

Hopefully that isn't too broad or too much of a ramble, but basically, what would you recommend that isn't common knowledge or just absolutely shouldn't be missed, or are there any events on during any of these periods?

travel,"Hello all!

My partner and I have been itching to do our first trip to Europe this fall, and have finally started to move forward with planning. In our 10 day itinerary, we are most interested in visiting Barcelona, Switzerland, and Munich. 

Just some brief points:

\- We are trying to aim for mid/end of September as we would like to attend Oktoberfest and meet up with one of my partner's German friends he met while in the U.S. 

\- Airfare budget \~$2,000 (US dollars)

\- Would like to spend approximately 3 days in each country. Not set on what other cities besides Munich and Barcelona (would love to catch a Barca match) we would like to visit/lodge in thus far, but very open.

While doing my initial research on flights, I found we would need multi-city flights (Home (New Orleans, LA, USA) --&gt; Barcelona; Barcelona --&gt; Switzerland; Train from Switzerland to Munich; Munich --&gt; Home). Ideally, this can be done in the reverse as well, as we are really trying to work within the time frame of Oktoberfest (Sept 16-Oct 3). However, booking in this order goes a bit over the ideal budget, as there are 3 separate flights and a train from Barcelona to Zurich, Switzerland would be way too long from my understanding. We are willing to X out Barcelona for a city in Italy (likely Milan), therefore we only have 2 separate flights and can take the train from Munich --&gt; Switzerland --&gt; Milan in a decent time frame, while staying within budget. We are absolutely set on Munich and Switzerland, but any other suggestions for a third nearby country would be great.

With that being said, my main questions are:

\- What would be the best way to go about booking multi-city flights and getting the best bang for our buck?

\- Is 10 days ideal for a first Europe trip?

\- Is it worth it to keep Barcelona on the itinerary? If not, what are some other cities you may suggest?

I'm still in the early phase of my research for this trip, but airfare is something we're looking to first book by next month. Any and all advice is welcome, as this is also my first time out of the U.S! Thank you all!",Planning 10 Day Europe Trip...Advice Needed!,,msimone98,,0,2023-03-27 23:59:54

travel,"It seems a common practice up to the 2000s to negotiate with the owner or upper manager for rates even in some chain brands. However these days even stand-alone non chain owned Inns arnt able or willing to negotiate to match online rates despite how they would prefer guests book through them than through the websites that take commission off them and that they still have plenty of rooms open. But their higher rates and reluctance to lower them make guests book-online for a lower rate. it due to contracts they have with these websites? Ie hotels, booking.com

I also noticed that the bargaining culture in Mexico or among Mexican vendors elsewhere seems to be gone as well in the last five years. I guess they learned they cannot cheat customers as much as before as customers have smartphones these days.

travel,"I recently received a $2,000 cash settlement from a car accident that‚Äôs free and clear for me to use as I want. I‚Äôm graduating from college in May and want to take a trip to cross something off my bucket list. I‚Äôm a 22M, pretty well traveled. I‚Äôve narrowed it down to pretty much two options:

1) First-class flight to Hawaii. I found a screaming deal on a Hawaiian flight for $1,000 first class, round trip from the mainland. I‚Äôve always wanted to fly first class at least once in my life. So, I could cross flying first class off my bucket list and get to go to Hawaii in the meantime. However, I‚Äôve already been to Hawaii a few times in my childhood, so it‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúnew‚Äù destination for me. But then again, it‚Äôs Hawaii for crying out loud.

2) Alaskan cruise from Seattle. I‚Äôve never been on a cruise, I‚Äôve always wanted to go on one. Never been to Alaska either. I could fit a nice room on the ship and economy flights onto my $2,000 budget. The cruise itself would be somewhat between $1,000-1,500 depending on the dates. I‚Äôm a solo traveler, so it costs more than the $300-400 per person advertised fares out there.

Unfortunately, first class tickets into Seattle from my home city would cause me to exceed my budget by a large margin.

Any suggestions or any other ‚Äúunique‚Äù travel opportunities for a solo traveler which may fit in my budget?

travel,"Hey! My boyfriend and I are headed to Costa Rica for 10 days, leaving on May 28. The main goal of the trip is surfing, we both shortboard and he has more experience than me, however, I definitely can hold my own in the lineup and in more powerful breaks. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for beaches for intermediate surfers? We're trying to stay away from rocky breaks or anything at river mouths so we can have some chill surf days, but we're also looking to get barreled a couple of times; we're flexible with our location and skill. During the whole trip, we are doing hostels and using a rental car across the country so I'm trying to aim for secluded beaches that aren't touristy. We are flying into San Jose and plan to go to Jaco for the first night to rest up after our red-eye flight, however, everything else is up in the air. I see all the beaches that are listed on travel websites, however, I know that's not the best way to truly see a country. 

Other than surfing we also want a true rainforest experience away from the craziness of tourists as well as check out great beaches for snorkeling and swimming. We're not looking to stay in resorts and have a luxury experience, just be very much be in nature and the environment. Please let me know if you have any recommendations for our trip at all!

I'm currently a teacher but I have decided that teaching is no longer for me. I haven't travelles much as a teacher because even though I have the summer off, a) I don't make a lot of money so I usually worked a second job in the summer and b) I didn't want to travel to certain places in the summer because it would be too hot or too busy. 

I'd like to find a job where I can work a bunch over a shorter period of time (like a month or two) and make a good amount of money and then have a month off and then repeat. 

In an ideal world, I would be a freelance writer, but I think it's pretty unrealistic for me to be able to make enough money to travel, at least for awhile. 

I don't want to work this way forever but I'm 34 and still single &amp; childless so I figured I might as well travel as much as I can now. I'd like to have kids and the clock is ticking so if I meet the right person I wouldn't want to wait very long to have kids with them.

I have a Bachelor of Arts in English and a Bachelor of Education. I'd rather not have to go back to school if I don't have to since I don't necessarily want this to be a forever thing but I would consider it.

My dad is a pilot and his schedule was a month on/a month off for years, which would be fine while I don't have kids but when I did have kids it would suck. 

Any ideas??? Does such a job exist?? I'm not sure what sort of fields support freelance work.

travel,"Hello fellow redditors,

I'm planning a trip in late September from the UK to the US because my partner and I want to visit some National Parks and the Grand Canyon. We don't really care about the cities themselves as we're more interested in landscapes.

The itinerary would more or less be:

 Day 1: San Francisco
 Day 2: Drive to Yosemite
 Day 3: Yosemite
 Day 4: Drive to King's Canyon
 Day 5: Sequoia Park
 Day 6: Death Valley
 Day 7: Drive to Grand Canyon
 Day 8: Grand Canyon
 Day 9: Las Vegas (Red Rock Canyon)
 Day 10: Go back to sunny UK
 

I know it's a lot of driving but we're used to very busy holidays and we enjoy it. I'm wondering if it would be wise to remove Kings Canyon for example and put that extra day somewhere else. We could also expand the trip to make it 14 days but I'm afraid budget-wise it would get too demanding.

travel,"I received an email today detailing the changes. **TLDR, they downgrade the reward program discount from 10% to 2%.**

Previously you got a stamp with 10% of the value of the night for each night, and when you had 10 stamps you could use the average value of the 10 stamps for a new booking, effectively a 10% discount. 

Now you just earn 2% right away without having to save 10 stamps.

https://www.hotels.com/one-key

While I'm slightly pissed about this and think it will be slightly counterproductive (as the 10% discount was enough to keep me on Hotels.com, the poor 2% discount means I'll now just go wherever is cheapest), at least it seems like the transition to the new system will be fair, and you'll get your full stamps value in ""OneKeyCash"".

travel," 

Hi everyone,

I'm new to travelling and I have a question about my upcoming flights. I'm flying from New Delhi to Prince George in Canada with a layover in Frankfurt and Vancouver. My flight from New Delhi to Frankfurt lands at 8:30am, and my connecting flight from Vancouver to Prince George departs at 5:40pm. I booked the flights separately, with Lufthansa for the first leg and WestJet for the second leg.

My main concern is whether the layover time in Vancouver is enough for the domestic flight to Prince George. I've never travelled to Canada before and I'm not sure what to expect. Will I need to collect my baggage and go through customs again in Vancouver, or will it be checked through to Prince George? And how long does it usually take to go through customs and security for a domestic flight?

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",Layover time in Vancouver: Is it enough for a domestic flight to Prince George?,,JayeshSethi,,1,2023-03-27 14:19:11

Tel-Aviv was one of the considerations for places to go so we could see the Bauhau Architecture and go to a coffee shop. So in a sense a "" chill day"" and we were probably going to go via the train then take a taxi to the area we wanted to go to. 

Other considerations were rent a car and go to Baha'i Gardens and Akka for the day from Jerusulam.

travel,"I have a couple of big milestones coming up (40th bday this Spring and 15th sobriety birthday next Summer). My husband &amp; I are going to take celebration trips for both, but I am overwhelmed looking at options and am seeking input here. We travel domestically quite a bit,  always with our kids. We have also travelled a decent amount without our kids in the Caribbean (eastern side of Mexico, Bahamas, DR, Jamaica, Cayman Islands), but we are worried about the amount of sargassum headed that way this summer and so are looking at other possibilities. I have been to France and England, he has been to Greece, Turkey, and Northern Italy. We are wanting to use at least one of these trips to go to a new place together than neither of us has previously been to. Since we have travelled almost exclusively in the Caribbean, I have no ideas what else is out there that might work for us! Some info below about each trip to hopefully help in gaining suggestions from you all:

40th bday trip:
- would be this summer, likely in mid to late June
- kid free trip! I want to relax and read a book without interruptions every five minutes
- max of 8 days so not looking at anything that that takes 12+ hours to get there from Indy/Chicago area or requires more than one connection 
- we are warm weather people, so not interested in any cold weather locales 
- I am a beach person. My husband will tolerate beaches as long as there is a decent amount of activities. He also enjoys local beers and foods. I am not an adventurous eater so would need ‚ÄúAmericanized‚Äù options
- budget for this trip is $6k max for hotel/flight/food. Can go above that for anything extra. 

15th sobriety bday trip:
- max of 12-14 days
- could go anytime from Memorial Day to Labor Day next summer 
- could either take kids (would be 3 and 8 at the time), or could do another solo trip
- my dream vacation is Maldives, my husbands dream vacation is a tour of all MLB stadiums. I like quiet, he likes to stay busy. So would need some combo of both. 
- no specific budget, within reason

travel,"This is just a rant. Just traveled on a DOH- USA flight in business class with Qsuites. I booked the ticket using a partner awards program and I was really excited with all the hype around qatar airways on social media. Although I am really appreciative of the roomy cubicle and the great bedding in Qsuites, I didn‚Äôt find the whole experience living up to the hype of being the world‚Äôs best business  class mostly due to the service. The service was more comparable to US airlines than Asian airlines. For one there wasn‚Äôt any personalized service that usually comes with traveling in premium cabins such as being addressed by name or remembering your meal preference. I had to remind them of my meal preferences during the meal service and the crew seemed to be in a hurry to finish up the meal service. The bread that they served in both meals was either too hard to eat or crumbled just on breaking it.  Food presentation wasn‚Äôt that great either (they did have a fake lamp though that added a nice touch).  The seats looked old and worn. Restrooms weren‚Äôt constantly  cleaned during the flight. The onboard movie collection wasn‚Äôt too extensive. I wonder if covid had to do something with the state that Qatar airways is in now.  Of course it‚Äôs totally possible that it was a one off thing and maybe I didn‚Äôt get their best. I have seen far better service and food in Japan airlines although their hard product are not the most popular.

\- street vendors constantly trying to speak/say something in Italian to you, whilst switching back to MSA as soon as you say no or ignore them

travel,"Hi guys, I will be visiting Singapore for a short vacation from April 5th till 9th. Fully aware that most of days in the range will be either a public holiday or religious event (Qingming Festival on 5th, Good Friday on 7th, and Holy Saturday on 8th). 

So I made an itinerary already, planning to visit a few famous hawkers, bars, and restaurants, and a few tourist spots too (Bugis, Chinatown, Orchard, Marina Bay mostly). Will most restaurants and tourist spots be closed on these holidays? For example, I plan to explore Chinatown and some hawkers in the area on the 5th, but my common sense tells me that most of the food stalls will be closed since people will go praying? Is this usually the case? Should I move it to the 6th let's say?

And also, would you guys recommend reserving spots at restaurants or rooftop bars in advance since it will be more crowded? Another question would be what will the weather be during this time? I know that it rains quite often all year long over there, but hoping for more sun when I visit lol.

Appreciate any comments or suggestions since my last time visiting was quite a while ago, thanks!","Visiting Singapore from April 5th-9th, need advice on itinerary",,askyfullofstar23423,,1,2023-03-27 08:23:05

1. Either I wait until I graduate and go on an enormous trip by myself duirng the summer (Also, I will have much more money saved up)

travel,"Hi r/travel! My wife and I are a few months into a tour of South America, and we've really wanted to visit Peru. We've been holding off due to other factors drawing us towards other countries, but now things are lining up to head to Lima, then Cusco. Visiting Machu Picchu would be a dream! From what I've been reading, the protests have died down in most of the country, and transportation around Cusco and MP has mostly normalized. We plan on spending 2-4 weeks in Cusco and wanted to see if anyone is in the area and can say how it's looking. Are things generally open and running on schedule? Any recommendations for parts of the city to stay and do some quiet studying and tourism from? Thank you for any info!","Weekly ""How is Peru?"" Post",,afminick,,1,2023-03-27 00:03:26

travel,"I'm looking for a new hard shell carry on luggage that would work for international flights and I'm between the Beis and Monos. My biggest concern between the two is the size. 

The Beis 21-inch Carry-On luggage external size on their site states that it is:  W 40cm H 58cm D 25cm / W 15.78in H 22.8in D 9.8in

The Monos states spec size on their site states that it is:  H22"" √ó W14"" √ó D9"" / H55.9cm x W35.6cm x D22.8cm

It's my understanding that the general recognized industry standard for carry on luggage is 22"" √ó 14"" √ó 9"" (in line with the Monos).

However, I do fly Air Canada very often and their sizing is much different being: H21.5in x W15.5in xD9in / H55cm x W40cm x D23cm. 

I've rarely seen Air Canada care about the 0.5 inch difference in height but they do care about the other measurements. 

So I would go with the Monos but since Air Canada does give a more room for the width, I do wish the Monos was slightly bigger (given that I am an over-packer).

What would you recommend? I am also interested to hear if there's any other brands that have the same sleek style &amp; quality in the same or lower price point. The convenience of both the Monos and Beis brands is what lurs me to them, compared to your standard luggage brans.

For context, I'm doing this simply because my it feels like my biological family hates me. They constantly call me dramatic, and as I have gotten older it seems like more and more people seem to drop away or want no contact. Alot of it is with out differences in religion. I live in the midwest, right in the dead heart of the Bible belt, and all want to genuinely not talk to me because I won't forgive my parents for sexually assaulting me as a child and went through severe abuse. That being said I testified against my dad and he went to jail, and my mom was never fully held accountable. (their mindset is- regardless of the offense if God forgave you have to forgive.) And I'm just not there, nor do I think I ever will be.

I'm actively in therapy and I'm taking meds, basically just trying to move forward in life, but I feel like I am haunted by where I live with all these memories so I need out.

travel,"Hello.

Me and a few of my friends from Sweden are planning a 2 week trip to Vietnam in Jan/Feb where we are considering renting mopeds (or something along those lines). I have some general thoughts and questions about this. We are all male in our early 20s, we all have traveling experience, but most of our previous trips have been with family and with very simple accommodation (hotel or renting villas), mostly in Europe too.

We want to rent mopeds and kind of experience Vietnam on the fly, obviously planning stops and such beforehand (not booking hotel/homestay rooms thought). Is it maybe better to actually book the places where we should sleep beforehand?

The thought we have in mind is to travel from Da Nang all the way down to Ho Chi-Minh City, but is it even possible to do this with mopeds?

 Is it maybe better to rent cars just incase? By doing in on mopeds we'd probably get to remote places a little easier.

Would it even be possible to rent a vehicle/mopeds in Da Nang and bring them to Ho Chi-Minh City (or nearby)? 

We'd stop and sleep every night in new places, is that something we can rely on, that we'll always have a place to sleep?

We'll drive mostly on the coastal roads, avoiding big city centers because of the traffic, and hopefully leave the mopeds a bit from Ho Chi-Minh City and maybe take a taxi in when we are to leave?

Another thought we've had is if it's better to go by train or bus to different towns/cities, but would it still be possible to sightsee the same amount?

There are probably a bunch of things I've yet thought about, I'd appreciate any info and advice I can get. Is it better to maybe do this in a different country instead? (preferably Asia)

Should I just buy day passes for when I am in Madrid and the return train/bus for the other cities, or is there a better option than that?

It's an exchange program, and some students stay for multiple semesters if they decide they like the program, which I may do.

I was told over the phone that Korean Air does allow this, for a fee, but I'm a little bit worried that it may have time or cost restrictions that are too far out of my budget, however the lady didn't seem to have much information I could understand. 

I have seen that it seems to depend from airline to airline, and usually a fee is involved, maybe around 100-300 USD depending on time of year etc, which is fine.

travel,"Hi! Me and my husband are thinking of having kids in a few years, so we are really trying to prioritise travelling before then. We are based in the UK, so while generally Europe is cheap and accessible to us, where we live we don't have particularly great airports nearby.

Vienna and Budapest have been on our list of places to want to visit for a while but they are a bit of a pain to get to from our local airport. Ideally we would fly into one and out of another but that's proving tricky. It would require travelling to an airport about 5-6 hours away and the way the flight times work out, that would involve probably taking at least one extra day annual leave from work to factor in that travel. We are trying to maximise the amount of travel we can do with our annual leave allowance, so ideally don't want to waste a day or two on travelling to an airport.

Bratislava is a destination that's super cheap to fly out of our local airport and as it's located kinda between these Vienna and Budapest, I'm thinking of a trip that would look something like this:

Day 1:
Arrive in Bratislava around 10am, train or bus to Budapest.

Day 2-3:
Budapest

Day 4: 
Train or bus to Vienna from Budapest. 

Day 5-7:
Vienna

Day 7:
Early bus/train to Bratislava, spend the day there 

Day 8:
Flight home from Bratislava at 7am

This trip would be early September. Does this seem doable or is it too much travelling between places?

travel,"I was recently lucky enough to listen to Robert Reynolds share his story.  Re-creating scenes and landscapes wasn't only a profession, but it was something at the very centre of his identity.¬† So you can only imagine the sense of turmoil and disruption which ensued when Robert suffered a rare form of stroke that would leave him totally blind in his left eye and subsequently rob him of the ability to paint.

Robert's approach to life since this life changing event is that he wants to spend the rest of his life maximising on vision and to do this, he has chosen to bicycle tour.

Bicycle Touring was something Robert has enjoyed doing for many decades - even prior to his life changing stroke.¬† But since this event, he has been inspired to spend the best part of 6 - 8 months of each year exploring the world on his two wheels.¬† In his own words - he needed to do something harder than being blind whilst seeing as much as possible.  He is now more comfortable out enjoying the outdoors and sleeping in his tent. 

Robert has toured extensively throughout the world, including North and South America, South East Asia, Europe and Africa.¬† I personally found inspiration listening to him recount his experiences from his cycle tours and interactions with people in different countries and cultures. 

The images below are a small collection from Robert of his cycle tours and also a couple of his art sketches.  You can hear him share his story on the Seek Travel Ride podcast.  It really gave me a sense of wanderlust and the idea of 'maximising my vision' and seeing the world at a slower pace really resonates.

travel,"Travelling is my passion and I've been fortunate to visit every continent except Europe. Next year, I'm planning to take a 3 months off with my S.O. to finally do Europe but I feel like I'm starting to seriously question the way I travel. Let me explain why. 

My travel itineraries have always been very well planned. Say I wanted to go to Tokyo. 
* First I'll search on Reddit, TripAdvisor, YouTube and Google Reviews to identify the best things to do. These would include major attractions (e.g. Shibuya Crossing) but also hidden gems (e.g. a hiking day trip to Kamakura).
* Then I'll research a good value accommodation to stay at that allows me easy access to all these places. 
* Next I'll research the best restaurants to eat at near the things I want to do. I usually watch food vloggers or search local review sites for recommendations since Google/TripAdvisor reviews are always skewed towards tourists and I prefer places that are popular with the locals. 
* Finally I'll use all of this to plan a meticulous itinerary that allows me to get to everywhere I need to be, account for travel time (with buffer) and reduce any inefficiencies from needing to backtrack. Typically I only have 1-2 things I definitely want to tick off for the day so it's definitely not jam packed like a lot of packaged tours are. 

The benefit of this approach is that I'm able to craft a very efficient itinerary that allows me to tick off the best things to do/eat in an area while optimized for the time I have. I also save money because I'll be booking bang-for-buck accommodation (which usually sells out early) and I reduce backtracking. I also reduce the amount of planning I need to when I'm travelling so I can enjoy things in the moment. 

The unfortunate downside is that I rarely get to discover things on my own. While I'm not on a tight schedule, there's still a timeline to follow so I never get the chance to just do something completely random. I do have portions of my itinerary that allow for discovery (e.g. spend the afternoon exploring a particular district with no other plans for the day) but I rarely discover anything new. I'm also starting to find that that after doing so much planning, I never feel completely satisfied when I finally see that museum I read so much about or go to that beach with a 4.8 star Google rating with 10k+ reviews. Maybe because I already know what to expect so it takes the fun out of discovering something for the first time. This is why I've recently stopped reading too much about a particular attraction other than knowing it has good reviews, but then I lose the context and why I should be seeing it in the first place so I appreciate it less. While I feel like I can over plan sometimes, I also don't completely regret doing my research either because there have been some really good restaurants, hotels and hidden gems that I would not have known about if I didn't discover them before the trip.

I guess I'm now at a point where I want to experience the joys of discovering things for myself but also want to make sure I don't miss out on the really good experiences due to not planning enough. 

Back to my future Europe trip, the old me would've come up with an itinerary that has me going through a new country every 1-2 weeks. Maybe something like [this](https://www.eurail.com/en/get-inspired/suggested-itineraries/european-highlights-itinerary). Every country will have it's own itinerary based on our interests with accommodation and transport booked well in advance to save on costs. But I'm wondering if I should plan less and just work it out when I'm there. Is it possible to do this in Europe? I'm thinking of going from March to June so it will be before it gets too busy. How could I go about this new way of travel? I have so many questions like:
* How far in advance will I need to plan? Say I was I started in Rome, how do I know how long to book my accommodation? If I wanted to go to Florence next, when should I book my accommodation and how would I know how long I need to book for? 
* If I don't plan anything beforehand, how would I know where to go next? My S.O. and I won't be meeting new people much so we'll probably be looking things up online. Given we're going to be getting ideas online anyways, isn't it more efficient to do it before we go travelling so we can focus our holiday on enjoying the country we're in rather than planning? 
* One idea I heard was to book accommodation but ensure they have free cancellation. That way you can be flexible and change your trip itinerary when you learn about new things. I feel like if I did this, I might end up sticking to the accommodation I had pre-booked because there was a reason I wanted to go to those places in the first place. How can I learn about new things to do that I won't necessarily know about from doing research on Reddit, Google or TripAdvisor?

Keen to hear if others have had similar experiences on trying to not over plan and how you've dealt with this. And for those that have always travelled with minimal plans, how you manage to be comfortable with knowing you might not see everything and saving on costs.",Mid life travel crisis: how to balance planning with discovery?,,acinod,,0,2023-03-26 03:12:25

I am very unfortunately sick on my 9 day trip to spain. it hit me day 3. i am wondering if anyone can give me a good idea of what kind of treatment option i can get here. i went to the farmacia and they gave me cough drops and some thing to bring neck lymph node swelling down but i think i could use more. i wasn‚Äôt able to fully explain my illness in spanish. j think it is a viral infection. i have a terrible sore throat (first thing to come) and then later a very runny nose, and now a constant clearing of the throat and occasional cough and a VERY red eye that came this lovely morning‚Ä¶ what can i ask for at the farmacia to help? should i go to the doctor? i am just worried about the price because i do not have travel insurance (yes i know i made a mistake) and no it is not covid i got tested. I am staying inside to prevent the spread

Thank you for the advice the other day about using Google Flights to figure out stopovers. I've been checking out the multi-city tool. 

I now have a question about what this means and how it is different than the multi-city setting. It is giving me results that are, for example, from Tel Aviv to Cairo OR from Tel Aviv to Paphos, but not results that are from Tel Aviv to Cairo and Paphos.

travel,"Hey all,

I'm beginning to plan my vacation this year and have decided on a European solo trip. I'm leaning towards UK (splitting time between the various countries if the time allotment makes sense) or Germany just because I know about the rich history each offers, but am more than willing to hear about alternatives. 

I guess as an American I'm partial to those two because we learn and see so much about them right from childhood, but I of course know other European countries probably have amazing history that I'm just unaware of, so I'm willing to be convinced!

General details:

- 31 year old American male
- I want to spend about 2 weeks on the ground, but will give myself about 16 or 17 days total to account for travel time
- In any new area, my top interests are:
    - history (monuments, castles, religious shrines, museums, etc)
    - food
    - sightseeing (outdoor experiences)
    - ""excursions"" when available (catamaran ride to a waterfall or ATV riding type experiences)
    - I don't care much about beaches or water activities, but I'll hit them if available
- I want to feel safe and be able to explore and walk around freely - not being confined to a resort
- Money isn't a great concern, but if one place is currently 2x more expensive than other places due to currently global financial conditions, I'd take that under consideration

Two friends and I spent 2 weeks in Thailand last year, split between Bangkok and Chiang Mai and it was AMAZING. Was my first true international trip (had a previous vacation to Jamaica, but 80% of it was at the resort, and the other 20% was guided excursions and tours). In Thailand we felt safe enough to just explore freely, walk and travel wherever we wanted, eat at local food spots where we couldn't even understand the menu, etc. I thought the culture shock would've hit me but it didn't at all. Best of all, we went during ""monsoon"" season so the tourist levels were massively down. Almost felt like having the cities to yourself (and it barely even rained anyway).

This makes me think I want that same ""totally different culture"" type trip this year, which would be an argument against a place like UK. But I don't want to get stuck in one type of travel experience, and I've always wanted to visit the UK anyway, so not ruling them out.

travel,"Hi all,

Right to the details.

Who: married couple with a 2.5 year old + 3 month old (will be at time of travel)

When: Early Sept to early Oct (can shorten or lengthen based on cost)

What: Road trip vs flight vs train. Either drive to the location with frequent stops. Or fly there, and then when there use public transit/trains to go between locations. Car easier to lug stuff, but parking in any big city sucks. 

Where: This is the big question mark. We've debated getting a place in Chicago (we're outside the city) but we are there all the time. Summer time Chicago is amazing though. Or an east coast trip [Boston, NYC, Philly]. We've even debated Paris for 3 weeks, but have apprehension about international travel with an infant for health risks. Anywhere is open I guess, if it fits:

Budget: All in I'd like to spend less than 8k. (Includes flight, rental car if needed, airbnb, logistics - not food/drink/experience)

Wants: Central location- would love to walk to coffee, park (walking trail + a few kids playgrounds), great restaurants. Public transit decent system. (Bonus if there's a rooftop I can chill on, gym attached/near by, or a beach near by)

Give me some suggestions. As a note, we've traveled to 25+ countries, and 6 with our toddler. I'm not sure being in one location for 3-4 weeks would be that exciting (outside of somewhere like Paris where we could day trip all over), so probably best to have a few different places/locations.",Travel 3 to 4 weeks (with toddler + infant) help,,RevolutionaryCoyote8,,0,2023-03-25 19:23:08

We don't use any baby carriage, only a baby carrier, a Marsupial (don't exactly know the English term) and we like:
- nature (hiking, etc);
- beach;
- cities with a good cultural identity (typical foods, vibrant life, etc), which somehow excludes those tourists resorts or cities that have mass tourism). So basically, we like the 'off beaten tracks'. 

We're from Portugal and locations 'close' to us that check these boxes are basically Mediterranean destinations:
- Greece. Con: travelling from islands to islands can be very tiring for a baby 
- Balcans (Croatia, Slovenia, Albania, etc)
- Sardinia. Con: a bit expensive
- Sicily. Con: Big island with the main attractions being far from each other
- Cyprus
- Malta 

And many more that are good candidates for us.
From all of these that I mentioned, Malta is increasingly gaining our attention. Is small, beautiful beaches and nature, historical cities, the north is countryside and relatively cheap.

travel,"Hi all. Me and three of my friends are planning a 10 day trip to Europe in mid May and bought plane tickets with no ideas of what to do. We land in Geneva, Switzerland, and leave from the same place 10 days later. We want to pack the most we can into those 10 days. As broke college students, money is tight, but if something is worth the money, we‚Äôll do it.

As of now we have the basic idea of staying in Geneva for one day, then traveling by train to Paris, staying for a couple days, then traveling to Germany. From there we would head back down to Geneva and be on our way. 

Is this plan too ambitious with our allotted time? Is there anything we absolutely shouldn‚Äôt miss? This is a very basic plan and could absolutely be completely changed.

As for what we enjoy, nature and city exploring are equally valuable.

We are going on a trip together in July for a week and another in October penciled in, but we are struggling with me planning vacations that she cannot join.  Specifically, I want to book an 11 day trip to New Zealand wrapped into Labor Day holiday, but she's upset because she already has 4 days allotted off then and wanted to do a shorter trip closer to home.  She also feels like we won't go back to New Zealand together as it feels like a ""once in a lifetime destination.""  

We both want to try to have kids in 2ish years, so I feel the window is closing on taking a 25 hr flight/travel day while I am healthy enough to do hiking/backpacking there. Granted this is also a dream of hers (we have similar interests).

travel,"Posting this here for anyone who, like me, has struggled to find any up to date information about crossing the Wagah border overland, or about the Pakistan e-visa application process, which becomes  particularly complicated if you're attempting it from India.

Various people in India had warned me this wasn't a good idea, maybe because India might not let us back into the country with Pakistan stamps in our passports (if this was true, it would rather invalidate the idea of Wagah being open to tourists at all..) but TL;DR it all worked out smoothly. No problems at the border whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pakistan visa process**

* We (my partner and I) are UK citizens, we already had 1-year multiple entry visas for India, and applied for Pakistan visas while we were already in India. We applied through the Pakistan e-visa service [here](https://visa.nadra.gov.pk/e-visa). 
* First issue is that the Pak website is blocked in India (not sure whether by Indian gvmt or by Pak). Can get around this with a standard VPN. However when it gets to the payment stage, it detected my VPN (ExpressVPN) so I had to give my login details to a friend in the UK, and get him to log on and make the payment for me.
* Conflicting information on the website as to what you need as supporting documents - one page says hotel booking only, one says letter of invitation. I made a cancellable hotel booking in Lahore and submitted the PDF of the booking. I didn't submit a letter of invitation and was never asked for one. 
* Once we'd applied and made the payment, we got a response the next day asking for further documentation - an itinerary, and a list of ""accompanying members"" with passport copies. For the itinerary I wrote a word document with a vaguely sensible 1-week itinerary (which we did not follow at all in the end), with hotel details, but without having made any further bookings, and submitted this as a PDF. For the accompanying members I just added a document with both our names and passport copies together. This all seemed to be sufficient. 
* We didn't receive a response from this point for 3 weeks (not the 7-10 working days it claims on the website) despite repeated emails / attempted phone calls (no answer). At this 3 week point I received an email from the London embassy asking if my partner and I could attend an interview in London 4 days later. We were in India at this point so obviously this wasn't possible - I emailed them to this effect, and they forwarded that back to the main Visa company, cc-ing me in. 5 days later, we received emails telling us the applications were approved, and we could go on the website to download the Visa Grant Notice we needed to clear the border.
* So in total it was 27 days from application through to approval. I was given a 30 day visa, with entry at any point over the next 3 months. My partner was given a 45 day visa for unknown reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Clearing Wagah border**

* This was really no hassle at all, in either direction. From Amritsar there's a cheap bus to Attari from where you can get a rickshaw for 10 mins to the border proper. The biggest difficulty was finding the right place to go at this point, because everyone points you towards the tourist bit of the border where you go to watch the closing ceremony. Just make sure you say ""Pakistan"" to anyone trying to point you the right way.
* Then it's just a matter of about 5 different officials filling in the same details from your passport, and some luggage checks. There's a woman who tries to get you to take a polio vaccine too, but we just insisted that we had had them already (we had) but didn't have any proof (same thing on the way back).
* Some waiting for a bus to go across to the actual border line at this point, where enjoyably you get to cross through the main gate where they do the ceremony, past all the guards in their regalia (we actually backtracked after clearing Pak customs to watch the closing ceremony). 
* Then Pak customs was no issue, just a stamp on the visa grant notice and in the passport. Minimal questioning about what we were doing or why. 
* From the Pak border to Lahore - you have to walk a bit of a distance until you can find any rickshaws or taxis. We took one rickshaw to Wagah town and then got a taxi to take us into Lahore. Was inexpensive.
* In the other direction, we got dropped off right by the customs office on the Pak side, had to queue for a while to get stamped out, then again for the bus on the Indian side, but otherwise was quick and painless. We cleared it in 2 hours (about the same as the other way).

&amp;#x200B;

**Experience in Pakistan**

Almost entirely easy and pain-free - beautiful country, incredibly welcoming people. As I mentioned we didn't stick to our ""itinerary"" at all, or to the original hotel booking, which caused no issues at all. We actually ended up spending 3 weeks total, seeing Lahore, Islamabad, Taxila, Peshawar (just a day trip due to potential security issues) and driving up to Hunza, Nagar, KKH up to Sost, Skardu, then flying back to Islamabad. Seems like a pretty safe time to go to Pakistan (FCO advice agrees), though obviously things can change.",India to Pakistan overland and back via Wagah border - trip report March 2023,,crassius,,1,2023-03-25 05:05:10

I could really use some help dealing with Viking River Cruises. I am trying to get a $3400 fee waived on a ‚Äòsingle supplement charge‚Äô because my 81yo mother isn‚Äôt able to join me on our cruise we originally booked and paid for in 2019. We were supposed to sail in Spring 2020, but covid took care of that. We didn‚Äôt request a refund but opted to rebook. Another wave of covid and we rebooked again. And again. Each time a sailing was cancelled, they issued us a voucher. It is finally time to go, but my mom just informed me she wasn‚Äôt going to take the trip because of her health. When I notified Viking that my mom would not be sailing with me, their response was ‚ÄúIf you chose to cancel your mother from the booking, the single supplement charge will be equal to your mother's cruise fare that was paid on the booking. Since this was paid in a voucher form, this will not be kept applied to the booking and will then need to be paid over and above the voucher that you have applied to the booking‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt *originally* pay in voucher form.

The two hotels are Hotel Duquesne and Hotel Brighton. Duquesne is in the 7th arrondissement which is already pretty close to the tower. Brighton is located in the 1st arrondissement and close to the Louvre and Tuileries. One of my thoughts is if Duquesne is too far away from everything else.

I'm from Portugal, and I will soon start to make regular trips all over Europe and beyond. Countries with all kind of different currency.

Background:
I purchased a flight for my mom (she‚Äôs 73). After emailing/sending her all of the flight information, she tried logging into the airline‚Äôs site to print off stuff. 
Except apparently it was NOT the airline, but some fraudster site. When she kept having trouble getting the detail or her flight, she called the fake site‚Äôs customer service number. They proceeded to tell her that there was a balance due. And of course my mom paid it! She‚Äôs not the sharpest tool in the shed üò≥
She then proceeds to inform me (via text) that the full amount of the ticket wasn‚Äôt paid, but it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. ü§¨
At this point Im thinking something fishy is going on &amp; called her. She told me the United agent was very pushy and said that there was a balance due, and she just paid it. I was baffled, because airlines will NOT issue a confirmation number without full payment (at least I‚Äôve never experienced this in my life!).
I called United to confirm the details of her itinerary, and as I suspected, the flight was paid in full, with my card &amp; there was no balance due, nor was there any indication another transaction had been made. 
I immediately called my mom back and told her to report this to her credit card company as fraud, which she did and was refunded the fraudulent amount taken from her.
Fast forward to today and now she‚Äôs getting threatening texts from that fraud company threatening to cancel her reservation unless she pays up. WTF do I do?

1. Is it rude to put your feet on your seat? I'm taking a trip somewhere and it'll be the first time I've been on a flight longer than 3 hours. For my previous flights, I just kept my feet on the ground because it wasn't uncomfortable or anything, but I'm someone who never sits normally. I always have one or both legs up because it's more comfortable for me. Sitting normally makes me legs feel weird and I don't think that'll just go away on my upcoming flights. Now, when I say ""put my feet up"", I don't mean take of my shoes or stick them on the arms of the seat in front of me, I just mean sitting with my legs crossed, hugging my legs to my chest, etc. I never see people do it so I don't know if it's some unwritten rule that you're not supposed to do it or if it's just not that common for people to sit weird.

2. Is it annoying when the person in the window seat leaves the window shade up the whole flight? My favorite part about flying is being able to listen to music, stare out the window, and just think about things, so when I'm in a window seat I usually keep the window shade up (unless the sun is blinding me).

travel,"Just want to share my experience in getting compensation for my parents' flight with Condor due to a 30hr delay.

BACKGROUND

In August, my parents had a flight from ATL to FRA. Unfortunately, the flight from NYC to FRA was delayed. They kept delaying it by 5 to 7 hours which ended up being 30 hours.

There was no one at the help or check-in desk until the time of their flight which made it impossible to talk to someone in-person to try to change flights or obtain their check-in. The call center was of no help.

I want to emphasize that the call center was not helpful at all. My parents were due to depart at 9 pm but I was still receiving text messages from my mom at 11 pm. I was due to meet my parents at the airport and did not know when they ended up leaving, and had no other flight information. It was not on their Condor account, nor did we receive an email (actually they stopped sending emails after the 1st delay). I called the call center and they kept telling me that my parents' flight wasn't delayed and they should have already arrived the day of the flight.

They arrived and the luggage was lost. When we finally received their luggage, one was broken.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPENSATION

They were told to file for the compensation online.Unlike other airlines, it was a bit difficult to find.You have to file a complaint and under that you have the option to request for compensation for a delay or make a general complaint.

I have attached the link for easy access

[https://www.condor.com/us/help-contact/contact/customer-relations.jsp](https://www.condor.com/us/help-contact/contact/customer-relations.jsp)

Timeline as follows:

Aug 11: Original flight (afternoon)Aug 12: Flight to FRA (Late night)Aug 13: ArrivalAug 14: Compensation form sentAug 15: Received a response approving compensationAug 19: Received an email from a Customer Service Representative (CSR) stating that banking was incorrect so they will send a check and to expect it in 4 weeksSept 27: Emailed the CSR stating that I never received the check. I also filed another compensation request.

At one point, I called the help center and again, they were not helpful. One representative stated that the flight was not delayed so I cannot receive compensation. She did not listen when I stated that I already received an email approving it. She repeated the above and/or said that it must have been a mistake.

Another representative said that they could not find any information of my parents' account or flight information.

3rd representative stated this wasn't part of their department and transferred me to billing. The finance/billing department found my parents' account but said the check was cashed. When I share that we did not do so, they said we need to investigate and see if anyone had stolen our mail and the police would deal with it. Otherwise, it was out of their hands.

I went through my parents' security cameras from Aug 19 to Oct 25. I didn't see anyone taking anything from our mail so I wondered if a USPS driver had taken it.

Oct 26: Emailed CSR again, filed another compensation request and filed a general complaint with the screenshots of all the previous emails. Also, contacted USPS.

Nov 20: Sent another email, filed another compensation request, and filed a complaint for the damaged luggage.

Dec 23: Sent another email, filed another compensation request, and filed a complaint for the damaged luggage.

Jan 9: The same CSR responded to the damaged luggage complaint requesting more information. I responded requesting to address the compensation issue first.

Jan 10: The same CSR confirmed the check was not cashed and to re-send my account information so they can process the transfer. I responded and no response.

Jan 13: Emailed the previous 2 emails where the CSR emailed me. Filed another compensation request

Feb 3: Emailed the previous 2 emails where the CSR emailed me. Filed another compensation request

Feb 10 to 21: I sent emails to the CSR the previous emails, filed a compensation request, and filed a general complaint nearly every day.

Feb 22: I received a transfer of 2x my parents' original flight to my account. No emails/updates---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think annoying them helped.

I now need to try to receive compensation for my parents' damaged baggage.

You can try to call the call center but they were never helpful when I called and the wait was sometimes quite long (the longest was 40min)

Also HIGHLY recommend only paying flights on a credit card so you can easily dispute. Also, HIGHLY recommend AMEX.

Hope this is helpful or brings reassurance to someone.",Successfully received compensation from Condor,,BlaBlah_12345,,0,2023-03-24 19:10:14

travel,"Hi, I'm turning 30 next month and would like to do something special to celebrate. I want to do something challenging and I've been looking at the camino de Santiago / tour de mont blanc as I've got friends who have done both and loved them but just wanting to see if anyone else has any similar ideas? 

I'll be going from 22nd April - 30th / 1st May so around 9/10 days. I'm not crazy fit but I do cycle 16 miles round trip to work twice a week so I'm not crazy unfit and I love walking and hiking generally. 

Price isn't too much of a problem but would prefer to keep it cheaper if possible. I'm based in the UK so anywhere in Europe would be great. I'd also like some sun as this will probably be my only big holiday this year. 

I'm neither super social nor anti social, I'll happily fall in with a group of people or just plod along on my own listening to a podcast or enjoying the scenery, probably a mix of both would be best. Don't have any dietary requirements, don't really want to camp so would rather stay on hostels. I speak French, a bit of Spanish and will give any language a go really. Can't think of any other info that would be useful but if there's anything please feel free to ask!

Bit of a background: I am an Indian national with a US green card, I live on the US east coast. 

I was planning to book my travel to Havana for 4 days. However, when I went on the United Airlines website, it has the following alert:

*Travel to Cuba is available for authorized travelers only.*

*The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (""CACR"") administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury (""OFAC"") authorizes only certain categories of travelers for travel to Cuba. Tourism is not permitted. All passengers traveling on United Airlines to or from Cuba must certify their eligibility under one of the authorized categories and have the necessary visa. For more information, see our* [*Travel to or from Cuba*](https://www.united.com/ual/en/US/fly/travel/destination/international/cuba.html) *page.*

When I went on that link, it specifically mentions ""Travel for tourist activities is strictly prohibited"". It looks like Tourism is not permitted anymore?

Now I've been to all three cities, but in the case for London, the only time I visited in the last ten years was during a long layover so I only had 2-3 hours in the city other than that i havent been in years. For Munich, I visited the city for a day when I was like 12. Berlin however was the last trip I made before COVID (back in August 2019) and turned out to be one of my favourite places I've ever been to, the difference this time being that I'd be a solo traveller as opposed to visiting with family, there's also things I didn't get to see when I was there last that I would've liked to have seen.

As mentioned above I'll br a solo traveller, if I was to visit any of these places I'd love to do the typical touristy attractions, eat some good food and maybe also do a bit of shopping. Nightlife isn't a major priority to me since I don't drink alcohol but I wouldn't say no to going out if the scene is good.

I am in the early planning stages for a trip in the first week of May to Israel and Jordan. I was hoping to visit Palestine as part of it.

Draft itinerary below:

Day 1 - land in tel aviv

Day 2 - 3 - tel aviv

Day 4- Jerusalem

Day 5 - fly to Amman

Day 6 - Petra

Day 7 - wadi rum

Day 8 - travel back to tel aviv

Day 9 - flight home

Thoughts? Am I cramming too much in? I will be living out of a backpack so nothing heavy duty in terms of lugging luggage about!

I‚Äôve been trying to research transport. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt drive but I understand there are buses and trains between tel aviv and Jerusalem. 

What would be the best way to access Jordan? By tour booked in advance from Israel? Or is it worth flying to Amman myself and organising a tour to Petra/wadi rum from there myself? 

How easy is it to get into Palestine (and back) to Israel (presumably Jerusalem is the easiest access point?). I‚Äôd be interested in a tour of the Palestinian side - any suggestions of ethical companies would be welcome!

It was a horrible experience. No online check in was possible in Gran Canaria, so we were in anxiety about how long it will take for us to do check-in and they gave us no info about when the check-in will open either. Then we realized that we reached the airport too early(3 hours before the flight time) because of not knowing when check-in will open, only to find that check-in was only possible only 2 hours before the scheduled flight time.

Once, we were done with check-in, the flight was told to be delayed by 40 minutes but the journey ended up being delayed by 1 hour at the destination. Once we reached there, there was only 1 exit for a medium sized Boeing 707, with more than 250 passengers on that plane. It took us nearly 15 minutes to exit the plane. Then we had to take a bus to the airport which took about another 5 minutes. I've never experienced such horrible exit from any other plane in my life.

All these delay accumulated to a nearly 1.5 hours of delay, which meant that we missed our connecting train to our destination, despite having an original gap of 90 minutes. It caused us so much problem because it was already evening and alternative train connections were hardly there. Fortunately, despite all these problems caused by the Corendon Airlines, we found another train connection without paying anything extra for the long distance trains, but cost us 2.5 hours of delay (plus 15 euros of taxi cost as it was too late, at 2 am in the morning, to take the local tram within our medium sized city) .

We want to go somewhere tropical like the Maldives, however upon doing research most tropical islands are either in rain season / hurricane season. We‚Äôve looked at Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles and most of the Caribbean. Out of what we‚Äôve looked at, it appears Aruba or somewhere in Mexico like Isla Mujeres would be perfect. However, it seems impossible to find any package holidays from the UK to these destinations? Is it a case of booking the hotels and flights separately?

I'm planning a ~4 month trip to New Zealand and the South Pacific for 2024, and I'm trying to decide if I should take it in the Southern Hemisphere Fall/Winter (March‚ÄîMay) or Winter/Spring (August‚ÄîNovember).

I'd like to spend 2 months exploring New Zealand and 2 months exploring other island countries in the South Pacific. My goals are decent weather for hiking, lower crowds, and lower prices, so I'm considering two shoulder season itineraries:

**Itinerary 1:**

* March: New Zealand South Island
* April: New Zealand South Island, North Island
* May‚ÄîJune: Fiji, Vanuatu, other countries

I also have February free, but I didn't see an obvious place in the region to spend that month‚Äîany suggestions? I considered Australia, but I'm concerned about the summer heat.

**Itinerary 2:**

* August‚ÄîSeptember: Fiji, Vanuatu, other countries
* October: New Zealand North Island, South Island
* November: New Zealand South Island

travel,"Long story short, he booked a cheap flight to Edinburgh, Scotland a few months back without fully understanding it. Overall, it was supposed to go: board in USA, fly to London, fly to Edinburgh, stay a few days, Edinburgh back to London, London back to USA. He decided to skip his first Edinburgh flight and go to Italy instead, he then took a train up to Edinburgh, thinking he could catch his remaining flights home. Instead, he no longer has tickets home, as American Airlines will apparently cancel your whole itinerary if you ""no show"" a flight. He's now trapped in Edinburgh with less than $100 to his name. 

Does *anyone* know what we should do? I have no idea where else to look for advice. This doesn't even seem legal to me, but his tickets were crazy cheap so who knows. I don't have the ability to bail him out of this. Is there anyway we can get those tickets back? Does anyone know of a way to get back to the states that costs less than $1k?

Orbitz has some packages, one is for Hotel St Pierre in the Latin Quarter. The Latin Quarter is where I would prefer to stay since a lot of the places I want to see will be there. I'm a big fan of the movie Before Sunset. I'd love to see the places they walked and visited in the movie :)

I would also like to see Versailles if time allows. Eiffel tower, the catacombs, Musse d'Orsey, Pantheon, Montmartre are all on the list as well. 

Orbitz has, with the round trip flight on Air France and 8 nights at Hotel St Pierre for $3,512 US dollars. 

I have never been out of the country before so this all new to me. Is this a decent price? Any other suggestions that anyone has, please let me know!

I have been reading the content and think I know what to do. I just have a question about application. I'm looking to fly to Melbourne from OKC or Dallas the last week of June and return the first week of July. If I book just a week earlier (and most weeks prior), the flights are up to 1,000USD cheaper! I'm probably oversimplifying things, but I was hopeful that as the date approached, and the last week was as far out as the weeks prior, the prices \*might\* look similar.

It looks like there is a 4-10 week sweet spot on average, based on the FAQ and other guides and experiments here. I just got a little lost, because it seemed like there may be a ""if costs are changing"" clause. The flights I was monitoring increased by 400USD over the course of one day. Only a few Dallas flights dropped.

So I am wondering if the apparently wild fluctuation should change my strategy? I wasn't sure what to do with that based on all of the guides here.",Applying all of these principles to get to Melbourne,,KaleMunoz,,1,2023-03-23 21:03:50

At the moment I've been thinking of either Latvia (Riga), Lithuania (Kaunas or Vilnius), Estonia (Tallinn) as I'm booking with pretty short notice so it is whatever is available and cheap. However I've also seen flights to Zagreb and various cities in Romania.

I'm going to be travelling on my own, and I would probably like to just walk around a bit in the day and visit interesting site/smuseums and then eat at nice restaurants and drink nice beer for the remainder, I'm not into clubbing but like interesting bars, pubs and restaurants. I'm mostly worried about going somewhere and being bored after a day because I am really a bit too lazy to travel anywhere outside of where my flight goes to lol

The places I mentioned all sound interesting but I don't know much about Croatia/Zagreb and Romanian cities.  I'm also open to anywhere really, ideally in the Baltics area as I've never been there before.

I need to get a USA passport in under 4 weeks (i have a international flight booked for the end of April)  I had a passport when i was younger than 16 so it looks like i'll have to get a new passport instead of renewing.  


What I have found online is that there is a expedited option that takes 5-7 weeks not including the time it takes for it to mail and then the next option is urgent travel which has to be within 14 days before your travel. Then i also have see expeditor companies that say they can get it within 2-9 business days. However i am hesitant with those companies due to them being more risky since they could just be scams.  


Thus my question is what is the best method i could take to get my passport in time of my trip?   
How sketchy would it be for me to book a flight/hotel to Mexico in the next two weeks so that i could make an appointment for the urgent travel on their website it says it requires proof of travel. what exactly do they need and how much do they look into your reasons for travel?

travel," I recently booked a flight with Air Canada to Berlin, which is a code share with Lufthansa. My intention was to fly on a 747-400 before they are retired. However, I encountered a strange issue while checking my booking on Lufthansa's website. My name, let's say it's ""John Doe Smith,"" appeared as follows: First   


Name: John Doe   
Middle Name: Doe   
Last Name: Smith

Despite this, my name was correctly displayed as John Doe Smith on the Air Canada booking confirmation, and both airlines' contact centers confirmed that my name was correct in their systems. Unfortunately, no one could resolve the discrepancy on Lufthansa's booking site. This has left me wondering if this will cause any problems during check-in.

Moreover, I noticed that Lufthansa's website no longer offers advanced seat selection, meal selection, and other options that were available a few weeks ago. This has added to my confusion and concern.

I wonder if by making some meal selections a few weeks ago has caused my ticket not to sync properly with Lufthansa's booking website?",Lufthansa Website/Ticket Issue - Middle NAME DUPLICATED?! (Air Canada CodeShare),,Neat_Onion,,1,2023-03-23 13:50:30

When I went to ask her for it, she asked me ‚Äúwho are you going with?‚Äù I answered by telling her I‚Äôm going alone and she said no because it‚Äôs too dangerous. She never explained why it is dangerous but she wouldn‚Äôt let me get my birth certificate. I told my dad about it and he said that he agrees, asked why I want to go alone, and said even he wouldn‚Äôt do it. I responded with how I‚Äôve wanted to go there for years, and that if I want to go for the first time I want it to be a solo experience. 

I told them both that it‚Äôs one of the safest countries to visit and that I‚Äôd be fine. Granted, I can‚Äôt help with natural disasters, flight delays, and things like that, but overall I feel I‚Äôd be fine. I even plan on getting travelers insurance.

travel,"I'll start with some prelude (possible tl;dr), I hadn't left my home country of Australia until I was 25. I took a voluntary redundancy and travelled Europe to see 28 countries in 2019 (VERY good timing I know!).  
While meeting lots of people on my travels, Europeans particularly of course would say and ask ""I want to go to Australia one day, where should I go?"" Now I travelled around the coast of Aus with my parents as an early teen for the whole of 2006 so I have a good idea about Aus places to see. All I could reply was ""How much time would you spend??"" basically saying 1-4 weeks just stick to the east coast to see Sydney and up to Cairns. Any longer and you'll want to hire a camper like most Europeans do here in Aus to literally go on an outback adventure, maybe see the central and west capitals but definitely see things like the great ocean road, Uluru / Ayer's rock, the bungle bungles, the pinnacles, etc etc.

Point is to above (especially if you tl;dr) it's a time factor how to recommend such a big country that lacks good transport other than cars. I know America is just the same, when I took redundancy it was either the USA or Europe but Europe of course is very easy to do without any plan, I just planned my next movements and booked the next night or a week in advance the transport was so easy.

Getting to now where the world looks a bit iffy but somewhat recovered from COVID19, I've kind of on a whim wanted to start looking at a plan to travel coast to coast and maybe Canada as well. I am back in a permanent full time position where I will probably this time only be able to bank up annual leave over many years. The job I took the redundancy from didn't like you to have over 300 hours banked of annual leave and would try to get you to reduce it. That's basically 2 months solid away from work.

So with that in mind:

1. Would Canada be a possible option as well as the US or would it become too tight?
2. Dad said when he was over in the 80's or so he was able to buy a basic second hand car and use that until the end and sell it again. Is this still a viable option? No idea how the paperwork would go for a none resident.
3. Do you personally think you'd get enough sightseeing stops along the way in such a small amount of time? How long do you think you'd need yourself if you had to do it quick but wasn't limited? (if that makes sense, length of time to do what you wanted without dawdling but didn't have to worry about end time)
4. Do you personally think it's worth fitting in destinations you could holiday another time easily reached by plane? As in LA, SF, NYC etc. I'm betting not, but I think it's worth asking your opinion  


To help determine better; things I find interesting:

* National parks etc that are unusual like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, Niagara falls, the valley with the president heads (excuse my current ignorance lol) etc
* Big museums, more into science than history but I'd find a balance
* Possible geology, a town would need to have something big and interesting enough to have me stop (a town here in Aus has some dinosaur bones/prints and that's it, not that interesting to me)
* Not sure otherwise at least at this stage, maybe you could suggest some things?

So, we're yet to finalize the interior design and I'm seeking suggestions from tourists on what they expect, in terms of aesthetic pleasure or convenience. What are things that you've found very useful at hotels/resorts? What ""attention to detail"" from the hotel's side have gotten you excited?

Which would make for a better trip (based on culture, food, architecture, history, beaches/natural beauty etc.) based on your experiences? Any cities worth removing from this last, or swapping out? 

Not really considering Madrid since they'll get the big city vibe in Paris and Barcelona. They'll get the beach in Mallorca, big city in Madrid+Paris. San Sebastian is great for food, however, is it worth skipping Grenada/Sevilla over? Sevilla and Grenada sound like the quintessential charming Spanish cities.

Essentially the main difference of the itineraries below is doing Grenada+Sevilla or San Sebastian and another town/city in northern Spain. We're torn since we've heard great things about all three places.

***Itinerary 1***

\- Fly to Barcelona, 3 days in Barcelona

\- Train to Grenada in AM, then a full day in Grenada

\- Train to Sevilla in AM, then 2 full days in Sevilla

\- Fly to Mallorca, 3 days in Mallorca 

\- Fly to Paris, 3 days in Paris

***Itinerary 2***

\- Fly to Barcelona, 3 days in Barcelona

\- 2 days to take time driving to San Sebastian, then 2 days in San Sebastian (can also fly there and add a day to another city)

\- Fly to Mallorca, 3 days in Mallorca 

\- Fly to Paris, 3 days in Paris

My flight from AMS arrives in LHR at 20:55 at night on April 20th. My flight to TLV doesn't leave LHR until 8:20 in the morning on April 21st. Do I need to go through any sort of passport control when I first arrive at LHR (coming from Amsterdam)?

When I get back to LHR for my next flight (to Israel) will I have to go through passport control? If so, how long does this usually take in the morning?

Is there anywhere at LHR for me to temporarily store my carry-on backpack while I have a fun late night/early morning in London?

Does anyone have any recommendations for fun/interesting things to go do or see in London between the hours of 22:00 and 5:00?

travel,"I turn to this community for great suggestions and advice.

I have a favorite place in the Mexican Riviera and have been 4 times. It is small - some might argue too small - and now I'm thinking I could go elsewhere.   For Dominican Republic: I have only been to Santo Domingo &amp; Playa Boca Chica.   For Puerto Rico: I have been to Vieques which is amazing but somewhat obnoxious to get to (another internal puddle jumper plane).  Belize: I've been to Caye Caulker twice - it's good.   Costa Rica: Puerto Viejo on Caribe side  - also quite nice and chill, however a 6 hour bus ride from San Jose airport.   Panama: San Blas Islands. Very beautiful. I had a great experience on an overnight on a catamaran.  Potential option to go back but it's more of an adventure.  

Looking for another suggestion.

Criteria:

* budget friendly.  Some Caribbean islands are too pricey.  Hostels are fine, or accommodation up to $50 / night.  I am traveling solo.
* easy flight  from NY/DC/Miami. 
* no crazy loud party scene like parts of Tulum (or think Ibiza) 
* possible activities like reef snorkeling or other nature-based excursions. Love cenotes, that's why I keep going back to Mexico. 
* a good beach. This means not a crummy dirty strip of sand, or the beach has riptides (a lot of the Caribe side of Costa Rica when I visited).  Prefer soft sand and calm turquoise water  Also not fun: the entire beach is occupied by large hotels or resorts and no public access unless you're a paying guest... ugh.

Hope to see some great advice!   Thanks in advance.

I've been travelling for many years and have experience and knowledge travelling many different types of countries (India, Laos, Italy, Vietnam, Mexico, Portugal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka... etc).

My name is McDonald (not actually, but very similar). On my passport, it is listed as Mc Donald, with a space in the middle. I flew internationally in 2019 with my passport spelled like this, and I was listed as McDonald as my ticket, with no issues. I never even noticed that it had a space until now.

However, I have a flight coming up in 5 days with my ticket name as McDonald. My TSA pre-check used the passport spelling of my name, Mc Donald, even though I did not have a space in my name on the application. I was able to add the KTN with no issues to my reservation, but I am wondering if this extra space will cause any issues at the airport? I tried calling TSA, and they were no help at all. I got a generic ""we cannot tell you for certain if it will cause issues or not. Please make sure all your legal document names are consistent."" So, to summarize how it is spelled on each document:

Passport: Mc Donald

Precheck: Mc Donald

State ID: McDonald

Airline ticket: McDonald

Should I leave it as is and hope for the best? Should I call the airline and ask them to add a space in the middle for consistency?

This might be a long shot, but I figured I‚Äôd ask. My wife and I have been planning a trip to Iceland over the summer for our 10 year anniversary. Super stoked! Anyways, we know somebody that would also like to do a house swap with us over the summer. We are in Southern California, they are in Ireland. At first, we thought it would be super easy to add on another week in Ireland since we are already in Iceland. Turns out, not so much. We happened to book non-refundable tickets with Icelandair. We can change the flights for a fee (about $600 total) + the difference in cost for each flight (about $1200 total). Plus we would need round trip flights to Ireland because we would need to fly out of Iceland again (about $1000 total). What we thought would be an easy addition, looks like it would be a few thousands bucks. Anyways, thought I would throw it to the group to see if anyone had insights that we had not thought of.",Extending Trip with Non-Refundable Flights,,xstoopkidx,,0,2023-03-22 18:24:50

I'm not too fussed about wanting a jam packed vacation with activities, I'm fine with a slower paced getaway with nice sights to see, beaches and wine.

travel,"Just saw several posts of people dunking on tipping culture in the US but they really do not understand the concept of how it works and why and the goal of it. In this post I will explain it so people can gain a better understanding. I am a restaurant owner fyi.

First and foremost, the minimum wage in Indiana, and most of US, is 7.25/hour. For an average employee of mine like a chef or regular staff, in today's time you cannot get around paying under $14. Inflation is that high and people value their time and money. For a server in Indiana, the cash minimum wage is $2.13, yet every business I know of pays roughly $4-4.50 for servers. Taxes consist of FICA (social security and medicare), SUTA (state unemployment) and FUTA(federal unemployment. The business and employee each pay these. For the business and individual, FICA is the same at 7.65% of the gross wages. Different than SUTA and FUTA where the business pays a set percentage .5% for FUTA, limit 7,000 per employee ($42 per employee), and states differ. The employee then pays Federal which is based on the amount, marital status, and dependants, state and county tax, resulting in the net check. US average amount taken out of the gross check is 15.3% in total. With this being said, am employee earning 4 bucks an hour is less takes than the one making 15. 

This will be basic guidelines going forward.

The goal of tipping: There are a lot here. Main goals consist of encouraging better customer service, cheaper food cost for the business which then goes to the customer, and representation of customer satisfaction. If a server knows they can make a lot of money from tips, they will generally be better at their job resulting in better customer service. 99% of servers make more than $15/hour. Cheaper price for food is because if I were to hire all my employees at $15, I definitely couldn't stay afloat with the prices I have now, resulting in higher prices which then go to you, the customer. The net result is the same. 

Example time. Employee making $15 per hour gross is taking home on average 12.64 per hour. (15 X 15.5%). 15 - 2.36. Meanwhile the company pays the $15 + 7.65% + 15 which equals 16.15. Servers do not pay tax on tips upfront. The business however, does as it is part of their gross income. A typical server can do roughly 4-5 tables per hour with an average bill being around $50. A low 15% tip equals 7.50. If server does 4 tables, that average is $30 in tips + $4 wage which is $34 dollars. Server will pay the tax on the $30 of tips at end of year when filing tax return, and the business only pays taxes on the $4 wage. Taking taxes out, employee is left with roughly $29 per hour, which is much better than $15, all because of the tips. The average tip in the US is now close to 20%, I used 15% as an example. 

Because me, the business owner, pays the server less upfront, I am able to charge less on the food. Tipping SHOULD be a win-win for everyone: lower food costs for customer, higher income for servers and less expensive for employers, AND higher customer satisfaction due to better service.

This falls apart when....

Some people do not tip, resulting in loss of income when the server did perfectly fine. Maybe a foreign traveler to the US doesn't understand tipping culture and does not tip. Maybe the server got blamed for a kitchen mistake and customer did not tip because of it. MOST businesses do not share tips as a motivation for all employees to work for their own money. The businesses that share tips do not do as well in customer satisfaction. Maybe it is a slow day and an employee only has on average 2 tables an hour, resulting in under $15 per hour. Rare, but it happens. 

For my business, I pay all server employees $6/ hour to encourage good customer service, which does work, and enough to break even with regular employees should they only have 1 table an hour.

travel,"My wife and I have talked about going to Europe for years now but because she is a resident her schedule is very tight and only this year did the stars align for her first ever (brief) trip to Europe. She really wants to see Paris and also wants to see Tuscany and Rome. I've been to all three places at least a couple of times and enjoyed them but generally speaking when I go back to Europe I try to make a conscious effort to balance time spent in urban areas vs ""off the beaten path"" (IMO Tuscany might be a nice balance vs the hectic nature of Paris and Rome in this regard). While I go back to Europe plenty, I've never gone during late May so I hope somebody could offer me some feedback on my \*tentative\* plans.  


We are will be in Europe for a full 12 days, arriving into Paris on 5/22 in the morning and departing Paris on 6/3 at noon. My plan is currently Paris 5/22-5/26 (making an effort to visit Versailles), then fly to Zurich for the weekend 5/26-5/28 (possibly visit Lucerne or Interlaken for a day?). Then take a train to Florence the in the afternoon on 5/28 and see the surrounding Tuscan countryside. Leave for Rome 5/31 real early on a train and depart Rome the evening of 6/2 for Paris.  


As it stands I feel like I'm trying to do too much. I'm the type of traveler who doesn't really ""vacation"" well because I always am trying to see/do as much as I can in my time off and (probably do to my ADHD) have trouble kicking my feet up and relaxing. My wife, in part due to her busy job, enjoys taking it a little slower. With this in mind, would you nix/extend any of these locations? As it comes to Paris, I know we are there for a while. I was considering taking a day trip to Bruges or possible a 2 day trip to Amsterdam.

travel,"Long story short, I have two passports - China and Canada. I'm currently going to uni in Australia with a student visa on my Chinese passport. I am planning to travel to New Zealand next month with my Canadian passport since Canada is a visa waiver country and I don't wanna spend couple hundred bucks on NZ visa application if using my Chinese passport (plus it will take 2 months). 

Problem is, I entered Australia with my Chinese passport (cuz it has student visa), so can I use my Canadian passport to book the flight ticket to and enter NZ, that is, only showing my Canadian passport on the way to NZ. And when I come back to Australia, I only use and show my Chinese passport (to fly and enter Australia). I don't know if this is doable cuz I have never done it. The ultimate issue from what I see is that, when exiting a countries, the custom officer will see a completely different passport than I entered the country with. For example when leaving Australia, the customs will see me use Canadian passport, however I used my Chinese passport to come to Aus, so there's no record of entry on my Canadian passport in the Aus's system. Will they question if I have snuck into the country in the first place? Same goes for NZ, will they catch me cuz I used a brand new passport they have never seen before to leave the country? Especially if they stamp my passport both on the way in and out of the country to keep a record.

travel,"Hi there!

I'm from Hong Kong, thinking about a trip to Turkey and the Middle East during Christmas period. I would likely spend 2-3 weeks there.

Which countries and cities do you recommend the most for a history nerd and admirer of architecture both ancient and modern?

I've done a bit of basic research. For Turkey, I would likely spend 5 days in Istanbul and 2-3 days in Antalya. But I'm not sure about Izmir and Selcuk.

I'm interested in Egypt, but not MUST GO interested, and Reddit is doing its hardest to discourage me from going there. Besides, I'm a solo traveler who isn't used to group travel and having a guide, which is recommended by the people here?

I'm highly interested in Israel, but it seems it can only be reached from Istanbul. I'm also not sure about its safety, particularly in Jerusalem. Google says it's very safe, but online articles have the reputation of painting everything in sunshine and rainbows.

I would really like to spend a weekend in Morocco during my exchange year, so I'm planing on taking the ferry from Spain to Morocco. But here's the thing: The only valid passport I have is my brand new American passport that I got from the US consulate in Germany last summer. I do have a valid German ID card though. 

So my plan is to, before boarding the ferry in Spain, show my US passport to Spanish border officials, then show it again to the Moroccan officials once I'm on the ferry (yes, they actually stamp your passports during the ferry trip), spend my weekend in Morocco, once again show my US passport to Moroccan officials on the ferry back to Spain and, once I've arrived to Spain, show my German ID to Spanish officials. 

Is that how it's supposed to be done? I'm not sure what to show Spanish border officials at the very beginning, before boarding the ferry to Morocco. My US passport (which I've never used before and is unstamped) or my German ID? In other words, I don't know if a EU citizen can leave the EU with a non-EU passport. I mean, I understand if I left Germany, I would need to leave the country using my German passport/ID, but in this case I'm leaving Spain, so maybe my US passport would work? I'm just afraid they look at my US passport and think ""It's completely unstamped, how did you get to Europe then??"" and that my German ID wouldn't work either.

I've spent literal hours looking for answers online and even used Bing's GPT-4 engine but I find absolutely nothing because my case seems a bit special, I suppose. I wouldn't even know whom I would need to ask these things, that's why I'm asking here.

I'm especially looking for places in McLeod Ganj, Rishikesh, Varanasi, and Bodh Gaya.

**Day 12-15:** drive down and explore the southern Israel, spending a night in Jericho, a day/night doing a Bedouin tent stay, a day in Hebron/night in Masada, and a day in Bethlehem before driving to Jerusalem to return the car there and spend the night there

She knows a Texas version of Spanish and we love the culture, food and architecture. Not only that it is also one of the more affordable options.

We both picked a favorite location and we will be planning our trip around that. I picked Granada to see Alhambra and Moorish history and she picked Barcelona for the architecture.

I've explained to her that an itinerary like this would most likely involve skipping Madrid which is a hard pill to swallow.

I need help with what else to skip.


Day 1-3

The itinerary I had in mind involves flying into Barcelona in the morning and visiting the city center when we get there. Then explore for the next two full days.  

Day 4-8 Andalusia 

Here's where the question marks pop up. 

Day 4. We could fly into Seville in the morning which would give us the afternoon to explore. 

Day 5 Explore more of Seville

Day 6 Rent a car and drive to Ronda. Then arrive in Granada.

Day 7 Explore Alhambra.

Day 8 Arrive in Malaga and relax before flying out.

Andalusia feels rushed to me and I feel like we would need to adjust ouritinerary. I've thought about skipping Ronda on Day 6 and instead of renting a car, train hopping from Seville to Cordoba for a day trip then hopping on a train to Granada that evening. But we would have our luggage with us while exploring Cordoba. At least with a rental we can leave or luggage in the car.

I know everyone says to avoid a rental car but they said the same thing when we went to Yucatan MX and we love having the freedom.

The thing is that this year, it looks like I won‚Äôt be able to travel at the same rate as before since acommodation prices in Europe have skyrocketed. My Airbnb has history since 2015. and my booking account since 2014. so I could compare all the prices and it is carzy.

Nowdays my average night costs around 100 euro for two people, in 2019. it used to cost me 50-60 euro for the same accommodation, not to mention earlier years when you could sleep 7 days for less than 300 euros without any problems in places such as ibis hotel or some other place like that which now cost hundereds of euros.

Airline tickets are a nightmare for me too, before I always got tickets for 10-30 euros one way in europe and now they are 2-3 times more expensive (although it‚Äôs possible to find cheap ones here and there) 

My trip to Jakarta was 400 roundtrip from Budapest which is now 1000+ euros, I really cant plan anything more and it is making me anxious even to think about travel, it used to be cheap and everyone could do it if they just spent some more time on the internet.

Sites like secretflying and fly4free provided 10+ cheap tickets per day and now you can only fly to USA for same prices as before where acommodation is even more expensive than in Europe and I need a visa so it doesnt seem that I will visit it anytime soon.

The thing that freaks me out the most is seeing people who never traveled before pandemic visit all of my favorite places and dream destinations which I could afford only few months ago and now it is not possible because of prices. What I mean is that I can actually go to fewer places and days just because I dont want to pay 200 eur for a ticket that used to cost 30, it just doesnt make sense to me.

I have traveled a lot even during the pandemic and it was the best time of my life since every price was even cheaper than before, I just can‚Äôt afford same destinations and lengths of stay as before‚Ä¶

travel,"I‚Äôm starting to put together my plans for a summer trip in Europe and looking for tips and advice on a few things! I‚Äôll be arriving likely in Lisbon in early July, and plan to stay until Oct/Nov primarily spending my time in Spain and Italy. 

Some of the challenges i‚Äôm trying to work through: 

1.) I‚Äôm going to be traveling with my dog the entire time! He is an ESA and i‚Äôve flown with him before, but I‚Äôm unsure of what this will look like when taking trains and how pet friendly the rails are. Additionally, for hostels/hotels and should mention he is a large dog ( 36 kilos) 

2.) I was initially considering tryin to find a long term car rental, but read a lot of nightmare stories about the difficulty of driving in cities in Spain/Europe, parking, and then i‚Äôd have to factor in fuel/tolls, etc. So i‚Äôm thinking to just get a car when i need it for a day/ few days and stick to traveling by train? 

3.) Given it will be summer, i plan on heading south and traveling through the south of Spain on my way to Italy. I prefer to stay in fewer locations and take day/weekend trips from one location vs staying on the move. It will also be very hot so I don‚Äôt know if it makes to visit an interior cities, likely stay coastal. I‚Äôm trying to determine what would be the best cities/towns to visit and stay for a few weeks at a time where i can visit other nearby locations and also logistically make sense with access to trains. 

4.) Similar to #3, but specifically logistics/ ideas of places to visit between Spain and Italy. I have a pretty good idea of what my travels will look like once i arrive in Italy, so i‚Äôm focusing right now on my trip from Portugal to Italy.

We fucked up and used kiwi to get our flights (lesson learned) on the way out here our flight misses a connection between two different airline and whelp sucks to be you was everyone's consensus. We had to eat the cost of a new flight.

Now weeks before our return flight we get an email from kiwi saying that our flight from Amsterdam to pairs was cancelled and to pay $400 more for a different flight. We have a connecting flight from pairs to LAX. So we decided to eat the cost again and take a train to pairs. 

Kiwi won't refund anything. We tried to contact transavia (airline that cancelled between pairs and Amsterdam) through WhatsApp?!? And requested a refund for the one flight but it's been a week and haven't heard anything. 

I'm really worried now with how shitty kiwi has been or with the condition of pairs, that something will happen to our return flight. Kiwi also keeps emailing me telling me that I need to replace my connecting flight back to LAX and I'm afraid they will cancel it.

Our plan right now is to eat the cost of the connecting flight again and take the train to pairs and the flight we already have back home. Is this a bad idea? Should I call my back and tell them to block the whole cost of the tickets and just try a totally different flight?!

Everyone warned us that we were going to get pick pocketed in Italy, we didn't have a single problem with pick pockets, but no one warned us that the airlines were going to rob us left and right.

1. Alicante - 2.2hr train from Madrid, a different coastal vibe - time could be chewed up on trains from Madrid and to Barca, however. 
2. Do more time in Madrid and Barca and add some day trips (Toledo, Tarragona, Girona etc).
3. Valencia - seems maybe an obvious selection, but I was looking for something a bit different.

I  am thinking about going solo traveling in South East Asia for about  \~2-3 months in 2023/2024 (either late fall or early spring). I've always  had a travel bug and have traveled extensively with family all over  Europe/US/Caribbeans, however have never been to Asia or solo traveled.

I am 26 and thinking about doing the following countries: **Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Singapore.** I also have a desire to visit **Uzbekistan**,  however this is TBD. I had planned a tentative trip pre-pandemic,  however it had all fallen through. I have since gotten FOMO and  regretted my decision ever since for not pursuing traveling - feeling as  if I was too old to solo travel.

None  of my friends would be willing to go for more than 2-3 weeks, therefore  I was thinking of perhaps also doing a group tour (perhaps at the  beginning) to wet my feet into this whole solo traveling thing.

I  have gone through G travel, Contiki and Intrepid, and was wondering if  anybody had any previous tours and/or feedback to share. I was surprised  to see the prices (e.g., up to$4750 for a 30-day tour through G travel,  as I always expected Asia to be much cheaper), however I'd feel  comfortable spending upwards to $10-12k during those 2-3 months in Asia.

If anybody has groups to share, or even itinerary, it'd be highly appreciated!

Wanted to share because I know many of you are probably leaving money on the table when it comes to repricing your flights.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically anytime an airline drops the price of their flight to less than what you booked it for (which happens to me almost every time I travel), you can actually get that difference back from them (part of their policy for most US airlines and lots of international ones too). 

&amp;#x200B;

This has many times pretty much paid for me to take free extra trips (like this time) with almost no effort.

&amp;#x200B;

You can either track the prices of your flights with something like Google Flights and then just call the airline or use the chat on their website to ask for the difference back (it can be a bit of a pain sometimes but definitely worth it for more than $20-30)

&amp;#x200B;

Or what I do nowadays is use apps out there like [Sprout](https://www.usesprout.com/) to do it automatically for free (you just add your flight and they track the price for you and automatically get you the money back). 

&amp;#x200B;

travel,"Hello! Me and my mum are wanting to go away somewhere for 5-7 days at the end of September/start of October. I'm aware this is a bit of a random collection of places but it's where a) we can get cheapish flights to at this time and b) of the places we can get cheap flights to, neither of us have been there before!

My favourite thing to do while abroad is to just walk around somewhat aimlessly exploring wherever takes my fancy, interspersed with visiting historical/cultural sites/museums etc, as well as doing day trips to other nearby places. Mum is similar and we've been on these kinds of trips before, but she probably enjoys a slightly slower pace to a holiday. She does like a busy city break, but she hasn't been abroad in ages so think she would also enjoy a bit of a 'holiday' element to it of nice weather and preferably being on the coast. She's probably a bit less confident a traveller than I am and most of her holidays apart from the city breaks we've done together have largely been more sun, sea, sand type holidays. Important note is she gets insanely seasick, so boat trips are out of the question apart from probably very short ferry trips, but even that's pushing it.

I've been to Croatia before (Split and Zadar) and absolutely loved it, so thought Dubrovnik could be the perfect option for us as I think it hits what both me and mum would want in a holiday, and happens to be the cheapest of all the flight options. However, I've read mixed reviews - that while it's gorgeous it's overpriced, feels like Disneyland, super busy and 5 days there would be too much especially without the ability to go on any boat trips, although I think she would enjoy a day trip to Mostar and/or Montenegro. I also really want to go to Zagreb because the idea of the museum of broken relationships fascinates me, but not sure I can make that happen on this trip given its the opposite end of the country!

I've always wanted to go to Istanbul because I love history and Istanbul has been at the centre of so much history, but I think it might be a bit too much out of my mum's comfort zone.

Athens hits the history notes, but without visiting some of the islands I'm not sure it will hit everything mum wants, and not sure if 5-7 days would be too long. Also the most expensive of the flight options.

I know absolutely nothing about Nice whatsoever!

If you've been to any of these places, what do you think? Would you recommend them? Is Dubrovnik still worth visiting even if it is a bit overdone these days? Alternatively, if you've got any suggestions of European cities/places that have lots of aimless walking to be done, interesting history/culture elements, generally have nice weather around the end of September/start of October, feel safe for two women, are accessible either on foot or via public transport and bonus points offer the ability to relax on a beach, let me know and I'll look into flight options.","Dubrovnik, Istanbul, Athens or Nice in September/October?",,buttfacedmiscreant11,,1,2023-03-20 19:36:27

Im traveling to Spain in April and trying to figure out train travel between cities. Going to Barcelona first then Valencia... 

After Valencia we want to visit:

Granada
Cordoba
Malaga (?)
Seville

then end our trip with Madrid.

Does anyone have any itinerary suggestions about which city to travel first after Valencia and if train (or if only bus) travel works between the cities?

travel,"As the title suggests, I am traveling to Europe and need advice with my itinerary. I am traveling solo, and know where I want to visit, but am struggling to decide how many nights to spend in each city. I am traveling with a budget of $2,500 and would like to see as much as possible for cheap. 

I booked a flight to Reykjavik Iceland that is set to depart on May 8th and will land at 5am local time on the 9th. I would like to spend 2-3 days there then fly to Oslo, Norway and take a series of trains (with an interrail pass) down to Gothenburg Sweden, Copenhagen Denmark, Hamburg Germany, and Amsterdam Netherlands. 

I am planning on spending 2ish nights at each location, but am not sure if some cities are more worth seeing than others. I have a study abroad in Antwerp, Belgium on May 20th, which will be the end of my personal trip.

I have spent $800 on flights to and from Europe, and plan to spend another $200 on a flight from Iceland to Norway. I booked Airbnbs for each night, which are all refundable, and this cost me approximately $700 for the duration of my trip, May 8-20th. This leaves me $800 left for food and entertainment, which I believe should be enough.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated on free or affordable things to do in each city, as well as suggestions as to how to properly allocate time in each of the 6 countries. Otherwise, I will probably spend equal time in each.

21-23: Cologne &amp; Dusseldorf (other than the cologne cathedral, not yet decided what to do in both of these locations)

Now I am considering just spending all 4 nights in Lucerne instead, but take day trips out. My questions are:

Hello,

We planned a trip for 2 in Peru in August 2023. The itinerary includes Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley, Paracas, and of course Lima.

We have already bought the flights (nonrefundable, but we can change destination) and hotel near Machu Picchu (nonrefundable).

Do you think it will be ok to travel? Will we be able to find everything open to tourists?

Places peaking my interest are the Tatacoa desert, La Guajira desert.

Considering a July start, with something like 

Kazakhstan
Kyrgyzstan 
Tajikistan 
Qatar or Dubai
Egypt

We travel very slowly since I work remotely and can't do much during the week. We will spend about 4-8 weeks in each country as a result, except the pit stop in Qatar/Dubai.

We've done all the Caucus countries and Siberia so assuming it will be a somewhat similar vibe?

travel,"I am 42 years old, lost in life, looking to escape this greedy hell-hole of a country for a while (even if you're a 'patriot' don't fight me on this. We just legalized hard drugs in BC, and legalized government paid assisted suicide in Canada (Bill C-7), and both during a major health crisis.. This country is fucked..).

Before I get into my situation, basically what I'm looking for is a decent place to go, where there's enough city that I can access my funds over there without risking getting robbed due to carrying a wad of cash around on me, and maybe hit a McDonald's if I get tired of living too healthy, but I mostly want to interact with the poor, help them/offer them a meal where I can, talk with them, maybe even befriend some to work out a deal to teach them English in return for them passively schooling me in Tagalog. 

And what I've made this thread for, is suggestions on what areas of the Philippines would be best for what I wish to do. I want to take in their culture, not just see flashy crap like some ritzy tourist. Oh, small side note, I'm basically terrified of spiders, so please take that into account. I can handle a spider or two (long as they aren't those fabled ones I hear about, that are the size of housecats), but if entire sections of the areas are infested with them, then that will be harder to cope with. 

I can't currently think of a better country to go than the Philippines. Reasoning being, friendly people, actually friendly people, not just these ""polite"" Canadian types that put on friendly faces for vanity. 

Before anyone says it, NO, I do not just need to ""get a job"", ""get laid"", ""seek therapy""(which would only end up suggesting any of the other options I've listed here..), ""get drunk/stoned"" .etc. I'm sick and tired of these ignorant mainstream suggestions. What I need, is real purpose in life (not just busting ass to shovel more money to the top of some corporation..), and that won't be found from money, or short term dopamine boosts. I want to embrace a culture that hasn't been completely destroyed to their core by westernization. Because westernization propagates entire societies full of miserable people with commitment issues so bad, that they cringe at the thought of random conversation.  

I don't have a lot of money(2-3k saved), and I'm on disability. There's no opportunity for me here unless I want to bust ass for the next decade in schooling and then another decade in paying off that schooling, and by then I could be dead (average lifespan for men in Canada is around 55, and given my life/financial situation, and diet, I doubt I'll be breaking any records with my lifespan). 

I just want to actually get out and live. I've been behind a screen for far too long, and I feel dead inside.

travel,"I was attacked(?) in Brazil this morning, and if anyone has any insight as to why it happened, and what I can do in future to prevent it, I'd appreciate it.

This morning, I left my hotel in S√£o Paulo in the central area around 8:30am and caught an Uber to the bus terminal. The route took us through a 'rough' backstreet, and we came to a halt at a red light. Mistakenly, I had allowed myself to be comfortable such that I was on a phone call. I also had my big backpack next to me.

A rough-looking man is walking by and starts staring at me - a really spiteful and resentful look. I look back at him, worried he's going to do something. He keeps walking, and a few seconds later I hear a loud crash - the passenger window is shattered. He had thrown a chunk of a brick through the window. I expect to see this man appear at the window demanding my things, but he seemingly keeps walking.

Still, I implore the driver to drive ahead (we were the only car at a red light - there was no traffic), but he doesn't, and shakes his head, and seems more irritated and angry than fearful. The most perplexing/worrying thing for me is that there was a police officer perhaps fifty metres ahead who would've seen the whole thing, yet did nothing. My driver drove slowly past, making gestures to him as though to question him, and the police officer ignored him.

I'm trying to understand why this happened, and what I can do to prevent this? I'm not due to fly out for another two weeks, and while part of me wants to leave sooner, another part thinks that'd be irrational.

This guy didn't seem like a junkie, he had the appearance of a 'skinhead' and seemed angry that a rich Westerner would come through his neighbourhood - I'm not sure how much the fact that I didn't seem to be intimidated (by using my phone) or was somehow disrespectful by using my phone plays into it. I also don't understand why he would do that without having the intention of robbing me? How did my Uber driver immediately know he only meant to intimidate and wasn't a further threat - he didn't drive away immediately? Why did the police officer ignore it?

I'm also worried because it seems as though there is little I can do to minimise this. You can stay in safe areas and go to only safe places all you like, but all it takes is for the wrong person to see you at a red light when you're in an Uber/Taxi, and your safety is at risk.

Obviously, Cairngorms is in the opposite direction of Skye from Inverness, but I'd really love to see it instead of heading straight to Skye.

We‚Äôre thinking of arriving 9/15 to be in Munich for the beginning of Oktoberfest and flying out of Ljubljana 9/23.

My family is planning to fly into Paris, stay in Paris for a day or so, head to Normandy for the day, and then train/fly from Paris into central Europe.

Trying to figure out summer travel plans and can‚Äôt decide between Grand Cayman and The Bahamas (Nassau and then taking a boat to another island).

Other option would be Belize but I‚Äôve heard the beaches there are more like piers and there aren‚Äôt too many actual sandy beaches. My kids love playing in the surf and sand so we are really looking for clear water and good (doesn‚Äôt need to be huge or fancy) beaches.
 
If anyone has any experience with kids at any of these places, I would love your input. Is the Atlantis a total zoo or well done but busy?

I booked a return flight to Thailand a few months ago with an agent and eventually decided to change my flight date to later. I was quoted the price of around ¬£320, I paid and they sent me the tickets. The official Emirates ticket they sent didn't say a cost breakdown for the changes. I became sceptical and spoke to Emirates who sent me my ticket which states the change fee (¬£100) and no other charges (no tax fee and no fare difference) whereas my agent quoted ¬£72 tax difference and ¬£156 fare difference. 

I believe I have proof of being overcharged. The agent is an ABTA member and so I have emailed the agent first with my claims (many photos and evidence of WhatsApp conversations with the agent themselves as well as live chats with Emirates, including one where they tell me specifically that, according to my ticket, the charges were ¬£100) and have told them I will go to ABTA if I don't feel a satisfactory resolution.

From there, I want to travel elsewhere, but I don't know if 4 hours to go and 4 hours to come back is worth it for a day trip to Dubrovnik? Should I go to Zadar instead? Perhaps cross to Mostar and even continue to Sarajevo (then I should make the same journey back to Split) 

Or, is it better if I stay and island-jump from Split to Hvar, Brac etc. This is my last option because I feel that I will be too tired to island-life after a whole week in Murter. I would also like to add some smaller excursions such as Trogir or Sibenik. 

Of course, I'd like to do it as hassle-free as possible, so out of all the options I mentioned I would just pick Split + one big city day trip + one smaller excursion. What should I do, Reddit?",Dilemma about where to spend my time in Croatia,,yobdasenca,,1,2023-03-19 16:41:11

Were wrapping up 90 days in Schengen countries by mid August and we‚Äôre planning on visiting non-Schengen countries for another 90 days from mid August to mid November. We‚Äôre planning on being back in Schengen countries after this through the holidays.  


We‚Äôve initially planned on spending most to all of our time in the British Isles. We were thinking 90 days with long term stays in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. My family history traces back to Cork Ireland so we are for sure planning on visiting there. The only other caveat during this time is my wife wants to experience Scotland for Halloween. Other than these aforementioned requirements we don't have any specific preference on where we go or stay. We'd like to experience historical sites and build that into the education portion of our trip though so visits or stays in cities like London will have to happen.  


We‚Äôd like to experience travel via train as much as possible and we need to stay in AirBnB‚Äôs for the long term stays discounts plus the need for a kitchen to cook often. Also our kids will be starting up school again while we‚Äôre there. They homeschool Monday‚Äôs through Thursday‚Äôs with a field trip on Friday‚Äôs that tends to have an educational or outdoor focus. As a family we value comfort and scenery with a like for outdoor exploring, hikes, and access to the occasional awesome restaurant.   


Given this information what cities should we look to stay and what dates? I figured 4 weeks in an AirBnB in 3 out of the 4 countries mentioned. Not sure if we should make Wales a long weekend visit with a stay in a hotel or consider the same for England. Looking at the national news lately England has seemed less appealing to me but that's probably negative reaction to the negative news. We read someone's experience on the travel sub recently to London was amazing and they stayed on the outskirts of the city for pretty cheap for an entire month.",British Isles Tour,,sarge101st,,0,2023-03-19 11:16:46

travel,"I'm thinking of around May, yet am open to different dates. Basically, I was looking at the 88 temples shikoku pilgrimage in Japan in cherry blossom season. It feels like it may be better to do in four stages. Is that better or doing it as a whole is better?

Wants:

1. to go on a pilgrimage
2. if guided with a women‚Äôs retreat, important that it‚Äôs medicine women/sacred women/goddess/ancestral   (some lingo like that)

Questions

1. 88 temples shikoku pilgrimage in Japan is what I have been drawn too for her. Are there any specific websites I should look for research in this other than the obvious ones on Google? 
2. What other pilgrimages are available? in Japan, or worldwide; which are quite chill and flat in nature, not like super vertical mountain climbing the whole way.
3. Should she go with a guided tour company or alone? 
4. if she were to go alone, would it be better with a solo japanese guide?
5. Best website to find guided tours, just to weigh my options?

(We did it before, but missed out on London because of COVID restrictions). However, my sister is far from becoming sure wether or not she could go due to work. She wanted me to book my flight first because regardless I am going to go due to having a travel credit expiring at the end of the year.

My question is, I really have only an interest in Sweden and would rather save London for her one day. But being as there is a chance she may go, what flight should I book for myself? I want to book early due to the cheaper rates and points rewards rates.

Should I book my flight to Sweden (which layovers in London for 2 hrs) and if she does come, I buy another flight from Sweden to London for a few days then back to Sweden to catch flight home?

Or do I book the flight to London anyway and then my separate flight to Sweden, and if she doesn't go I can kill a day or two on my own in London just to explore a bit?

I posted recently about planning a trip to Switzerland with my parents. Looking at all the things to do, it seems like paradise‚Ä¶ to me as I love hiking and walking. 

Probably not so much for my parents. They can walk fine and are use to city exploring, but most places/activities I have seen mentions some for me of hiking involved. A ‚Äúshort‚Äù hike is considered to be around 1.5 to 2 hours, possibly on an incline as well - this last bit I‚Äôm not sure if they can handle. 

For example, I think you can take the cable car halfway up Mt Rigi, but still need to complete the trip with a short hike. If visiting areas around Interlaken, I am sure the towns and villages are very beautiful but is it a waste if no hiking is involved?

They are used to city breaks, but everyone has said that the best part of Switzerland lie beyond the main cities. I am just worried that, if we don‚Äôt do any hiking, we are not getting the full bang for our buck (so to speak, and in real monetary sense as well - crikey this will be an expensive trip üòÇ)",Switzerland - if one does not like hiking‚Ä¶.,,alltheokonomiyakis,,1,2023-03-19 09:35:18

travel,"Hello! Me and my wife are planning a Switzerland itinerary for this late summer/early fall for 10 days, never been to Switzerland so any advice would be appreciated! Trying to keep this a relatively relaxed itinerary to be able to take our time and have room to explore off the beaten path if we find interesting things.

Day 0 - Arrival: Arrive in Zurich by plane in the afternoon, check into hotel and unwind/explore the city a bit.

Day 1 - Zurich: Visit the Lindt Chocolate Factory as well as the Beyer Watch and Clock Museum, explore the city/find good restaurants.

Day 2 - Lucerne: Travel by train to Lucerne, explore the city. Check out the chapel bridge, lion monument, Musegg wall.

Day 3 - Museum of transport/go to Jungfrau region: Spend half day at the Museum of Transport and then travel by train to Wengen.

Following 4 nights (at least) will be spent in Wengen

Day 4 - Mannlichen/Jungfraujoch: Head up to Mannlichen and do the panoramic walk down to Kleine Scheidegg. From there travel up to Jungfraujoch.

Day 5 - Lauterbrunnen/Murren: Walk down to Lauterbrunnen from Wengen and explore valley, check out Staubbach falls and Trummelbach falls. After that explore Murren and walk to Gimmelwald if we feel like it.

Day 6 - Grindelwald: Go to Grindelwald and do the hike from First to Bachalpsee, then ride the First mountain cart to the bottom. Explore the town of Grindelwald as well.

Day 7 - Interlaken/Brienz: Do paragliding in Interlaken in the morning, then do a boat cruise on Lake Brienz and then hike Aare Gorge (not sure if this day is too crowded)



Here I am split between the following 2 choices:

Day 8 - Schynige Platte/Thun: Train to Schynige Platte in the morning, hike in the area then afterwards go to Thun and visit the castles in the area (Oberhofen Castle, Thun Castle)

Day 9 - Not really sure what to do, could move some things around and do something extra in the Berner Oberland area like the Murren via Ferrata or move something from Day 7 here too, then take the train back to Zurich in the evening.

OR

Day 8 - Gruyeres: Take an early train to Gruyeres, explore the town and see some things like Chateau Gruyeres and the HR Giger Museum and/or Tibetan museum.

Day 9 - Go to Maison Du Gruyeres and maybe Maison Cailler and then take the train back to Zurich.


Day 10 - Leave Switzerland from Zurich airport in the morning


If I do the first option of staying longer in the Interlaken area, wondering if it's better to not spend all the nights in Wengen and spend the last 2 nights in Wilderswil instead since most of the activities are in the Interlaken area?

Trying to decide if it's worth taking the long journey from Interlaken to Gruyeres to see the Cheese factory mainly (I do like cheese but not sure how big/worth it the factory is), plus some extra things like the Chateau Gruyeres or spend more time in the Jungfrau region and see Schynige Platte/Thun castles instead Any input would be appreciated!",Rate my 10 day Switzerland itinerary!,,OrangeJuice225,,1,2023-03-19 06:04:46

travel,"Got this awful experience when trying to reschedule a flight for my daugther and wife from US to Brazil.  


Scheduled a one way flight last year to Brazil via American Express Travel for me, my wife and my daughter (baby, on lap option) and it costed me $ 1,150.65 total with **American Express Travel Insurance**

We were supposed to fly to Brazil in February / 2023 , but I had to cancel it because of family issues.  
I made sure that I cancelled it 1 month before the actual flight so I wouldn't get any worse consequences.  


Then I rescheduled recently for my wife and baby only (to go this april 28th) because I had to stay since I got a new job, but when I called them they told me they couldn't reuse the entire credit because each passenger had to use their respective credit. Since I wouldn't go, my own credits were useless.  


I was like fine, but then there was another catch, we had to pay per passenger $ 270.40 dollars (change fee) and pay out of pocket the difference of the flight tickets for that day. So basically:  


\- $ 270.40 x 2 (change fee)   


\- $ 550.40 out of pocket difference  


Whopping $ 1091.20 more to pay on top of my already paid ($ 1,150.65)  


Is this normal? Just sharing it here because I felt a huge injustice here, since I cancelled it early and it is just one person with a lap baby with an one way passage.",Copa Airlines + American Express Travel - Terrible reschedule experience,,CommunicationNo7772,,0,2023-03-19 01:01:47

travel,"Looking for some feedback on the general flow of our early-September,10-night Bali honeymoon itinerary. Nothing is booked yet so any and all details are subject to change pending insight from those familiar with the region (we will be first-timers)! 

Our initial thought: arrive via US at 7pm &gt; transfer to Uluwattu (3 nights) &gt; then boat to Gili Island (3 nights) &gt; then return to Bali for our final stop in Ubud (4 nights) &gt; fly out. 

Does that flow make sense and work well? Figure we could do Sideman, Batur, etc. as day trips from Ubud. Does adding in Gili make for too much running around? Also, how would you best suggest we get to/from Bali to the islands?

Lastly, if we include an island does one of the Nusa islands make more sense bc of their proximity to Bali? Just want to make sure we're not spending a significant portion of our time in transit, transferring from one place to another.

I have my Bachelors degree but I have never really known what I wanted to do. Everyone around me has a corporate job and theyre negative and just overall miserable or seem ""stuck."" My parents have never accepted me traveling and  told me I'm not welcomed back if I leave again. They think that I should wait until later on in life to travel and look down on me since I dont have a car and work at a restaurant and don't have a 'real job' and basically have the opposite opinions as them with everything.

I have never liked living in the US and have always felt out of place or uncomfortable staying in the same spot for too long or living like them and just watching my life pass me by. I have an EU passport which is useful but ideally I'd like to travel around the world like a digital nomad I guess.

I have sisters that live near me and I could stay with them if I come back but I really just want a place of my own to come back to.

travel,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm a tall, bearded Western male of partial Egyptian descent. Very ethnically ambiguous, and this is my third time travelling to Egypt and I normally stay with family, so my experience is VASTLY different that that of others. I can get around the country quite easily without being harassed etc., and have experience doing so. 

That being said, I fucking love the driving in Egypt. It‚Äôs definitely frustrating that there‚Äôs hardly any public transportation, and can take an hour to drive from one side of Cairo, for example, to another. But getting into an Uber, or one of those Toyota HiAce commuter vans, feels so great. The drivers are all confident and even though it‚Äôs chaotic, it‚Äôs managed. Controlled chaos is how my cousins and I describe it. 

Weaving in and out of lanes, speeding up and slowing down, my driver yelling at other drivers, everyone smoking, windows open with the warm wind in my hair. Its just such an attack on the senses and its so *different* that it makes me appreciate why I travel: To experience all aspects of a culture, not just its attractions. Appreciating how different driving is in Egypt compared to home made me actively look forward to hopping in a ride and taking off. Its the small things like that that I like. 

Anyways. Obviously I know a lot of folk will disagree with me, and I understand why. It‚Äôs a fucking crazy country! But I never felt once unsafe while being driven around, and found it very exhilarating and reminded me why I travel. 

Cheers!",Also just got back from a recent 10 day trip to Egypt. Perhaps unpopular opinion: I love the driving in Egypt.,,m0bin16,,1,2023-03-18 14:21:59

Apologies,  but after searching online i am still not quite clear on the rules for bringing electronics into Ecuador.  I read it as ""one old and one new"" but does that mean for each electronic - e.g. 2 phones, 2 laptops, 2 ect ect or is it like one new phone and one old laptop and that's it?

travel," Egypt review   


We were planning to visit Cairo and Giza for a week, but 4 days is enough, so we took a 1 hour flight for ¬£117 to Luxor for 2 days which is enough for East and West bank tours and museums. You could get a 10 hour train but it seems hard to book, costs foreigners 350% more and takes much longer than flying. A day trip but car to Alexandria from Cairo might be nice but we didn't have time. Aswan would be an extra trip we didn't do but has the famous Temple of Abu Sibel.   


To find the cheapest dates to fly use Google flights and set flexible dates. Then use the price bar graph to check what other dates are cheap. Can use the Google Chrome extension Jack flights club to enter Google flights information into Skyscanner for accurate prices, or just use Skyscanner of you're not flexible with dates.  


Cairo haa the Egyptian Museum, citadel, tower, park, mosques, bazaars  


Giza has pyramids  


Saqqarra and Dahshur are nearby with pyramids  


Luxor East bank has Karnak and Luxor temple   


Luxor West bank has the Valley of the Kings (Tutankhamen's tomb), Medinet Habu,  and Temple of Hatshepsut  


You can find a more complete list on Google things highlights and more to do and TripAdvisor   


If you self transfer to Cairo from Milan you CAN use the transfer section of the airport if you don't have hold luggage and get your boarding pass at the gate, check with staff or if you're at another airport.   


Egypt visa may not be required or could be purchased on landing, our paper or online copies were never checked unless the system was automated  


Sim cards at the airport are the best value, best time to buy, set up for you, but only give half data advertised. This will also give you an Egyptian phone number which is useful for sending and receiving calls. 10 GB only gave me 5 GB before it stopped working but was enough for a week, and my partner got an 8 GB SIM that only gave 4 GB. Data is very useful as WiFi is very uncommon and not having internet will make things much harder.  


Ignore anyone offering help or talking to you unless an official in uniform, scams and hassling is very common. These are from adults and children, almost always Egyptian. If you want a photo or help ask another visitor or your tour guide, or an official like police or site staff. Best way to deal with scams is to ignore or say no. Any interest or even eye contact will result in you being followed and hassled. The common opener to get you talking is asking where you are from.  


Common scams:  
Begging   
Street selling, cheap fakes, putting scarf on head  
Getting you to visit their shop or restaurant   
Taxi   
Advice if you look lost   
Photos  
Tours  
Offering for free then asking for money  
Pretending to be staff to see your ticket   
Letting you into restricted closed roped off area  


In Cairo use Uber to get around and only pay in the app not cash  


Use Viator for tours with free 24 hour cancellation and compare prices with tours offered by your hotel. Check the tour start time as soon as possible as the website advert may not be correct.   


Most tours start at 8 am even if they are offered to start later, they either will still be at 8 am or will rush you to finish by 3-4 pm and you will have less time to see everything, meaning you have to waste time and money to return if you didn't get enough time to see everything you wanted.   


Most museums and sites have last entry at 4 pm and close at 5 pm. Some places are open late like Luxor museum and Al alzer? Park in Cairo which is cheap, ticketed and well lit, has nice food stalls with burger and crepes (if you trust food source) and restaurants.  


In Giza there are several restaurants with good pyramid views and cheap food. In Luxor opposite Luxor temple abido break cafe had great view, food and staff. Sofra is another nice restaurant.  


You can go to sites without a guide but you will understand a lot less, and will have to arrange your own transportation. Most tours seem to take you into shops to buy things for commission which wastes time and money so make it clear you're not interested and ask to leave.   


In Luxor Uber doesn't work, can try using Careem app but drivers don't seem to take payment using app and ask for more money  


Use sun cream to not get burnt and use a light scarf to cover neck or skin. These can be bought cheaply.   


Be careful what you eat and drink to avoid travellers diarrhea and vomiting. Avoid tap water and street food. Bottled water is cheap and cold. Try to eat food in packaging or from restaurants. Avoid overpaying in tourist sites.   


Personally I believe a Nile dinner cruise causes my sickness as I found a hair in the food and at the buffet food had fallen off the serving plates but I have a more sensitive stomach and my partner was fine.  


At the pyramids of Giza you can go inside the small queen's pyramid for free, and Khafres middle pyramid is much cheaper to enter than the Kufus great first pyramid.   


At the Valley of the Kings you can only enter 3 of the free tombs with your entry ticket so research first and choose which you want to prioritise instead of just going to the closest 3.   


It was help to get some cash before you travel. There may be ATMs you can visit once you arrive before you need to use cash like at the airport or if you use Uber to get to an ATM.  


Many places are cash only. Use a bank card as recommended by MSE like Chase, Starling, Monzo, Revolut. Don't use ATM machine that charges fees. Choose to withdraw WITHOUT conversation to get the best rate. Pay by card wherever possible.   


Toilets outside airport and restaurants have a person at the door asking for 5 EGP which seems to be required rather than a tip. They don't take large notes to keep small 5/10/20 notes to pay. They only give small amount of tissue paper for wiping and for drying hands. May help to carry a toilet roll with you.  


Use student card for half price tickets, better if you have an international student card. If you're over 30 some places may refuse to accept or won't take NUS TOTEM but many do accept them.  


There's a tipping culture, people may seems unhappy if you don't tip. Typically 20-50 EGP or 10% is fine. Only tip for things you want like food, hotel, tour, NOT random people on the street giving unwanted items or services.  


[Booking.com](http://booking.com/) seems best for accommodation.   


We stayed at Abo Stait pyramid homestay in Giza. Pros: Great location very close to pyramids, room had air conditioning and private ensuite bathroom and was about ¬£89 for 7 nights in Match paid on the website. Cons: no from desk, just open gate and walk upstairs, not an entire apartment as advertised but a room, hard to contact owner by call or message, slow response for toilet roll and towels, limited English, tours overpriced, breakfast small prepackaged bread, jam and one fruit, drinks extra cost.  


We stayed at Grand Hotel in Luxor. Pros: close to airport, room had a good fan, private ensuite bathroom, very friendly owner offering transport and tours, front desk and lounge where breakfast served with bread, dips, veg, very cheap ¬£16 cash for 2 nights. Cons: minor cons overall like no door, just sink, shower and toilet, fourth floor lots of uneven stairs, couldn't pay card or 3% fee, and paying cash was more than stated on website, 590 EGP about ¬£16 instead of ¬£14.  


Highly recommend owner of Grand Hotel, he arranged a private driver when our tour was cancelled last minute, and able to get a balloon tour for 1200 EGP cheaper than anywhere else at 10 pm for 4 am next morning. Also bought us shower gel, soap, toilet roll for room, and gave extra towel, pillow and duvet all at no extra cost.   


You can wear what you want as a man, and even as a woman seems fine as there are many tourists. Covering is more to avoid sun than attention. Women wearing very short clothes may get more unwanted attention, maybe more so if alone, but I still saw many woman in short clothes that seemed fine. Only in places like mosques may you be asked to cover up.   


Most things for sale don't have prices. Always check prices first, and if no price shown then haggle, as prices often drop a lot lower than the initial asking prices especially if you are willing to walk away.   


There don't seems to be many official supermarkets, we never saw one, just small corner shops without prices or barcodes. You can try food ordering apps as an alternative of you don't want to go out after dark. Tourist areas seems reasonably safe after dark but you will be more vulnerable. As the sign at the hotel said, would you go with a stranger down an alley at night in your own country? If no then don't do it here!

travel,"I'm an American (30m) traveling abroad for the first time for work, which landed me in Randers, Denmark (a small, working-class town). I went out tonight to a bar to experience the local atmosphere. 

People at the bar were playing a version of billiards I'd never seen before (there were 3 balls with 4 pins you try to knock down), and I was interested in playing. A guy came up to me asking if I'd be willing to play against his mother (an older lady sitting in the corner), and I agreed. He seemed to have a genuine vibe to him. She also had a crutch. (I should also note this bar reeked of cigarettes and people were smoking indoors, which I took to mean that's legal in Denmark, but only found out after the fact that is it not...lol)

I played the older woman, and ended up winning (I don't feel like a total asshole because it was a close match...). That meant she bought me a beer and they invited me to sit with them (the older woman and her son) and visit. It was overall a pleasant experience, and I showed them pictures of Danish food I had eaten during my stay and we talked about it while drinking beers.

At one point, the son revealed to me he wasn't actually the woman's son, and they had been friends for 10+ years but he didn't know how to explain that to me easily in English, so he just said it was his mother.  He revealed he's 50 years old and she's 60. It was a funny thing and we laughed. She said she met him while she was waitressing at a bar and he would come in often, and he was in a bad state at the time but has gotten much better. They seemed to have a positive relationship with one another and they cared about each other.

Later on, the guy comes with some slips of paper and writes down his name, address, and phone number, and gives it to me. Put on the spot, and enjoying the vibe, I do the same. Before I leave, he says to me ""Your first visit to Europe was here, my first visit to America will be to see you.""

It was only after reflecting on this whole experience that I feel like an idiot for giving my personal information away like that. Maybe I'm just paranoid (I hope), because I have to feel the chances of this guy actually coming to visit me must be very slim, but now it's in the back of my mind as a possibility some random Danish guy could show up at my apartment...it's also less myself I'm concerned about, and more that my girlfriend lives there too.

I suppose I'm just looking for some solace here and hoping it's just some American paranoia of foreigners that has me concerned. In the end, it will probably just be a fun story that both of us can tell that we had this chance encounter. But it's worth noting the few things I did learn from this guy (that he lied about the lady being his mother, and was in a really bad state at one point in his life) give me the slightest concern...

I've learned my lesson and now have a plan if this comes up in the future (to at the very least, give old addresses/phone numbers), but put on the spot like this for the first time, I just went along with it. 

Is there anything I should really be concerned about here? Or am I just being paranoid?

TL;DR: I'm an American and met a guy at the bar in Denmark, we had a nice time so exchanged information. Now I'm concerned if it was wrong to do so.","I feel like an idiot for giving personal information (name, address, phone number) to a person I just met at a bar in Denmark, who mentioned an intent to visit me in the future.

travel," 

So in a group of 5 young 20s females, everyone's phone is about to die or is dead, and we are stranded at a tourist attraction, so we get in a rogue taxi. This was in a very rural mountainous area. There was a village nearby but it would've taken hours to get their in our conditions. We needed the taxi to get us to our car, which was 40 minutes away.

He was initially sociable and normal. He asked me if I was Swedish. I said no. Then he made a stop outside a random restaurant, and a friend of his walked out to talk to him. It was weird. Then he passed by another car, and started talking to another friend. Then he asked us if we wanted to get out to get water from a ""special well."" We said no. He was texting people in another language the whole time, and speaking to his friend in that language.

I get nervous so I make up a fake story of men we are meeting, and how one of our friends picked up the car and is picking us up in ""the van"" instead. I then stage a fake facetime call. He kept texting after that. The driver starts being normal again. He dropped us off in the area and we paid him.

In his defense, he drove the route to the tea. Idk.",Is this unsafe?,,10throwawayantsy,,0,2023-03-17 21:02:58

travel,"After the horrible reputation the country has on Reddit, I set my expectations for rock bottom. I really mentally prepared for non-stop harassment, touts, scams etc. 

After 10 days in Egypt, I can semi-confidently say that setting expectations low was good, but more importantly it really seems like a destination where you need to be aware of where you're going and how you can adapt.

Egypt has it's issues. It's dirty, noisy, has bad air, and people are waiting to make money off of you. That being said, there are ways to have a good experience. Here's what I learned:

* Have a guide for the Pyramids. You avoid all harassment, and usually they'll negotiate for the horses/camels/whatever.
* Having someone drive you to and from more remote attractions (like the Pyramids) also saves you a lot of hassle. If it's an organised trip through a reputable agency, you also avoid issues at the checkpoints.
* Be aware of the tipping culture. You don't need to tip for everything (despite the whining) and you don't need to tip much. Biggest tip I gave was 5 LE to a toilet attendant, but there were other times I tipped 2 LE or even nothing at all (really depended on the location). I did round up bills in restaurants (amount depending on the service). 
* Don't accept any services you don't want (I was pleasantly surprised by the guys helping with suitcases at the airport on the way back, I was prepared to get rid of my LE but they didn't ask for anything). 
* Carry toilet paper with you
* Don't be afraid to be rude to touts. The guys watch each other, and if you are too nice, every one will try their luck. General modus operandi should be to ignore them, and if they persist, a dismissive hand motion, open outwards palm, or a ""la shukran"". Sometimes you will need to say it twice, but they will get the message. 
* The most aggressive folks tend to be taxi drivers, and they can be annoying if you're waiting for an Uber or Careem (get a local simcard so you can sign up for the latter). If you can, try wait a couple paces away from the hubbub. The taxi drivers leave you alone after a while, but the yelling can be annoying.
* Crossing the street is safer that it seems. Once you understand the Egyptian drivers' mentality, you are much more at ease.
* Learn to read Arabic numerals.
* Egypt is a safe country in the sense that theft and robbery are low. The way you lose money is through giving in to overcharging.
* Cairo and Alexandria were perfectly fine for ""strolling"" as much as that was possible. You don't need a guide for any attractions inside the cities, just some patience.
* I didn't end up buying any souvenirs without a price tag (ended up going to a nice shop in Zamalek), but be prepared to bargain hard. Locals often see it as your own fault if you give in too easily.

I will be very clear that my mode of transport was not the usual one (had a driver), but I hope the broad gist of this post is useful somehow.

Egypt is a very flawed country, but it's so incredibly rewarding as a travel destination. It can improve SUBSTANTIALLY, but I've never before felt like I did when our Pyramid guide opened up a queen's tomb and I saw the wall paintings...

I've heard Luxor is the worst for touts, so I'm curious is anyone had a particularly difficult time there.",Went to Egypt prepared for the worst - ended up really enjoying it,,TrumanB-12,,1,2023-03-17 20:22:51

Aug 21- 26 Stay in Budapest (Would love suggestions for day trips here, we would love to see Eger but not sure how to fit it in) \[5 nights\]

Aug 26 - Early morning train to Vienna (may stop for a few hours in Bratislava)

Aug 30 - Train to Salzburg (may try to fit a wine tasting in the Wachau valley here, and remove a day somewhere else)

Aug 30 - Sept 1 Stay in Salzburg (2 nights)

Sept 1 - Bus to Cesky Krumlov

Sept 1-3 Stay in Cesky Krumlov (2 nights)

Sept 3 - Train to Prague

ADDITIONALLY, they don't even have a customer support team that I can talk to and the only option I was given was through Whatsapp or through text. I followed their guidelines and messaged them through Whatsapp and haven't gotten a response from them for an hour.

travel,"Hi all - I am about to do international travel for the first time with my baby as a new dad and was hoping for some input from others who have been there. There won't be any right answers, but it'd be helpful to hear from folks who have more experience than me, so I'd appreciate any constructive input.  
My little one will be 5 months, and I'll be going with my wife, from the UK to Singapore (where we stop for a few days) then onto Australia (where my family all live, so I'll be in a 'second home').

Specifically, I'm confused about how best to travel with strollers/carriers/car seats etc. Currently, our set up is a 'travel system' (as it's confusingly called), which isn't that travel friendly at all as it's fairly big. It has a pram, a car seat as part of it that click into eachother. We also have a carrier (the kind you strap on like a front-facing backpack) which she likes to be carried in, but i just dont use that often.

Thinking we'd need a travel pram, we've bought a nice compact one that isn't small enough for in-cabin storage, but we can keep baby in the airport and hand over at the gate/airplane. Our car seat capsule also clicks into this too, so she can be wheeled around and be happy. We are also considering bringing her car seat capsule with us because she loves to sleep in it and is familiar with it, and there seem to be a lot of grey areas about booking ubers and taxis in terms of what they provide for car seats, so this seems to take a lot of worry out knowing we have a car seat she likes and works well with our pram. One catch here though is we can't seem to find a good bag to put the thing in for if we check it in.

That all being said, the travel pram is small but not a smooth ride like our bigger pram, and part of me is just tempted to just take our bigger pram and check it in at the start of the airport. I really don't know how much i need a pram in the airport or i should just be putting her in my strap on carrier. And how helpful a smaller more compact stroller is going to be. 

I realise this post is a mess - but that's my brain at the moment! Thoughts really appreciated",International travel with baby - help needed for stroller/carrier/car seat options,,nomadickid942,,0,2023-03-17 16:37:31

travel,"So this is kind of two questions in one post, one that's more travel life advice and one more about itinerary. 

Basically, I love Asia, always have, I spent a year studying in Cambodia and I've tried since then to travel or even work there again but it hasn't worked out that way. 

Now a very good friend of mine has found a job in Phnom Penh, been there for a few months. I've applied to one job in Cambodia before, and researched the country more back then, and I'm definitely very intrigued and at least want to visit. So when my friend went there, I thought I could use my two weeks of summer PTO in July to visit her there

Now the dilemma : my friend's workplace will have a job opening some time in August for a position I am interested in. So I already know I'll be applying, but I don't know when they'll post the job yet (probably April/May) and I probably won't know if I have the job until June or even July

1. Should I book a plane ticket for a two weeks trip to Cambodia for July knowing I'm going to be applying for a job that starts there in August ? 

It feels silly to book a very expensive trip to a destination I might move to just after, but on the other end I have no guarantee I'll get the job, by the time I'll know it will be too late to book flights, and  then it might not be a good time for me to go there with work for a long time, probably long enough that my friend no longer lives there. 

So I'm not sure but leaning towards starting to plan a trip there anyway ? 

2. If I have two weeks in Cambodia, is that too much ?should I consider visiting Laos as well while I'm there, maybe even Thailand ? how long should I spend in Phnom Penh? 

I probably want to spend more time than most people in Phnom Penh because my friend lives there but I also don't want to miss out on the rest of the country because of that. 


Tl;Dr : do you book an expensive trip to visit a country you might move to anyway right after, and if yes, how to spend two weeks in Cambodia ?",To travel or not to travel (to Cambodia for 2 weeks),,smolbibeans,,1,2023-03-17 09:48:07

travel,"Hi folks!   


Experienced traveler (Europe mostly) and looking to add a few countries to my register.  My travel style is very active, I like to keep moving and visiting multiple places as often as possible.  Money is not necessarily a concern based on my frugality, expensive plane tickets will even out.   I'll be having main bases during and travel out from them, I still have yet to figure each of these out, suggestions appreciated.  The numbers listed before each new location is how many times I've been (to offer insight).  Last, I enjoy short visits to new countries and am not worried about only having a few days in a new place to get a taste of it all. This is how all of my trips have started. (Paris 3 days, Italy 4, Iceland 3, Scotland 1.) I like it I travel back. NBD.  


# Rough itinerary: 

(4)  Paris, France  &gt; Visiting (2 pass through) Belguim, (0)  Poland, (1) UK during weekends (very large countries I realize),       (2) Italy  &gt; Staying in each city for a few days or city hopping to reach my new home base.          (0) Spain &gt; Gothic quarter home base and visiting larger cities.      (0) Greece - Staying up to 3 weeks, and visiting (0) Croatia and (0) Hungary (hopefully but have been told on other forums that the logistics during winter may not work).     (0) Singapore - bouncing around or staying in place, I'm unsure of this part of the trip because never having been on this part of the planet I'm a little lost still yet.       (0) Thailand - Don't know much there yet either.       (0) South Korea - currently looking this info up.       (1)   Japan - Tokyo and Kyoto.       (0) New Zealand - to finish out the trip.      (1) Hawaii, to catch a shorter flight home.   


Questions- Winter time - What places are not logical?    What are your suggestions to make the Itinerary more Fluid and better managed?  Suggestions for home bases?    Most places will get a week, some will get 2, where do you suggest I spend the most time?    Plane, Train, or Automobile for travel between countries if time is no concern?     Travel with pets (1 cat)- How? Europe is no concern but Asia seems to be difficult. 

I realize the trip looks a bit all over the place and inconsistent- I'm hoping to remedy that, as well as am willing to take suggestions that offer clarity and insight (traveling in the winter time in some locations may be ill advised etc.)  I would like to keep the trip going in a fluid direction over the continent and eventually landing me on the opposite end with a flight home.   


I'd absolutely love to add middle eastern countries as well as Africa.  (am considering adding Israel as of a very recent travel forum post) Suggestions here would be amazing.

travel,"I feel like an idiot.  I struggled with socks for years; buying the cheap cotton ones from department stores.  They'd either wear through fast or end up making my feet stink or sweat, etc.  I tend to run warmer, so the latter was a major issue I struggled with, especially in the summer (No show socks still caused the issue).  


So I did some research and discovered Merino Wool.  Bought a pair of socks to try them out and despite the price tag, it was a game changer.  No more stinky feet or overheating and so far they're incredibly durable, so I splurged and replaced all my socks with them (Got crew socks for winter and no shoes for summer).  


Anyway, the main downside to them I've discovered is travel - they're bulkier than normal socks, but I figured the trade off was worth it.  


However, I've spoken to a few friends of mine who travel far more than I do and they told me I don't need to pack as many because due to the nature of merino wool, you can actually wear the same pair a few times before they need to be washed.  I just tried at home over a few days and yeah.  Feels good to shave my packing list down a bit - last time I went on a 3 week trip to Italy/Greece in October, I ended up bringing 7 pairs with me.  Going to be able to save a lot of space next time I go on a long trip.

travel,"Hi everyone! 

I would like some people‚Äôs input/advice on my itinerary for my upcoming trip in mid-May. Everything is set up, most with free cancellation, so I can be flexible with changes. However, I will not be changing that I land in Barcelona and will be flying out of Malaga. 


So as of things now the plan is:
6 days in Barcelona, take train from Barcelona to Malaga and stay there for 4 days. The 4 days will be my ‚Äúrest‚Äù days in a hotel on the Costa del Sol, where I intend on just laying around.

However, I have some hesitation about this trip. 

A) I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt be making the most out of my trip, as it‚Äôs only 2 cities and I‚Äôm really exploring 1 of them. It‚Äôs my first time in Spain.

B) I‚Äôm worried that I may be overwhelmed in Barcelona, especially as it seems that it can get very crowded in the summer. I have a private hotel room to escape to if I need refuge, and I‚Äôm not planning on nonstop sightseeing, I do want to take things slowly at my own pace (I will be solo). But I don‚Äôt want to feel limited by my anxiety issues (but I also may be overthinking it).

C) If I were to stay for 6 days, I would want to take day trips from Barcelona, but honestly nothing is really appealing to me near Barcelona. This could be a very ignorant take on my end. I don‚Äôt want to do a guided day trip but I also want it to be relatively easy and simple to visit on my own and that knocks out a lot of possibilities right there (i.e. Montserrat). I also don‚Äôt want to visit a coastal area, as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be doing in the Malaga/Marbella area, ruling out places like Costa Brava communities. Maybe Girona if I were to go somewhere?

I‚Äôm considering cutting Barcelona to 3 days, adding a second city for 3 days, then that hotel in the Costa del Sol. I‚Äôve been looking around, and am drawn to Sevilla and Granada. I think Granada looks gorgeous but with less things to do, and Sevilla doesn‚Äôt have the countryside aspect (at least not as visible) but with more things to do. (I could be WILDLY wrong about these assumptions). If I HAD to choose one it‚Äôd be Granada, but I‚Äôve heard mixed things about how much you can do there over the span of multiple days. But again, I‚Äôm going at my own pace.

Advice on my situation? Are there cities beyond what I‚Äôve said that‚Äôd be good for this change in itinerary? I want good nightlife and entertainment, in an area with gorgeous views. I‚Äôve heard good things about the northern regions as well. I am open to flying between cities instead of the train, within reason cost-wise.",Help needed for a planning trip to Spain,,catmss24,,1,2023-03-16 23:24:56

They would like to spend some time traveling before or after it--they're interested in Paris, Barcelona, Portugal, and northern Italy. They are not terribly experienced travelers and are semi-active. I have questions:

* Is it realistic to hit all those places (besides Switzerland) in two weeks? What would be a reasonable itinerary for people who do not want to be exhausted? Would three weeks be better?
* How easy would it be for them to plot and navigate a European itinerary themselves? Would it be better to get a travel agent?
* They would really prefer a Rick Steves tour, but I can't find one that fits with the timeline and the places they want to go. Are there recommendations for other tour companies like that one?
* Does anyone have experience with a ""semi-tour"" experience, where you cobble together different tours in multiple locations?

I think the ideal situation is a tour group that takes them everywhere, but I don't know how to make it work with the timeline and desired itinerary. I don't even know if the desired itinerary is a good idea. I would just like this to be as easy for them as possible while hitting the places they want to go, and I'm having trouble figuring out where to start.

We are planning somethin from 3 to 5 childrens and the idea is to do homeschooling with them, also contracting particular teachers for what we can tech ourselfs, but for me is quite easy to teach them almost everything a normal school can teach.  
But the question here is not logistical, is moral and psychological, i want my kids to grew up as independent adults, such as psychologicalish, with good knowledge about the world they live in, skills to work if they want or to get in a university also, but also to have good social skills as well, having a social fullfiling life, i don't want them to grew up genious like in the capitan fantastic movie, and complety strangers in the real world.

We're considering doing a quick trip to one of the nearby pueblo magicos (within 2-2.5 hours of the city, by bus) so that we can see/experience a bit more of Mexico with our limited time there. The idea is we would spend a Saturday in Teotihuacan, go back to CDMX for the night, then wake up and head to a pueblo on Sunday and possibly spend the night/Monday before heading back to CDMX. 

So far, I'm interested in/looking at Tepoztlan, Puebla/Cholula, and Guanajuato. But we're open to any of the other pueblos that are worthwhile. I am partly leaning towards Tepoztlan since it seems like it would be lowkey, culturally rich, and there are rentals with a pool (sounds fabulous coming from a colder climate). Or would it make sense to spend the weekend in Teotihuacan? It doesn't look like there much to see past the pyramids. 

I'm not at all sure which pueblo would be the best use of our time - I think we'd prefer to have a bit more lowkey time and explore slowly, but we could definitely maximize and do a full day of touring.

travel,"This is a pretty common itinerary, and I know from reading Reddit posts that people often have questions on how best to split their time between these parks, so I hope this report can be of help to others. 

If people are looking for more details on the individual parks, my reports on [Death Valley](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathValleyNP/comments/11s703n/trip_report_25_days_in_early_march/) or [Joshua Tree](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoshuaTree/comments/11sjm22/trip_report_aiming_to_avoid_crowds_somewhat/) will be more helpful - here I'll focus more on comparing these two parks, plus Red Rock Canyon and Mojave NP. 

**What sort of travelers/hikers are we**: my boyfriend and I are in our mid/late 30s, and are in above average shape, but not very fit. We have a fair bit of experience hiking, but mostly in the east coast. He has a moderate‚Äìmild fear of heights, me somewhat less so. I also have more backcountry experience than he does. We don't mind some fellow hikers on trails, but definitely prefer trails that provide you with a sense of remoteness.

**Our Rough Itinerary**:  
Day 0: Arrive in Vegas at midnight, get rental car, go to nearby hotel.  
Day 1: Morning and afternoon in Red Rock, then drive to Death Valley in time for sunset - stay in the opera house.  
Day 2-3: Full days in Death Valley - spend the last night in Stovepipe Wells  
Day 4: Morning in Death Valley, then drive to Lone Pine and explore the Alabama Hills, then drive to Yucca Valley.  
Day 5-6: Full days in Joshua Tree NP.  
Day 7: Morning in Joshua Tree, afternoon hiking in Mojave NP, then return to Vegas for our red-eye flight back home. 

**Will seven days in the desert get repetitive?**: This was a concern I had, but the answer was definitely no. The landscape of all four of these places was notably different, and within each of the main parks you can experience fairly varied landscapes in different parts of the park.

**Thoughts on how we split our time**: Definitely glad we gave Red Rock a full day - the landscape there is unique and unlike anything else we saw on the rest of the trip, and it's not even a detour, so very much worth a visit. We did the Calico Tanks + White Rock Hills Loop, which I think paired well together. 

Originally, the trip was going to be 3 nights DV, 1 night Lone Pine, and 2 nights JP. But given all of the snow the Sierras had been getting, we shifted plans a bit. I'm glad we still spent an afternoon in Lone Pine though - the drive from DV to Lone Pine is a treat - incredible mountain views and minimal traffic - and even though the Movie Rd. was mostly closed due to flooding, it was still possible to park and explore on foot, which we both enjoyed. Had the weather been different, I'm sure it would be easy to enjoy a full day along 395.

Ultimately, I'm glad we had two full days in Joshua Tree. I had read a number of reports from hikers saying JP is overrated, and while I can see where they are coming from, having two full days meant we had time to see the Colorado Desert portion around Cottonwood Springs - which is currently bursting with wildflowers - as well as time for some of the northern trails with trailheads starting outside of the park, plus the popular trails inside the main section of the park. Two days also meant we could plan to do the popular trails in the morning before most visitors wake up, and then shift to the periphery in the afternoon. 

Unfortunately, it was raining for most of our time in Mojave NP - the rain didn't stop us from doing the short Hole-in-the-Wall Ring trail, but did stop us from committing to the whole Barber Mountain Loop. Mojave NP is very impressive - the Joshua Trees are much more robust than those in Joshua Tree NP, even with the tragic fire in the Cima Dome - those that remain are much more full and healthy looking than in JP - if nothing else, it's worth driving through (provided the roads are open). Mojave NP also makes Death Valley look crowded/developed in comparison - it's really desolate. 

**Death Valley v. Joshua Tree**: We both agreed that Death Valley wins easily, but we still really enjoyed our time in JP, and I wouldn't have changed our itinerary in hindsight - 2 full days in each meant that we hit most of the main spots in both, but DV is the place we both aspire to return to - perhaps in a slightly different season that would allow a summit to some of the peaks in the Panamint Range- not even the trailheads were accessible when we were there. Whereas while we really did enjoy JP, we kinda feel like we more or less saw what it has to offer.

My wife and I have been planning a trip for late September to early/mid-October (2‚Äì3 Weeks)with a budget of around ‚Ç¨3000. We were initially considering Thailand, but we've heard that it's rainy season during that time, and we don't want to risk our vacation being ruined by bad weather.

Considering our budget and time frame, where do you suggest we go? We're open to any suggestions, as long as it's not too rainy during that time. We love exploring new cultures, trying new foods, and going on adventures. Any recommendations are appreciated! Thanks in advance.

Also, just wanted to add that my wife and I are huge fans of tropical islands with nice beaches to swim in.

Unfortunately, my friends had to cancel due to financial problems with taxes. However, my flight was already paid for and so I received a travel credit. (We used different airlines because my loyalty points are at a different airline).

My friends used miles and received them all back but did have a $500 travel credit received for one seat that wasn't covered. 

My friends said they wanted to postpone the trip and maybe do it later or even choose a different destination.

travel,"Hey there,

i¬¥ll be roaming around Istanbul for 4 days by the end of march, so i was hoping that a couple of you might have some knowledge about the city that you¬¥d be willing to share with me. I am open to any useful info, yet i¬¥d be especially curious about:

&amp;#x200B;

\- where to take good pictures. This is my main reason for traveling and i was hoping to get some good shots of narrow streets and nice places that are predominantly visited by locals. Of course i¬¥ll check out the usual suspects like Hagia Sophia and the market, yet sigthseeing is not that important to me. I like to see how people live outside the tourist spots.

\- where to stay. Beyoglu or Fatih? I figured Beyogul for now, since (according to google street view :D) there might be good pictures to take and its easy to switch to the other side of the golden horn and see the old town. Or would you recommend an entirely different place? (Please mind that i am not super greedy, but i prefer to find a rather inexpensive place, since i am really mostly going there to sleep.)

\- I have tried to figure out the Uber situation in Istanbul, but i get very different infos on that. I know it works in general, but apparently you can still get ripped off because drivers can choose their own routes and prices. Is that correct? Is it better just to get a regular cab? Or you would you recommend a different app like (i think its called) Bitaksi? 

\- A last one. :D I might need to get a sim card, but the offers i found so far (Vodafone, Turkcell) seem quite expensive and complicated, because you need to register and all. So i was thinking to get an eSim by Airalo.  I have never tried something like that before, so maybe someone could share their experiences in that area. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, this post has become a bit longer than expected. Sorry about that. :D Again, any kind of Info is much appreciated! Cheers!",Looking for recommendations for Istanbul (4days trip),,Boaty_McBoatface__,,1,2023-03-16 09:56:54

travel,"Good afternoon from Japan, 

Me and my best friend, whom I‚Äôve traveled with to 4 countries prior to this trip, decided to invite his friend with us along to Japan. 

In 2019 I moved from DC to California for work and had not yet met this individual before in person, the pandemic meant me and my best friend have been online for the most part thus I didn‚Äôt get the chance. 

I spent a month nearly every couple days talking to the new acquaintance. He seemed cool, same hobbies and interests as me and my best friend. So I agreed since my friend vouched for him. 

In person he‚Äôs totally awkward, socially not extroverted but my friend says he warms up and actually is pretty cool. So I‚Äôm giving it time but now it feels like our entire trip is derailed. 

On the first day he blew all of his shopping money and even dipped into food/transport money. He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand slowing down to see the different wards of Tokyo and insists on rushing to main attraction to main attraction. No time to soak it in. I‚Äôve left twice now to just have time to enjoy but my friend feels awkward leaving him to come out to drink with me so I‚Äôve done that solo, twice now. Plus, the new acquaintance doesn‚Äôt want to go to any restaurants, bars, or shops he feels are out of his budget (since he blew it day one). He keeps asking kindly to go somewhere else and my friend begrudgingly agrees to meet up after I eat. I feel like I‚Äôm traveling solo, but I also agreed to this. 

To top it off, because Japans government removed the requirement to wear masks he doesn‚Äôt. Stating it‚Äôs not required but it‚Äôs socially unacceptable in Japan. I‚Äôve talked to my best friend and he insists to give him a couple more days and if it doesn‚Äôt work he will go to a different hotel with him. I hate that it‚Äôs coming to this and wish I had a solution. I‚Äôm not stern or mean, Im worried this will dissolve my friendship of 8 years. How do I fix this and ensure I don‚Äôt alienate the new dude but set boundaries to enjoy my vacation? 

We‚Äôre in our late 20s and early 30s, I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this because I‚Äôve never experienced it.

travel," I am 29, so I am looking into the Rolling Card and Venezia Unica for the 3 full days I will be in Venice. My math is currently telling me I will be saving, but the website is so confusing that I feel like I am missing something. The few blog posts I could find about the card made it sound you wouldn't save anything with it, so I am looking for confirmation.

&amp;#x200B;

* Rolling Card and Venezia Unica I plan to get:
   * The Rolling Card plus ACTV 3 day transport - 28-euro
   * Museum Pass reduced fare that covers the 12 civic museums - 22-euro
   * Peggy Guggenheim museum - 10.50-euro
   * Total - 60.50-euro

&amp;#x200B;

* Things I plan to do (with the full prices)
   * Visit Burano and Murano - 22.5-euro in Vaporetto rides, plus 17-euro for the two museum tickets
   * Doge's Palace and Correr Museum - 25-euro combo ticket
   * Visit Giorgio Maggiore Island - 7.50-euro Vaporetto ride
   * Palazzo Mocenigo - 11-euro
   * Peggy Guggenheim museum - 17.50-euro
   * Total - 100.50-euro

&amp;#x200B;

So, if my math is right, I would save at least 40-euro, if not more if I plan to go to any other museum or go on more public transportation in those 3 days.

&amp;#x200B;

* Questions  
I am confused if I am eligible for the reduced Museum Pass with just the Rolling Card, or do I need to be a student also?
   * Same for the reduced ticket to the Peggy Gugenheim Museum?
   * How long is the museum pass good for, a specific amount of time or just one entrance per museum?

I will need to travel from Pamukkale to Izmir and arrive around 3pm. What is the most convenient way? I thought about renting a car from Denizli airport and returning it to Izmir but the one way fee alone is like $150. The hotel in pamukkale told me that I could take a little bus from Pamukkale to Denizli and then take the normal bus from there to Izmir. Do I need to book the normal bus ticket in advance? Would it be hard to find the station or the right bus?
I could also rent a car from the airport and rent it to the airport and then take the train to Izmir. Is there a train station at the DNZ airport? I can‚Äôt find it on Google map by searching train station.

travel,"My spouse and I were booked for an Air Canada flight in February that was cancelled because the plane needed maintenance (""within the airline's control, but required for safety""). We were rebooked fairly quickly on a flight leaving the next morning. At the airport, I was told by an agent that we were each entitled to $300 for accommodation ($600 total), so we booked a room in the airport hotel and got a few hours sleep before we had to leave again.

I submitted the hotel invoice for reimbursement and they just got back to me today saying that they'll e-transfer me $250 in the next few days. I replied to clarify whether it was $250 total or for each of us, since we were told we were entitled to more than double that. The reply I got says, ""I regret to inform you that the maximum reimbursement is $250.00CAD for accommodations."" The hotel was $500, so it would be covered if we both received reimbursement.

travel,"Hi 

**Intro:**

I was flying over the weekend (on a US airline), and when boarding the plane, the gate attendant was extremely confronational and rude to other passengers and us. Attendant made a confusing announcement, and when we followed as instructed , they accosted us and publicly shamed for not following their directions. 

When we tried to explain that, instructions were contradicting, attendant made further disparaging remarks and threats to refuse boarding. We wanted to take a picture of the employee badge as well as talk to the supervisor, after making several comment to the employee about their behavior.

The employee refused to show their badge, actively hid it, so we couldn't see the name, and **threatened to deboard us if we take a picture of them or their ID.** Employee also refused to call a supervisor. Other gate attendant, said that the rude employe was the supervisor.

**Question:**

I was trying to find any rules, laws, regulations regarding such behavior, but search engines results, are not helpful - I mostly found just a few similar stories, but no resolution, nor official links. I'm probably not phrasing my query correctly, or searching for the right thing.

***What I am trying to find is an advice on where to find explanation of my rights as well as obligations in situations like that, if it happens again.***

Thank you for any feedback.

P.S.:

I'm deliberatly being vague about airline name, employee, flight, and other details, as I'm just trying to find more info about rules and regulations in this case. Also, since I was unable to capture any employee details, I'm guessing, I really don't have any recourse.","Can an airline employee refuse to show/hide/obfusacte employee id/badge, while on duty?",,kinvoki,,0,2023-03-15 20:34:56

travel,"  

Hello!

I am seeking some constructive criticism from this subreddit with respect to the following itinerary. For reference, we are a married couple in our mid-thirties traveling from eastern  Canada to France and Germany in June. I am an experienced traveler, husband less so.

**Itinerary** 

Red-eye flight into Paris 

2.5 hour train ride to Lyon 

3 sleeps Lyon (possible wine tour day trip during this segment) 

2.5 hour train ride to Dijon 

1 sleep Dijon 

2.5 hour train ride to Strasbourg (probably late in the day) 

3 sleeps in Strasbourg (day trip to Colmar) 

1 hour bus to Heidelberg 

3 sleeps in Heidelberg (possibly do a biking day trip) 

Fly out of Frankfurt 

I am nervous about this itinerary as we  are covering many more kilometers than we usually do on our trips. I was confident in the itinerary until I realized how far Dijon is from Lyon.

Before I am advised to just spend the whole time in France, the context as to why I am reluctant to do that is as follows.  I have been to France 4 times in the past 5 years because I had friends living there and because my husband, who speaks French, was a reluctant traveler. Being able to talk to the locals really enhanced his experience and got him hooked on traveling. He‚Äôs now a great traveler but likes a slower pace. I can function in French, but while lack of language barrier  makes the trips very smooth, Ive spent  enough time in France recently to last me the next 10 years. Lyon remains on my husband‚Äôs bucket list and I agree it does look really beautiful . 

Id like to branch out and  do a bit of another country. If I was planning the trip solo I would spend ten -12 days just around the Rhine, Neckar, and maybe Nuremberg/Munich. 

I am wondering if the above itinerary is a good compromise or if I am just cutting the baby in half?  I realize Switzerland is closer to Lyon than Germany but I‚Äôve traveled there extensively in the past. As for Germany, I‚Äôve only done Berlin. I am really looking forward to seeing romantic storybook Germany/Alsace.

travel,"**TL;DR:**

If you have been to both cities, which did you prefer and why?

**Long version for context:**

So originally my best friend and I (both American women early/mid 40s from Los Angeles) were thinking about traveling to the UK to see Pulp. 

For a number of reasons, mostly cost and distance, decided we couldn‚Äôt make it work. We were also planning on seeing Depeche Mode in the Fall, and thought instead of seeing them here, why not make a cheaper/closer trip out of it and go somewhere else in North America to see them!

We are both well traveled, so we narrowed down to 2 places neither of us has been but would like to someday: Mexico City (concert date 9/21) or Nashville (oncert date 10/19).

**Things we are considering:**

*Cost*

Flights are around the same cost.The dollar goes far in Mexico though, so I do like the idea of being able to stay in a real nice hotel for less than $200 a night, which doesn‚Äôt look possible in Nashville.Also if we choose Nashville, my friend insists we go to Dollywood which is a 3 hour drive, making that trip longer and more costly (but I‚Äôm not against it! Would love to see that part of the country)

*Which is more ‚Äúexotic‚Äù?*

We‚Äôve both been to Mexico a bunch of times in our lives, starting from childhood having both grown up in California, just never MX city.So eventhough MX is another country and language, in a way Nashville could be a more ‚Äúexotic‚Äù location to us. We are not contemporary country fans but might be fun to go to a honky-tonk for the novelty of it.

*Food*

Again, being from LA we are no strangers to fabulous Mexican food (also btw my family is Angelino-Chicano) so Nashville has an edge here being a different type of food scene.

*Weather*

Mexico has the edge here since it‚Äôll still be warm and we can spend some time at/in a hotel pool.Nashville being a month later it will be a tad cooler and we may not be able to afford a hotel w/ pool anyway.

*Walkability/commuting*

Looks like a huge difference here, as the concert arena in Nashville is smack in the center of town, presumably where we would be staying.

The concert in MX is a half hour Uber or 45-hour train ride away from where we would presumably stay, which brings me to final consideration...

*The venue*

The concert in Nashville is at Bridgstone Arena, indoors, normally used for basketball and hockey.

The concert in MX is a ginormous outdoor field called Foro Sol, that has double the capacity Bridgstone has.We prefer outdoor, and even-though the distance from the stage may mean we can‚Äôt see the band, it may feel neat to be a part of something that big.

And IDK if this would be true, but something tells me the Mexican fans would be more pumped to see Depeche Mode vs Tennessee folks? Just thinking maybe the vibe there would be better...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway if you have been to both or either place LMK your thoughts, especially when taking my considerations into account.

Thanks in advance!",Nashville or Mexico City?,,okfine_illbite,,1,2023-03-15 20:00:10

travel,"Hey! I am planning a special trip with my husband and **3 young kids (3,5,7)** to finally visit the towns that my family came from. We are planning to go for an entire month. The **3 main areas are Campania, Sicily and Puglia** with hopefully a night in Calabria. We have already booked **June 17th- 24th in Ravello on the Amalfi coast** and will be visiting my grandparents towns in nearby Teano and Ruviano, Caserta either before or after. 

My kids are very used to traveling and we are a very adventurous crew! We love food, the water, history, all of it! We prefer a **less touristy** experience and truly like to immerse ourselves in the culture when we travel. 

I would love suggestions on: 

1. **The best way to travel with kids once in Italy**
   1. Should we rent a car the entire time? Is there a specific area we should have a car and others we shouldn't, etc. 
   2. Does taking a train make more sense between any destinations? Or flying?
2. **The most ideal starting and end points**
   1. Fly into Palermo, then driving to Puglia and finally to Amalfi?
   2. Or, fly into Bari, then drive to Palermo and take a plane to Naples?
   3. Or, something else?
3. **Puglia:**
   1. Any suggestions for the best area to stay to explore the region. We definitely want to spend a night in Matera, check out the Trullos, find the best olive oil and explore the seaside towns. 
4. **Sicily:**
   1. We were leaning towards staying in Castellammarre del Golfo and renting a car to explore Palermo and the nearby towns but very open to suggestions!

travel,"I've got an upcoming trip where I have an 11 hour layover in Amsterdam, while flying from North Africa back to the US. The problem is with the timing. I land just after 1 am on a Sunday morning and depart around Noon. I'm traveling with a carry on roller bag. I would call myself a budget traveler, but not a shoestring traveler

I think I see 3 options. 

Stay at one of the hotels in the transfer area of the airport. Certainly the easiest option, but the prices look to be $200-300 per night, which is a lot of money for what's really only a small amount of sleep. 

Try to sleep in the terminal overnight, and then move to a lounge once they open. It appears that AMS does have some relatively good relaxation areas where at least some sleep could be possible. I've slept on a terminal floor before, but obviously, it's not ideal and/or great sleep. 

Stay at an off-airport hotel. Prices seem to be more reasonable, around $100, but then involves the hassle of checking in/out of Schengen. If I go this route, how much time should I expect to need to reclear security/immigration on a Sunday morning? I've never been to Amsterdam, so is there any quick siteseeing that could be squeezed in to a short Sunday morning visit?

I have kind of an emergency that I could use some guidance on in relation to passports and what to do if one gets stolen when delivered. 

I am going on a trip next Monday to Cancun. This will be my first out of country trip and I‚Äôm really excited for it seeing as I am also going with my long time girlfriend. 

I ordered my passport for the trip in January and had it expedited so that it would arrive here on time. 

I constantly checked the process to make sure that I wouldn‚Äôt miss anything and always tried to stay in the loop of the process. 

Finally it was approved and the status information website stated that it was arriving on or around March 2nd. 

That day came and went with nothing showing up at my door or mailbox. (We live in an apartment). I waited a week longer cause I figured the government runs slow and it‚Äôll be here within the week. Well the week came and went and still nothing. 

I had a family emergency that I had to help with so I wasn‚Äôt able to focus my attention on the passport at that time, thinking that it would arrive any day. 

Fast forward to March 14th, I call the passport agency seeing as my trip is a week away and still have not received anything. Come to find out after they gave me the tracking Number for it over the phone, that it was delivered to the wrong side of my complex on March 1st and someone had in fact taken it (I had checked multiple times since March 2nd on that side). I called again to see if I can make it to a fulfillment center before my trip next week but there are no appointments open. 

I‚Äôm extremely nervous and have no idea what next step to take‚Ä¶ 

Is there anyone I can call or speak to to try and help the situation? 
I am in Wisconsin 


I know now that I should have checked on the status sooner but with this being my first I figured the government was just slow with these things.

travel,"**TL;DR is summer weather so brutal in Taiwan during the summer that it would make a seemingly really awesome trip there with a local friend suck?**

So I'm a Canadian university student who's never really done any serious traveling alone before. I have gone on some trips with my family, as my mom absolutely loves to travel, but never really more than typical family vacation fare (i.e. mexico, Dominican, USA roadtrip). However my mom loves traveling so much that she apparently started to put away a bit of money for me every month to travel somewhere when I was a baby, so I could travel somewhere while I was young without having to worry too much about finances.

One of my best friends from uni is however Taiwanese, and really really wants me to come visit and travel around Taiwan with him for a few weeks over summer vacation... We want to set up a home base in an extra apartment his dad has in Kaohsiung, and then use HSR to travel around and spend a few days in each of the major cities as well as visit some of the cool spots outside of the cities. The money I have put away should basically cover this completely too.

The only trouble is, the only time that works for us is July (or potentially May, if I manage to shift around some stuff with summer classes), and I hear it's absolutely brutally hot and always pouring rain, like everything I've read online basically just says, don't do it you will hate yourself. But I really, really want to go, as this is probably my friends last summer back home and he doesn't plan to move back after uni, and visiting there just seems so cool and everything he tells me about it just sounds awesome and I think it would be such a fun experience.

Is the weather truly that bad that it would just ruin the trip? Or are a lot of these claims slightly overblown? Worst weather in terms of heat I've experienced was a week Summer in Vegas (it was 45¬∞C and definitely hot but I managed), and the 2021 Canadian heat wave, which only got up to 35-40¬∞C for a week but we also have no AC or shade at my house.",is summer in Taiwan truly so brutal as to make it not worth it?,,whatisfoolycooly,,1,2023-03-15 10:11:53

travel,"Hey fellow travelers! I have a question for all of you amazing people. This summer I will be traveling for 12 weeks in 5 different countries. I‚Äôm so excited for this opportunity and cannot wait to explore more of the world. However, in ALL of those 12 weeks I will be with a group in one form or another. I‚Äôve traveled a bit before, and usually it‚Äôs solo, so i‚Äôm nervous how i‚Äôm going to react to being with other people for so long. I have done long trips like this before, and am confident that I can last 12 weeks, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt find time to recharge myself. Here is a breakdown of the different groups I will be with throughout the trip. 

1. South Africa / Eswatini: For the first 3 weeks I will be with a study abroad group of 11 people total. 1 of them is my brother who I am very close with.

2. Right after South Africa I am headed directly to Nepal for 4 weeks. The first 2 will be completing the ABC trek. For this portion there will be 6 people total. 1 of them being my OTHER brother who is my twin and I am very close with and the other 4 being friends of mine. 

After doing the Trek, we will be going to do some humanitarian work with local Nepali, and have been preparing projects for months. During this time, I will be with about 30 people, but most of them I won‚Äôt really know. 

3. After Nepal we are heading to India for 3 weeks, mostly Rajasthan area. For this portion I will be with the same twin brother that I spent 4 weeks with in Nepal as well as three other close friends.

4. Finally, I will be heading to the Philippines for the last two weeks with the same group that I was with in India. 

Basically: For the first 3 weeks I will be with my younger brother, and the last 9 weeks I will be with my twin brother. I am very close with both of them and am so excited, however I am terrified about the idea of going 3 months without time alone.

travel," 

I just returned from a 10 day trip in Mexico City, Queretaro, San Miguel de Allended and Guanajuato and I would like to share my experience (mostly about transportation)

**Mexico City**

Airport: landed at airport at midnight When you get to immigration, you will see a line for foreigners. However, if you are a US or Canadian citizen, you actually won't go into that line but instead go to the eletronic gates at the far end. You will be be issued a receipt after you pass through the gates and you will need to keep it with you whe you leave Mexico. The receipt will tell you to scan a QR code and fill out some online form before you leave Mexico, but at the time of this writing (March 14, 2023), this is actually not needed as the website is not really running smoothly. All you need is to keep the receipt withy ou. If you passport is brand new, you may not be able to pass throguh the electronic gates and the agents will direct you to an immigration officer, where your passport will be stamped and no receipts will be given.

Uber and taxi: Mostly took uber within the city. The only time I have taken a taxi in Mexico City was from the terminal central de norte to my hotel at Pino Suarez near the historical center. I paid for the taxi in the bus terminal (152 pesos). I only took it that one time in Mexico City as the prices for uber were actually higher at the time due to high demand.

Public transportation: You can use the Metrocard to take subway, the Metrobus, and much more. While you can pay for the individual tickets for the subway on a ride by ride basis, you will need a Metrocard to ride the Metrobus. All the information online will tell you that you can buy the cards at vending machines at subway and Metrobus stations. However, the reality is that many of the machines at subway stations are either not working or they ran out of cards. You can buy the Metrocards at the ticket window (taquilla) but you would need to speak Spanish, but even then they may have ran out of Metrocards. As for the Metrobus stations, not all stations have those vending machines.

**Teotihucan:** You can take a bus from the terminal de Central norte at Mexico City to the pyramids. I believe there is only bus company that takes you there and you can find it at gate 7/8. Although the ticket shows an assigned seat, the bus driver told us to sit anywhere on the bus. Furthermore the bus makes 3-4 stops before arriving at the pyramids, with some people ended up standing (FYI, I was told by the Lonely Planet guidebook that sometimes robberies happened on this route when the buses stopped to pick up other passesngers)

I got off at gate 1 and I caught the bus back at gate 2. My return bus was already full when it left gate 2 so it didn't go to gate 1 to pick up more passengers.

**Queretaro**: I probably won't go out of my way to visit Queretaro if its not on your way to another destination While the town center is nice, I am not sure that it justifies the travel there.

Also note that they are currently building a new highway in Queretaro so there is a lot of congestion for travel leaving Queretaro. Expect to add one extra hour of delay to your bus ride if it is leaving from Queretaro or even just passing through the outskirts of Queretaro (ex. going from Mexico City to San Miguel de Allende)

A taxi going from bus terminal to the town center should cost around 100 pesos.

**Bernal:** We visited it on a weekday and it was nice. It is more quiet but it is not dead quiet as long as you don't arrive too early. We took a 9:30 ish bus from Queretaro and arrived in Bernal at 10:45 am. We took Flecha Amarilla but I think you can also took Flecha Azul. By the time we hiked up on the monolith and came back down, the shops were open. They also have those tuktuk like taxis that you can take to the base of the monoliths for 50 pesos. To catch the bus on the way back, you will have to cross to the other side of the street where you get off. We waited for one hour at the stop before a Flecha Azul showed up

A photo of the Flecha Amarilla bus schedule at the Queretaro bus terminal is show below

https://preview.redd.it/flynwxx0ltna1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fec6e5610710cf9f5663a6e3bb47edf956099b51

**San Miguel de Allende:** The taxis right in front of the bus terminal would overcharge you. I was charged 100 pesos from the bus terminal to my hotel near Parque Benito Juarez. I later took a uber for the same trip for only 50 pesos. You can take local buses called Urbanos if you want to go from the town center to the mirador (I believe its line 8 and 9) or to the bus terminal. Each ride costs 8 pesos.

**Guanajuato:** The Guanajuato bus terminal is outside of the city. You can actually catch a local bus from the bus terminal to the town center. The stop for these local buses is right in front of the bus terminal (central). As far I know, there is only one line of bus that stop in front of the terminals. Each ride is 8 pesos. To get back to the bus terminal from the town center, you would need to catch a bus going westward on Avendia Juarez. However, check with the people in the line or with the bus driver to ensure that the bus is actually going to the bus terminal instead of someplace else.

**Wifi on public buses:** I have taken primera plus and ETN plus multiple times. I wasn't able to get actual internet access on my phone even though my phone would show that it is connected to the network.",Experience with arrival and transportation in Mexico City and central highlands.,,Bloodyhell_666,,1,2023-03-15 03:11:05

We're both in our late 20s and looking to stay for an extended weekend (Thursday-Sunday) with a budget of around $450/night (lmk if thats unrealistic). We're into sightseeing, trying new restaurants, and enjoying a mix of relaxed and party atmospheres. Ideally, we'd like to stay in a nicer area that offers a range of activities, including fun bars and pool parties, as well as fine dining, spas, and cocktail lounges for good date spots. I was thinking of either staying in Brickell (specifically the Brickell SLS) or in Miami Beach/South Beach.

I‚Äôll be going to Portugal for the first time this June, I‚Äôll be there for about 10 days. I will be in Algarve for 3-ish of those days and the remaining will be spent in Lisbon. I don‚Äôt have a say in how many days are spent in either of those places, that‚Äôs the rough itinerary for now.

With the Canadian dollars who's worth nothing in the global exchange rate and everything being overprice, it's almost impossible to plan something in advance.

travel,"Okay guys. I wanna help out everyone passing the border because this is all bullshit and I believe no one should be ripped off, especially when the money doesn't go into a community or town but straight into the pocket of a border control officer. 

So I passed the border on the Mexcio side to Belize near Chetumal today. We flew into Mexcio City at the start of the year and been travelling for 3 months. (And for anyone who isn't aware, there is a tourist tax which is included in your airline ticket)

Basically you will get scammed if you do not hold your own and be strong with the border control agents. The woman working on the border will take you into a room. Best to go in all together if travelling in a group. 

She first of all asked to see our tax receipt from our flight into Mexcio city. We showed her on our phones and she accepted it. Moments later she started to pretend not to be able to speak English. She then started to say that we needed to pay another tax due to leaving the country on land and not flying.

Can I be clear here: This is INCORRECT. 

Do not let her threatening behaviour trick you. She threatened us to not stamp our passport. This argument went on for 5 minutes or so. Then she went on saying that the airline paid for it, not us. Which is obviously total bullshit. Meanwhile a busload of people arrived so I believe we had a bit of power in this as she had probably 20+ people to get through now.
We then gave her a very stern warning that we know this is a scam and that she can scam someone else but not us. She then went on to say that she won't accept the receipt we showed her at the beginning because it wasn't a hard/ physical copy. I knew from this point she had no leg to stand on, as she is now changing the story, as she accepted the tax receipt at the start. This again went back and forth and we continued to refuse to pay the tax again. After probably 10 minutes, she then just randomly got her stamp out and slammed it down on our passport. And threw our passports at us and didn't say anything else. We actually started to laugh, because of how ridiculous it all was and how clearly this was all a scam.

When arriving at the Belize border, I got chatting to the guy behind us and he said he paid the woman at customs but then got his phone out and started taking photos/videos of her. She then gave the money back to him and stamped his passport! Side note: The Belize border is very easy, with zero issues. All the staff were super nice!

After talking to the taxi driver we had, he said that this woman will take the money you give her and then pay off certain bus companies/taxis that tell the tourists that they must pay the tax and they also get a cut from all this bullshit too. 

I think if we hadn't been super strong we might have paid it (mostly because we were arguing for around 15 minutes). So please don't fall for this tourist trap. I loved my time in Mexico but this left such a sour taste in my mouth. I'm sick of locals but particularly people in 'higher power' thinking you can just rip someone off just because we are a visitor to their country. 

The taxi driver we had was also amazing. It was $50USD to get from Bacalar to San Ignacio! If you need his number message me, as I've heard some tacos drivers ask for $150 USD.

travel,"So, this is a little odd situation and I will try to make it as simple as I can. 

People involved

Myself: A Korean national with Korean passport and a US permanent resident

My daughter &amp; wife: Both US citizens with US passports, daughter is a toddler.

My mom: A Korean national with Korean passport and does not have green card or visa, just a traveler. 

So, my wife, myself, and my daughter are going to take a road trip from Idaho where we live to Vancouver, BC. We are flying in late May from Vancouver, BC to Seoul on a direct flight via Korean Air. We are moving (back) to Seattle once we return to the States in July (Only gone for 5 weeks on a trip) so I was planning on driving my truck myself to Seattle, store it at my buddy's house there, fly back to Boise then the family is going to take a road trip to Vancouver BC in her car, park at long term at Vancouver Airport for those 5 weeks. 

When we come back, my mom is coming with us. To help us move and spend a little more time with my daughter, she will stay with us at our new place in Seattle for a couple month when we return in July. As a Korean national, she can visit the US with ESTA that allows her to stay for 90 days. 

The problem is this. We are flying back into Vancouver, then we are driving through Peace Arch to return to the US by car. For our family, it's no big deal because I am a permanent resident and they are US citizens. Now, for my mom, who's not a citizen or PR in the US or Canada, I am not sure how that goes. She also can visit Canada for 90 days without a visa, but technically she will only be in Canada for maybe 6 hours before we hit the border. At that point, she will be entering the US by car and I guess she will be going through the same procedure as if she landed in SeaTac Airport. 

Our concerns are these. USCBP does not like when they see if a non citizen is visiting a family in the US with citizenships and PRs, as I have heard. Us all being in a car together, would that cause a problem for her? USCBP would soon find out we are all family but she's the only one without a green card or citizenship. Though her purpose of visit is bona fide and she has no intention to overstay whatsoever. 

Second, she will be flying out of Seattle in September, instead of flying out of Vancouver again. Would she be questioned by the immigration in Canada when she enter? All she's really doing in Canada would be using it as a place to exit out of Canada to go to the US. 

If any advice can be given, I'd be forever grateful. Otherwise, I might have to have her fly in to SeaTac next day or something and pick her up from there. It's just she can't speak much English and she is in her 60s so I'd like to help her out when she's entering the country and whatnot.","A little complicated itinerary, needs advice",,welldressedpepe,,0,2023-03-15 00:30:56

Where I get lost is during my layover from Point B to Point C, I have to switch airlines, which I've never had a problem with, but I've never had to check a bag before.  Will I have to go pick it up, then go through security again?  I have a 4 hour layover, so I just want to make sure I make the most of my time and am not taking any unnecessary steps.

travel,"for context, puerto escondido is considered a ""cash town"" and based on the research i've done online, the area i'm staying in (La Punta) doesn't have a reliable ATM. and the puerto escondido airport only has one ATM, so it was recommended to not bank (no pun intended) on that one working. we also have to pay for the hostel in pesos, so i'm taking out more cash than i typically would.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm trying to come up with a plan for arriving in Puerto Escondido with cash. Either way - I ordered currency from my bank, so I have about half of what I need with that\*. The other half, I have a few options:

1. Go to currency exchange in the US before my flight (5.7% exchange rate + exchange fee = $20)
2. Go to ATM during my layover in Mexico (?? exchange rate + ?? mexico ATM fee + home bank foreign ATM fee = ??? + $3)

So what I'm hoping someone can tell me is:

1. Is it worth the risk of saving some money (and maybe not even that much)?
2. Is it worth assuming that the exchange rate would be better in Mexico?
3. If yes to the above, which bank ATMs in Mexico are safe/trustworthy/reliable?

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any insights!!!

&amp;#x200B;

travel," ZUG, SWITZERLAND ‚Äì UK based web3 company, **Triend**, implements a new standard for travel reviews on the consortium Camino blockchain facilitated by **Chain4Travel**. This new development will enable more transparent and secure reviews, addressing some of the major problems presented by current review systems.

Triend provides a new global decentralised review standard based on trust, personalisation and ownership with the aim to reshape reviews for customers and businesses globally.

This new blockchain-based system allows for a more transparent, secure, and trustworthy evaluation of products and services. Triend transforms reviews into digital assets, that are owned and governed by users which creates a new, trusted standard by decentralised ownership. The decentralised nature is one of the key benefits of web3 reviews. The reviewer is identified as the owner of the asset which results in greater transparency and accountability. This new approach also incentivises users to post reviews by rewarding them with token-based payments, promoting greater transparency and authenticity. By posting reviews and interacting with other users, reviewers can also earn points that can be redeemed for rewards.

In the end of April (22-24ish) I'll be taking a train from Paris to London.

Does anyone can recommend of such places that have some nice views and trails around them and are easily accessible by train/bus?

I have a vision of a bag that is just big enough to hold everything I need, not be a backpack-only style ( so sling or large fanny pack that i can wear across the front), and has a water bottle holder rather than carrying a second sling for WB. I need just enough room for day-walking essentials, plus a small scarf or dress to cover up when going in churches and such. I'd also love if it didn't look horribly touristy (points for cute + stylish)

Maybe stop somewhere on the way to

Bologna for the night

Florence 5-6 days (Florentine new year maybe) explore Tuscany here via car

Rome 3-4 days (never been)

Naples a few days

There are several threads covering this topic already, but they all seem very inconclusive, with a mixture of ""Yes""s, ""No""s, ""Maybe""s, and ""Yes, but they'll never check""s. So I'm probably just creating another inconclusive thread, but I'd be interested in hearing some more opinions.

I'm not too worried about cost, but a lot of the options look like outright scams, with the allegedly popular Europ Assistant having a devestating 98% 1-star reviews on Trustpilot, which is bad even for the already inherently very scammy insurance industry.

travel," 

Seeking a travel companion, male or female, for an upcoming cultural and restful vacation in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As a male in my 30s, I have been to the region many times and have taken friends before. I previously trained in theology and am currently studying computer science.

I am looking for someone to join me and share in the adventure of exploring the region's rich history and religious significance, experiencing the renowned food scene, and enjoying activities. I'm looking for someone who hasn't been to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem before, as I want to share my love for these cities with someone who can experience them for the first time with fresh eyes. So if you haven't been before, please apply!

As I will be traveling with mild mental health challenges, I am seeking a patient kind individual who can provide some support with administrative responsibilities such as checking in and out of hotels, and help alleviate any stress.

To be successful in this role, I am looking for someone who possesses the following qualities:

&amp;#x200B;

* I am Christian but it is not a requirement
* An adventurous and risk-taking attitude
* Good interpersonal skills
* Adaptability to various situations and people from diverse backgrounds and cultures
* The ability to handle unexpected situations calmly and efficiently
* Strong problem-solving and decision-making skills
* Willingness to share accommodation with me and at least one other person. This will include your own key etc

During our stay in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, we will have the opportunity to explore and enjoy the following:

* Tel Aviv's beautiful beaches, vibrant nightlife, and stunning Bauhaus architecture
* Jerusalem's rich history and religious significance, including sites such as the Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
* Israel's renowned food scene, including traditional Middle Eastern cuisine, street food, and modern culinary offerings
* Local markets and shops, where you can find unique souvenirs, artisanal products, and locally made goods
* Art galleries, museums, and cultural events, showcasing Israel's rich artistic and cultural heritage
* Outdoor activities, such as hiking, biking, and exploring the country's natural beauty
* The opportunity to meet and interact with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, learn about their traditions and customs, and gain a deeper understanding of the region's complexities and challenges.

All expenses including food, drink, flight, and travel insurance will be covered. The vacation will be between 10 days and possibly over 14, around mid-April.

If you possess the above-mentioned qualities and are interested in joining me on this exciting adventure, please apply at the following URL: [**https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3523513914/**](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3523513914/). I am also happy to meet you beforehand to connect, or we can connect over webcam or ideally both. Please note the above link is a formalised version of this post, since its LinkedIn and not advertised at a specific group, but this post trumps that one.

Feel free to add any questions to this post, but please keep it positive and constructive, if it isn't for you. As mentioned I will happily meet the person and their friends before hand (or whatever you suggest) to give due assurances ! It can be quite stressful trying to bless somebody, it turns out!

I (US citizen) would like to take my grandma (Honduran citizen with a US residency/green card) on an international trip. She is in her mid-70s, and has cancer that is unfortunately spreading. She is also slightly obese, with bad knees that need surgery.  It has been her lifelong dream to go to Paris, and Istanbul is a close second. I currently have the time (in between jobs) and money (a couple of thousand USD saved) to take her on either trip, but due to her health and physical condition, I can't think of an easy way to plan a meaningful trip. Having gone to both cities myself in the past, I know that it isn't easy navigating the streets in a wheelchair, and that a walker or cane would be better, however, even with a walker or cane, I suspect she would still have to frequently stop for breaks (i have heard that there may be knee injections she can get right before the trip, to perhaps help with this). Stairs are also incredibly difficult for her, so all lodgins and attractions without elevators would not be an option. Of course, issues of transportation and movement are in addition to the fact that I am not fluent in French or Turkish, so in addition to finding a way to get her from the airport to the city selected, and to the sites within and without the city, I'd have to also manage the normal difficulties of doing my best to communicate in another language, without becoming the ugly American, while also being mindful of her health and needs (it's a trip for her, after all).
     Has anyone done something similar in the past? What can I do to make a trip like this possible and meaningful for her, that is within my means financially and practically? Is a collapsible walker a viable option, in tandem with frequent Ubers? I'm just concerned that so much time, effort, and money will go into this trip, and she may end up spending most of her time in the hotel, being unable to move. The logistics of the airport to the hotel, hotel to our daily sites, finding an area for her to rest or use the bathroom when needed, etc., seem so daunting! This is something I'd like to do this year, ideally within the next few months (before a new job precludes me from traveling, or her condition worsens).

travel,"Hey all, will be traveling for a few months and need to sort out converters and adapters. I'm not sure what countries (or does it go by product type) require converters. I'm using standard US plugs and devices.

**What I'll need to plug in -** 

Laptop, iPhone charger, other usb charging devices - extra laptop monitor, Amazon kindle, that's about it. No hair curlers or anything like that, just rechargeable tech devices.

**Countries I'll be visiting** \- (mostly Europe, but I think it varies country to country here anyway.)

Then a non-Euro side trip to Egypt, South Africa, slight chance of Morocco

Day 8: Explore Edinburgh, Musselburgh golf course (optional), catch late train to London

travel,"Hello wonderful reddit travelers, you guys have been so helpful and I‚Äôd be grateful for a little more advice. 

I‚Äôll be spending a week in Scotland with 2 other people this spring. One in our party is disabled and gets tired easily so we aren‚Äôt planning much besides relaxing and just enjoying being in another country. We would love to see some castles and maybe the Highlands. We‚Äôre staying in Edinburgh. 

The obvious choice for me is to rent a car but, looking into car rentals in Edinburgh is confusing! I see you can rent actual people‚Äôs cars! I‚Äôm from the US. Do they have any sort of Zip car there, like a one day rental? I doubt we‚Äôll go further than 2-3hrs from Edinburgh. 

Tour busses are out as they are difficult to access and we can‚Äôt commit to an itinerary. 

Can you guys drop some recommendations on how to rent and who to go with? I‚Äôm weary to go through sites like Priceline but I will if everyone has had good experiences!

travel,"My mother is 87 years old and wants to take an international trip to Brazil later this year. It was originally going to be her, my father, and my girlfriend. To give some background I'm 31, and adopted (yes my parents adopted at an older age). I was adopted at birth, and this trip is to see my extended family in Brazil. 

She has multiple health issues. She heavily relies on a wheelchair the majority of her days, and occasionally will use a walker. She has rheumatoid arthritis. She has hearing issues, and won't get hearing aids so you almost have to yell for her to hear you. Her memory is starting to go (not knowing what day of the week it is/just being forgetful). And she is starting to make irrational decisions. 

On top of all this she has become very difficult to be around. Starting at the beginning of the year she was extremely upset with my father, then she became extremely upset with my godfather a month later. It's generally not a joy to be around her anymore. And part of it is that she is just getting older, and isn't happy with her life. 

I want to tell her that she can't go on the trip, and that I think my girlfriend and I should just go. My father already has said he doesn't want to go so he's staying home. My mom cannot physically go without me so I have the power to tell her she can't go. Am I in the wrong for this? I don't think the trip will be nearly as enjoyable if she goes. She already stresses me out daily with all that she does at her age and in her condition. She frequently disregards her health to do what she wants. And being on a trip with her for 2 weeks doesn't sound like a great time.

travel,"Hi all!

I went back and searched some previous threads for our particular questions, but I couldn't quite find the answers I was looking for despite the popular topic...

My wife and I are planning a 12 day trip to the region in September. Wanted to get a little feedback on general pacing of our trip (especially Switzerland portion), as we're trying to figure out appropriate amounts of time to allot to different areas.

Day 1-2 - arrival in Munich, spend the night and hit Oktoberfest celebration, train to Salzburg on evening of second day

Day 2-4 - late arrival in Salzburg, Sound of Music bike tour and general sightseeing day 3 and early day 4, then train to Innsbruck

Day 4-5 - arrive in Innsbruck, spend the day looking around town (mostly designed to break up travel a bit, no real to-do items here)

Day 5 - take off from Innsbruck, this is where itinerary starts to get a bit cloudy...

We initially planned to take train to Chur from Innsbruck, then look into Glacier Express to Zermatt. Based on some comments here, we may opt to head as far as Innsbruck-Andermatt and use general trains vs GE. We plan to spend most of our time in the Interlaken/Murren/Lauterbrunnen area for 3-4 days, so we want to figure out if it's worth trying to hit Zermatt, see the Matterhorn, and tool around the area for the day, or if it would just be better and/or easier to just skip out on Zermatt and go straight to the middle of the country. Any thoughts on if Zermatt is worth it as a non-ski destination that time of year and if travel would take up too much of our time if we did try to head that way?

*Camogli
*Florence
*Venice
*Turin
*Parma‚Ä¶

travel,"Hey All,

In the middle of planning a month-long trip to Europe in May and have already decided to spend a week each in Scotland (based in Edinburgh but will do a 3 night Whisky tour of Islay), Germany (Munich &amp; Berlin) and Turkey (8 day tour).

I have a week left and trying to decide between flying into Stockholm for a couple of nights before training to Copenhagen for 4 nights then onto Germany, or flying into Sarajevo from Germany and then busing to Belgrade for a couple of nights before flying onto Turkey.

I know it's like choosing between apples and oranges, or your favourite child, but I'm still having a hard time deciding what option to pick! I will be travelling solo (male, early 40's) and enjoy a good mix of exploring cities, doing day trips, learning about history and culture and good food and drink.

I'm really into craft beer too so Copenhagen seems like the best choice for food and drinking (although will be super expensive) but have been reading a lot of good things about the friendly people, interesting history and nice scenery in Bosnia / Serbia.

Anyone been to both combos of cities before and can help sway me one way or the other? !!",Stockholm &amp; Copenhagen vs Sarajevo &amp; Belgrade,,brett174,,3,2023-03-13 01:07:24

So please feel free to be very specific and treat me like an 8th grader who knows nothing.** I have also posted this in r/Cruise

We will be cruising NCL Breakaway in December with a family of 8 and two balcony staterooms. We have an age range of 10yrs - 66yrs(with fleeting dementia) and want to balance activity and relaxation during our trip.

Our ports from/to New Orleans include: (highlights of each port that are a must are noted by each)

Cozumel, MX - Ruins
Roatan, Bay Islands, Honduras - Sloth Picture
Harvest Caye, Belize
Costa Maya, MX

Cozumel- I'm open to ideas to maximize experience, but was thinking of doing an excursion (3rd party) on Cozumel to see Tequila/Mezcal, Chocolate, and ruins all-in-one. Which ruins on the islands are worth it? I'd LOVE to go to Chichen Itza (life bucket list item - I'm the history buff of the group), but it would take up the entire day and wouldn't allow for long enough at the site. So, the ruins excursion on Cozumel will be my one chance to see my first (hopefully not last, but never know) Mayan ruins.

Roatan - My daughter, niece and Sister-In-Law would murder me if we didn't hold a sloth.

Multiple ports - At some point I'd like to snorkel the barrier reef since it is the most vibrant of all remaining reefs. My thoughts pattern is that we never know how much longer we have before it's gone, so this could be time-sensitive.

Side question - Are any day passes to resorts worth it? If so, where and which ones?


Anyone have links or recommendations to good excursions that would include pick up from the pier or walking distance from the pier and include all of the main points above? Bonus points for extra inclusions.

I have traveled a lot internationally and my Spanish is alright, but nothing to write home about. I have never planned a trip like this before, so I'm not really sure where to start. 

I will be going with my girlfriend, and we hope to do a good mix of nature and cultural stuff in - we're both Californians, so we don't need more than a few days of beach time. Our budget for plane tickets will be about $2.5k, and $2-3k budget for everything else (is this realistic? Should I rebalance this?). We are both avid hikers, and in generally good shape. We're also hoping to avoid touristy stuff for the most part, we are not the resort-type travelers. I am immune compromised, so I can't drink the tap water in most developing countries; as long as I can buy bottled water, I'm alright. For the same reason, I have a fairly tight window between my medication doses - June 30 to July 25th - for the trip to actually happen. 

We have been looking at Costa Rica, but are totally open to other ideas. I'm also not asking for someone to plan my trip for me - I'd just like some guidance so I can figure out how to do it in the future.

\- How do you approach planning a trip like this?

Not sure if this is allowed here, but I'm going to try my luck and ask away. Long story short, last month I've been on a trip to Warsaw, Poland, by plane (with Wizz Air), with departure from Budapest. I had a checked in luggage with me, and I wanted to bring back some drinks (all of which were canned). I put them all in the checked in luggage, with some clothing, I dropped it off and that was it. When I arrived in Budapest and opened my luggage, I noticed that one of the cans had a small cut on the side and basically my entire luggage was soaked. I didn't pay much attention to it at first, but I inspected it a bit closer when I got home and I noticed there was no sharp edge inside the luggage, which could've caused that cut.

Is it possible that they opened my luggage in the airport for extra security reasons? It was my first time flying, so I'm not sure whether they're allowed to do that. I tried looking up on Google but I couldn't really find much info

travel,"I recently accepted a new job (yay!) and am taking April off between jobs. I decided that I want to visit Southeast Asia, but am having trouble deciding where to go. I took a course on Performance in Southeast Asia and college and remember that Vietnam, Singapore and Malaysia were standouts. But since it's my first trip to the region, it feels wrong to not go to Thailand. 

I'm torn between these two itineraries: 

Thailand-Laos-Vietnam OR Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore

I've seen recommendations to stick to just two countries, but if I were to do three then I'd likely spend 3-4 days in Laos/Singapore and then divide the rest of the time between the other two. 

Other info:

Budget: 3-5K (could go up to 7K, but that seems excessive)  

Lodging: Planning on mostly hostels and a hotel towards the end of the trip

Flights: Probably flying out of JFK/EWR, but could go to SF before leaving and fly out of SFO. Return trip to JFK/EWR. Flying out of SFO doesn't seem like it'll save that much time or money with the trip being so close. But I would get to see some old friends! 

Interests: theatre, music, dance, FOOD, hiking/nature

Goals for this trip: meeting other travelers (haven't been on a true solo trip since 2018), snorkeling or learning to scuba dive, indulging in some luxury, attend a music/dance/theatre performance, do a little bit of partying

Which itinerary do you recommend? Should I consider other places based on my interests / goals? Is there any benefit to flying out of SFO other than seeing my friends? Do I really need to narrow the list down to just two places? Should I pick one place and spend the whole month there instead?

It's been harder than I expected to find concrete information on legality after 12 weeks.

travel,"I spent 5 days in Alona Beach in March 2022, mainly scuba diving and snorkeling. The beaches and diving are fantastic, but you need to navigate Philippine infrastructure and amenities. Here are all the tips and tricks I wish I could have found on reddit before I left.

**- General tips -**

**Getting from the airport to a hotel** in Alona beach by trike (tuktuk) should cost 150-250 depending on your negotiating. The ‚Äútrike mafia‚Äù immediately at the airport exit will be hard to negotiate with. You can get better pricing by leaving the airport and walking to the main street where you can hail a ride. The vendors at the airport exit asked for 600 pesos for a van ride, but they will be ok with 500 if you offer it.

**Safety.** I felt very safe here even late at night. Pickpocketing and other petty crime just didn‚Äôt seem very common. I met a number of single female backpackers here. You may get overcharged for services frequently if you don‚Äôt negotiate, but that‚Äôs the only kind of robbery you‚Äôll need to worry about.

**Where to stay.** If you‚Äôre looking to save money, you can get a hostel bed for 1,000 pesos. I highly recommend Nautilus Hostel and Hammock which also has private rooms with A/C. If you‚Äôre looking to splurge, Henan and Amorita are the nicest resorts in the area imho. You won‚Äôt find a true 5 star level of service or amenities here, but you get decent value relative to what you would pay for these amenities elsewhere. Henan has a Carribean large resort vibe. Amorita is more secluded and attempts to be a bit more upscale but they‚Äôre about the same. Amorita is better for a honeymoon and Henan is better for families.

**When to go.** The weather was fantastic in March. It was the beginning of dry season and it wasn‚Äôt cloudy once during the 5 days I spent there. The breeze was cool enough that I never felt really hot. Locals also said March was a great month in general.

**Laundry**. If you‚Äôre staying a while and need to do some laundry, there are a number of drop off laundry stations in the area that cost 40-60 pesos per kg. If you have a lot, there‚Äôs one that offers a flat rate of 399 for up to 8 kg.

**Beach.** The beach is gorgeous everywhere, but the beach in front of Henan is public and little less swarmed by vendors so if you‚Äôre not staying at Henan, you can still slide over there for a better experience and enjoy the music from their pool bar.

**- Snorkeling -**

**tldr**: the snorkeling is fantastic but vendors will nickel and dime you if you let them.

Everywhere you walk in Alona, people will offer you ‚Äúisland hopping‚Äù or sightseeing tours. They‚Äôll usually have a laminated card with prices they‚Äôll show you.

The typical package includes **‚Äúdolphin watching‚Äù, Balicasag Island, and Virgin Island**. You‚Äôll get picked up around 6 or 630am and head to a beach where you‚Äôll board a small motorboat with 5-15 other people (if you don‚Äôt book your own private boat). The motor can be very loud and I actually wish I brought earplugs. They‚Äôll take you to an area where they may be dolphins, but honestly I think there‚Äôs a low chance you actually get to see anything. This is just included in the itinerary to make you feel like you‚Äôre getting something extra.

They‚Äôll then take you to **Balicasag** where you will get a snorkel and fins (make sure to ask for them if they‚Äôre not given to you). They‚Äôll ask you if you want to preorder any food for later but the prices are heavily inflated ‚Äì bring snacks if you think you might get hungry before noon. You‚Äôll be split up into smaller groups of 2-4 and board small rowboats where someone will take you a bit offshore to snorkel. The reef here really was gorgeous with a lot of marine life. It did not disappoint. You get about 30 minutes snorkeling. You then go to an area where they may be sea turtles. There were a few when I went and they were impressive. You also get about 30 minutes there. You then eat on Balicasag if you ordered food and transfer back onto the motorboat.

The last stop is a beautiful sand bank at **Virgin Island**. You get out and walk around and take pictures. Before you get out, the driver may ask you for an additional ‚Äúenvironmental fee‚Äù even if you prepaid. You may need to argue if you don‚Äôt want to pay the additional 100 or 150 pesos. Keep your original booking paperwork to support your case. I ended up not having to pay after being stubborn for 5 minutes. You get about 30 minutes to walk around and take photos and then head back to Alona Beach.

**Negotiating** the price. The laminated cards that people will show you quote 1500 pesos which includes a 300 environmental fee. You can negotiate this. After I rejected one vendor, another offered me 1200, which I took but you might be able to get it lower. After I was picked up and about to board the boat, the vendor said there will be a 250 pesos additional environmental fee at Balicasag. Nobody asked me for a fee at Balicasag but the boat captain asked me for 100 at Virigin Island. So it was pretty clear they just try to get you to double pay the environmental fee. I‚Äôve also heard you can get a trip to Balicasag only for 750. I‚Äôd probably do that if you just want to snorkel, although Virgin Island was beautiful.

**Other options.** An easy and cheap alternative to the island hopping package is to take a tukuk to **Napaling reef** to the north. It should cost about \~150 pesos to get there. If you need to rend a mask and fins, that‚Äôs another \~150 pesos. There is no beach, but you take stairs in the cliff down to the water and the snorkeling is very good. You can also join a scuba boat to Balicasag to snorkel around the boat but you‚Äôll be in deeper waters and unlikely to see too much. But a benefit is that the boat will be nice and you‚Äôll get lunch and you‚Äôll be away from the hordes of tourists at Balicasag beach.

**- SCUBA -**

**tldr:** if you‚Äôre not an experienced diver, refresh your knowledge of how to **check your gear** before each dive. The rental gear is not well maintained even at the best shops. The o-ring on my tank ruptured at 15m about halfway through one of my dives. The diving lives up to its reputation ‚Äì fantastic diving with a variety of sealife including large turtles, baracuda, and some sites with great macro diving.

I booked a refresher and a few days of fun dives at **Bohol Divers Club** based on their google reviews and personal recommendations. They‚Äôre unique for having several European dive masters. And all of the dive masters seemed competent.

The **refresher cost 1,500** pesos and includes everything (except a dive computer). I‚Äôd recommend renting a dive computer to refresh yourself on that also. It included one shallow dive with exercises (purge water from mask etc) and one deeper dive to \~15m. It was enough to get you warmed up again after time off.

A day of **3 fun dives cost 5,350** with all equipment except a dive computer. The dive computer was an extra 500 per day. On most of my dives the dive masters were locals and we had one dive master per 2-4 divers. The more experienced divers would request specific dive masters. The dive masters prepare your gear and dive with you, showing you the best spots, etc.  

The diving was fantastic. It really lives up to its reputation. Balicasag in particular was teeming with sealife including large turtles, baracuda, cardinal fish, batfish, lion fish, and ghost pipefish. The dive site called Rudy‚Äôs Rock at Balicasag was particularly good. Other locations away from Balicasag had great macro diving.

**Check your gear.** On the second dive of the day at Balicasag I was down about 15m halfway through the dive and I heard a loud noise behind me but wasn‚Äôt sure what it was. I checked my pressure and it was falling quickly. Fortunately, my dive master was nearby, noticed, and came over, gave me his secondary regulator and shut off my tank. He sent the other people in my group with another dive master and we did a slow ascent with the normal 3 minute decompression stop. I was able to stay relatively calm and we made it up. We surfaced a few hundred meters from our boat and it took about 15 minutes of floating towards the boat for it to see us ‚Äì which was not ideal. I‚Äôm not sure how much air he had in his tank at the end. We examined the tank and confirmed the oring ripped.

It worked out fine but it was a dangerous situation. If this has happened near the end of the dive when our air supplies were lower or I had not been able to get someone‚Äôs attention, it would have been more dicey. One dive master mentioned offhand how the Philippines is not a place where you want to have barotrauma (from holding your breath while ascending) given the quality of the healthcare system.

During my first day, my rental watershoes were extremely worn to the point of almost being unwearable. I should have taken that as my signal to be very detail oriented with my pre-dive checks. Equipment is just not maintained that well here. And you can‚Äôt rely on your dive masters to check it. On another dive, my tank wasn‚Äôt tight in the BCD and slid out. You might want to prep your gear yourself and switch your own tanks.","Trip Report - Alona Beach, Panglao, Philippines - scuba and snorkeling",,Overalls88,,1,2023-03-12 10:57:41

I‚Äôm planning a trip to Singapore and Malaysia (and Dubai) in May, I wanted to get your feedbacks and advices for this king of trip, especially for the island to go on in Malaysia.

¬†

Little bit of context, to understand why Dubai. I‚Äôm French and I will go from Lyon‚Äôs airport, from this airport, Emirates is a good choice, and all the planes make a stop at Dubai (to go to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur), so why not planning something like 2 days in Dubai to quickly visit this place (as the price are not very different, except hotels‚Ä¶), see skyscrapers and maybe deserts and mosques‚Ä¶

I will not travel for long time, only 12-14 days, so I will not do a lot of different places, I prefer to do correctly few places than to see lot of different city briefly ‚Ä¶

After some research, I did this plan:

(all dates are on May) 

9 to 11 : Singapore

11 to 14: Perhentian islands (or other, I see Redhang and Tioman, what are your thought on this?). I have seen on the sub and on the internet that it is may is not the good season for Langkawi.. 

15 to 19: Kuala Lumpur (with maybe a day at Cameron Islands or to another destination)

20 to 22: Dubai

What are your thoughts on this plan? Any advice? Specifically on transportation between Singapore and Perhentian (or other islands) ?

 **HISTORY**

&amp;#x200B;

 The first medieval city centre of Medina del Campo was founded around the 11th century on the **hill** (**mota** in Spanish), where nowadays is the castle. The **repopulation** of the town and the **trade activity** made the inhabitants move closer to the river to establish themselves and leave the fortified hill. King Juan II of Castile, his children king Enrique IV and queen Isabella ‚Äúthe Catholic‚Äù and her husband Fernando ‚Äúthe Catholic‚Äù built the Castle of La Mota in the **15th century**.

&amp;#x200B;

 It¬¥s one of the biggest castles in Castile. It was used as fortress and was at one time a strategic **military centre**. The keep (the largest tower of the castle) contained part of the **archives** of the crown during the reigns of Enrique IV and Juana I and also it was used as a **prison** of the state, where Cesare Borgia and Hernando Pizarro were imprisoned.

&amp;#x200B;

 

The castle has a trapezoid floor plan. It‚Äôs made up of two great walls ‚Äì one **outside** (barbican, full of underground **shooting galleries**) and one **inside**\- and a wide parade ground. The coat of arms of the **Catholic Monarchs** of the year 1483 is visible above the arch of the main gate. The keep is 130ft high (more than 40m). The **chapel** of Santa Maria del Castillo is on the ground floor. Inside, there are interesting works of art such as the Hispano-Flemish **triptych** and a beautiful ivory crucifix of the 17th century. A large-scale copy of a **map of 1500**, by Juan de la Cosa, can be seen in another room.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Some important renovation and **reconstruction works** were done during the first half of the 20th century to make the castle look like new. In 1942, during Franco¬¥s dictatorship, it was used as a **training school** for the Feminine Section and since 1984 it has been under the control of the **Autonomous Community of** ***Castilla y Le√≥n*** (the regional government).

travel,"In August I will be going to Japan and South Korea with one other person, mainly Japan (3 weeks), and Korea (1 week) because I'm already close by. I'll be flying from Toronto, Canada.

I just wanted some advice if there is a better plan or if this is solid enough, this is my first time planning a trip, so I'm quite unsure about my plans.

One thing I'm scared about is all the one-ways, I've heard that going into Japan with one-ways could become a problem. I'm very anxious about this part, if I show them all my one ways from Toronto-Tokyo, then Tokyo-Seoul and Seoul-Toronto, will I run into any issues? Although it seems like if you show them proof of onward travel everything should be fine. Do you guys know if some people have still run into issues getting into Japan even once showing proof of onward travel? Also, would being from Canada help with any of these issues?

Still seeing if I'll be going to Narita or Haneda. Also, should 1hr and 30min layovers especially in populated USA cities be avoided? I've avoided those from my plans as it seems like if there are delays you could miss the other flight.

My flight plan:

* Toronto (YYZ) to Tokyo - roughly $750
* Tokyo to Seoul (ICN) - roughly $150-200 + luggage fees?
* Seoul (ICN) to Toronto (YYZ) - roughly $1200 but will be using points for this flight

From all my research this is the best possible route I could take, as it's relatively the cheapest and gives the least headache. It seems like one-ways could cause fewer headaches than two round trips, especially with luggage pick-up and drop-offs. From my understanding, if you do two round trips you would then have to pick up your luggage (in this case from your Seoul-Tokyo flight) and then go check it in again (for the Tokyo-Toronto flight) and it seems like if there were any delays or such it could be a mess. 

I've heard that there are tickets where all the flights are on one ticket and they will take care of the luggages, especially with the Seoul-Tokyo and then Tokyo-Toronto flight period, is that true? If it were true, I'd assume that ticket might be way more expensive, but if it could clear any problems I'm scared about with one-ways into Japan as mentioned above, I might consider it. \*Although I'd somehow need the last flight to be Air Canada and be able to pay through them as I'm using their points. And if I'm just overthinking it with the one-ways into Japan then I guess everything should be fine. 

If I'm wrong about the last two paragraphs above (or anything in general), please correct me

I've concluded that flying into Korea at all costs is not worth it, as flying into Japan is roughly $500 cheaper, and the flight to get out of both countries is roughly the same (around $1200) so flying out of Korea is the best option.

When flying from Tokyo to Seoul would they have spots saved but you obviously have to pay for them, with luggages as it seems like that's not included in the price, and there might be a chance I bring another checked luggage for a total of three, for two people.

travel,"Hi, we are visiting Victoria Falls, flying into VFA on the Zimbabwe side.  We are interested in walking over the bridge to visit the Zambia side (then returning to Zimbabwe) and our question is about the visa situation.  Our nationality is USA.

I understand that if we fly into VFA, cross to Zambia and cross back, we would need a multi-entry visa for Zimbabwe.  We would also need a Zambia visa.  But I have also read about the ""KAZA UNIVISA"" which supposedly covers both countries and may save us some money.  Some places seem to say the KAZA visa is available at VFA airport, but others say it is available only at land borders.  If it is available at the airport do we just ask at the visa desk for the ""KAZA"" visa and they will know what we are talking about?  Or is this something we should apply for online in advance?

travel,"Hey all...sort of a vent, but also maybe some advice?

I'm at the start of a 4.5 month solo trip through Europe and the UK. I've been in Portugal for a little over a week. I had 3 nights in Lisbon and then 4 nights in Porto. I'm back in Lisbon now, but leaving soon.

What I'm finding is that I already don't really care to visit or see anything. I spent my first week wandering city streets, and visiting various attractions, free and paid. I saw 3 cathedrals, and honestly, kind of over them. I had a friend before I left, an older man who has travelled a lot, tell me ""once you've seen one cathedral, you've seen them all"". I laughed him off at the time, but I think he might be right? 

I guess where I'm coming from is that it seems to get a bit... repetitive. I've walked up and down so many streets and alleys, and other than the graffiti, it's all kind of the same. The churches are vast and sweeping. The alleys are narrow and quaint. The people are legion.

Part of it definitely is that I'm not really a city person. I live in a relatively small city (90,000), and when I go out it's usually to go for a hike somewhere out of town. I would eventually like to move somewhere with even less people. The best day I think I've had on this trip so far is when I splurged on a tour to a park an hour away from Porto and spent most of the day walking a river valley.

I'm not at all thinking of ending my trip. Regardless of these musings, I'm still having a great time and grateful to be here. I am however thinking of changing up my original plan of hopping between major cities, and maybe just camping out in smaller towns for 1-2 weeks at a time. I'm having a hard time getting my brain into that plan, as part of me is still pushing that I should be hitting all the famous cities and sites to get the most out of this.

I guess I'm just curious if other people have experienced these feelings of sightseeing overload? Is it maybe exacerbated by not having a partner to marvel at the sights with? Has anyone travelled avoiding major cities and just spent time in smaller towns, and was it still a worthwhile travel experience for you?

I'm only in Lisbon for 2 nights and then heading to Faro where I've booked a few nights at a hostel on the beach, outside of town. Going to camp out,  take some time to think this through and try and figure out exactly what it is I'm hoping to gain from this and how best to go about it.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I guess it was more vent than anything. I'd do it in my journal but I'm really curious to know if others feel similarly.",Sightseeing burnout,,goatgirl13,,0,2023-03-11 23:07:15

We're out of town for the weekend &amp; went to a historical attraction. My husband was taking photos &amp; I was sitting off to the side taking in the view. A lady came up &amp; asked me to take a photo of her &amp; her family. I said ""no, sorry"" &amp; tried to make a joke out of it when I could tell it made her mad. Her husband got pretty rude about it, which made me uncomfortable since no one else was in earshot. 

My husband is a photographer &amp; when we travel will carry around a tri-pod. For obvious (I feel like) reasons, we don't ask anyone to take a photo of us. We just set up the tri-pod &amp; set the timer on the camera. Or, we do like most people &amp; take a selfie with our phones. If someone offers to take our photos, we tell them no thanks. 

But, at various times, people will ask us to take their picture with their phone. To be honest, I/we don't want to touch anyone else's phone. It's probably a bit of germophobia brought on by Covid, tbf. They speak (&amp; spit) into it &amp; take it to the bathroom &amp; sit it who knows where.  It's just gross to me.

Rome (5 days) -&gt; Florence (3 days) -&gt; Cinque Terre (2 days) -&gt; Bologna (2 days) -&gt; Venice (2 days)

One potential adjustment would be removing Bologna altogether and adding a day to both Cinque Terre and Venice. I considered Milan but it seems expensive and boring so not so sure about that one.

travel,"Hi all, New Yorker here!

I have a question regarding the time it would take to get proof of marriage/divorce in time to apply for a passport (we'd be getting the passports expedited).

Mom and I are supposed to be driving up to Canada the first week of June to visit a family friend (who recently moved to Canada) for an event. Both of our passports expired a long while ago so we know we have to apply for brand new ones. I've never been out of the country before so I'm kind of a noob with this stuff, and mom has not been out of the country since the 90s. I believe I'm in the clear, but my mom needs to provide proof of name change since the last name on her ID and Birth Certificate don't match up.

My parents married but have been divorced for over 15 years at this point. When they divorced my mom kept her married name. Since the divorce we moved a couple of times, and basically my mom does not know where her marriage and divorce certificates currently are (we are still looking).

So my questions are:

\- **Do you have to provide both marriage and divorce certificates to apply for a new passport or is it just one or the other?** (My mom has 2 of her old passports, one with her married name and one with her maiden name if that somehow helps at all)

\- **Do any of you know how long it would take to get a copy of the marriage and divorce certificates? What's the fastest method to get them?** My main worry is having them in time to apply for her passport and I'm personally not quite sure how this all works.

I heard you have to go to the County Clerk Office, but when I look online it says ""mail only"". Not sure if that's old from peak pandemic times, but we are going to try calling them/going in on Monday. We can only do this type of stuff on Mondays, so if we can't work out anything this Monday we are going to have to wait until next Monday or the following, and I just don't want to waste weeks just waiting to do this stuff. The mailing process seems really grueling lol. I just personally find it funny how you can order a new copy of your SSN card online with ease, and this type of stuff you have to jump through so many hoops with and deal with people who absolutely hate their jobs and act like you're the worst part of their day, haha.

So if anyone has any info about this, that'd be great! Any/all info is appreciated!

Hello travelers of Reddit!
I'm traveling across several cities in April and May. I‚Äôd like to have a consistent checklist of things that will help me explore each of the different cities. So far it‚Äôs things like: drink their famous drink, use 3 modes of transportation, eat their famous food, find a mural/sculpture/public art, visit their tallest building, attend a live event. 
I kinda think these ideas are a lil boring though. What creative, fun and more whimsical kind of ideas might you all have? If you‚Äôve made a checklist for your own multi city travels, what were your favorite things on the list? 

Other things I‚Äôm curious about:
Any good travel mantras, mottoes etc? What phrases or affirmations do any of you use while traveling to help you remember to embrace the chaos, smell the roses etc?

What kinds of routines do you use while the landscape and people around you are changing but you‚Äôre a creature of comfort who is pushing themself via travel? 

What is a small, lightweight, reasonable, cute, quirky thing to look for in each city to bring back as a souvenir? Some ppl collect shot glasses or magnets from their travels and that‚Äôs just not me. 

A few details if its helpful: I‚Äôll be solo traveling in the north east in VT and PA, then in the south, AL and LA and I‚Äôm traveling to each city by train.

travel,"I flew into Eindhoven (in Holland) this afternoon for a family holiday and got grilled at passport control. I was asked where I was staying/kind of accommodation I was staying in/length of stay and had to show that I had a return ticket booked. I know that things have gotten stricter post Brexit (I did not vote for it fyi) but I‚Äôve been to Europe since Brexit and never had that, I was in Cypress in Nov and they didn‚Äôt ask me anything.

 I also saw some folk in the EU queue who presumably weren‚Äôt Dutch getting a grilling so it wasn‚Äôt just folk with UK passports. I‚Äôve also been to Holland more times than I can remember and it‚Äôs never been so extreme. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs so hardcore at Eindhoven. I‚Äôm not complaining, I‚Äôm white and I understand that getting through passport control without a grilling as standard is a privilege - it just seems very weird.

* Convenient flights between NYC/London or just minimal travel hassle
* Quality of accommodation (incl. proximity to the beach), willing to pay up if needed

I am travelling to DR in June for 2 weeks with my girlfriend. We fly in and out of Punta Cana. We plan to stay in a resort in Punta Cana for 2 or 3 nights at the end of our trip, but other than that, we plan to visit other parts of the country. Below is a rough itinerary.

Day 1: Arrive in Punta Cana

Day 2: Take two buses to get to Las Terrenas in Samana (must switch buses in Santo Domingo).

Day 3 - 4: Explore Las Terrenas and the surrounding area (Salto El Lim√≥n, Playa Ermita√±o, Playa El Mor√≥n etc.)

Day 5 - 6: Travel to Samana town, explore the area and visit Cayo Levantado Beach.

Day 7 - 8: Travel back to Santo Domingo and explore the city.

Day 9 - 10: Travel to San Pedro De Macoris - we want to visit the Ron Barcel√≥ museum and Cave of Wonders from here.

Day 11 - 12: Travel to La Romana and visit Saona Island

Day 12 - 14: Punta Cana

Questions:

1. Are we trying to squeeze in too much and should we consider spending more time in each place?
2. Is it worth travelling further on to Las Galeras instead of staying in Samana town? The beaches nearby Las Galeras look spectacular.
3. Any other general advice or recommendations when visiting DR?

1) at the Asian Airlines I would buy a ticket for 2/19, show up and then the ticket would be for 3/19, so I would have to pay a premium for a last second flight. They did this to me THREE times, the ticket lady even admitted that their systems have been having this issue allot but she couldn‚Äôt do anything, I would have to contact customer service which doesn‚Äôt speak English. 

2) DO NOT buy any international tickets with connecting flights that have less than a 3 hour layover, lots of cheaper tickets only give you 1-2 hour layovers but the flights are often 30min or more late, then baggage claim, security, immigration, sometimes covid things, and then some airports have the connecting terminal so far away that you need to buy a shuttle ticket to make it there.

3) Steer clear of connecting flights in India, if you do not have several hours layover you WILL miss your connection.
The level of stupidity, immaturity and lack of organization was astounding!!!

4) try not to talk with the ticket attendants at the terminals, my wife simply asked if our mobile tickets were ok to use and she then wanted the information on all our flights, when she saw that I didn‚Äôt have a return flight home they forced me to purchase one or I couldn‚Äôt bored the plane.

I need to attend a workshop in Italy, but I'm having trouble getting an Italian visa because I don't have anyone there to invite me. So I applied for a German visa instead, with the plan of staying in Germany for one day before heading to Italy for the workshop. The workshop is a business trip and will last for 5 days.

My question is: is it possible to use my German visa to enter Italy for the workshop, even though the visa was intended for Germany and not Italy? I know that Germany and Italy are both part of the Schengen Area, but I'm not sure if this is allowed.

travel,"I live in Toronto and been thinking for a while about doing a **Canadian Rockies Road Trip**. Finally, this summer is looking ideal. I am planning it as a full 2 week trip and when I counted I **got 16 nights and 15 days** at hand. I'd be flying from **Toronto to Abbotsford, BC** and arrive **Friday evening**. And I have the next two full weeks and the weekends. I found a blog and it has pretty good route map but it's trek heavy and pro-camping. I'd be **renting a car in** Abbotsford airport and dropping off at Edmonton at the last day of the trip.

The blog that I read has the below route and it seems like a good one. But I wanted second opinion and hence posting here.

**The Route:** 

* Arrive Abbotsford BC
* Vancouver (Not in Author's list)
* Squamish
* Whistler
* Wells Gray Prov. Park (via ClearWater)
* Mt. Robson Prov. Park
* Jasper National Park
* Icefields Parkway
* Lake Louise
* The Bow Valley Parkway
* Banff Canmore &amp; Kananaskis Country
* Depart Edmonton

The author of the blog did stops at campsites and did lot of treks and canoeing along the way. With 16 nights and 15 days I have, I am not sure which places should I stop and for how many nights and days to **cover the as much ground** as I can **without missing main or primary attractions** of the above places in a car. And author skipped the Vancouver BC completely and also Calgary and Edmonton. *I'd* *like to cover few tourist attractions in Vancouver and between Calgary and Edmonton but don't mind if I have to skip any places around Calgary and Edmonton*. So I added in the list.

**I noticed that few places are just hour and half drive far from each and will allow you to cover multiple spots if you're smartly put up in one location for more nights at a hotel.**

I'll be travelling with my wife and 6yr old kid and cannot do much trail hiking. Anything to reach by a car is great and will be staying at hotels throughout.

In other words, need all the help I can get to plan this itinerary for the trip.",2 Week Canadian Rockies Road Trip starting from Vancouver BC to Edmonton,,arunkchow,,0,2023-03-10 05:03:39

travel,"Hello everyone,

We have nailed down our ""bookends"" of our honeymoon, ostensibly Vienna/Salzburg/Copenhagen/Stockholm. (I say ostensibly because we might want to add a bit more in there, such as a brief jaunt to Bratislava, but we are trying to be mindful of the fact that we only have 16 days total.) 

However, my husband is interested in non-airplane options from Salzburg (or, if easier, Munich) to Copenhagen. This is in part because he has a bit of a fear of flying. It is not enough to prevent him from doing so, and he mostly copes with the fear by ordering a glass of whiskey! I have assured him that airplane travel within Europe will be way quicker and easier than our trips across the Atlantic anyway, and he gets that on an intellectual level but is still a bit more bullish about train and/or car travel than I am. We will already be driving from Vienna to Salzburg, which I would imagine to be beautiful - let me know of any cities in between those that you recommend for a stopping point!

Even Munich to Copenhagen seems to be about 12 hours via train, which is staggeringly long and would bore us quickly, even with the requisite pre-downloaded Netflix queue and other amusements. I thought of an overnight train, but I am wondering if you know of any through Germany besides Snelltaget? I only found that Swedish train as the main option (the private compartments don't have their own bathrooms!), but I've seen some from OBB here and there. Would either be a suitable choice?

The other idea is a road trip through Germany, but I feel that Germany is very much a country to discover in a trip of its own. I've been to Berlin, my husband to Munich, and I don't want to zip through Germany in one day while having severe FOMO, knowing that I love Berlin.

A less formed, barely-there idea is a ferry from Germany to Denmark. Does anyone have experience with those?

Of course, we may indeed just fly from one point to another ;) But I am wondering what you think/what your experiences are with the aforementioned options? Thanks so much!",Inter-European Travel: Mostly Germany...Non-Airplane??,,blergyblergy,,1,2023-03-09 21:12:19

After I came back home, they asked me if we're going to that European trip.
Itold them that i wanted to visit the UK again since my visa will expire soon and not go to the European trip.
They are a british citizen and they could go anywhere any where I have to always apply for a visa.
told them that we can go visit another part of the UK and they were saying how they want to go Europe and not taking into consideration that i have to get a visa for both trips. They also were picking the cities to visit and planning to stay in hotels. I want something affordable (hostels etc.) but they didn't want to.
I told them that I have to pass on and come to

We were suppose to go you Puerto Rico, spent all our extra money to treat ourselves to a trip. My SO and I booked a more expensive and direct flight from Boston to San Juan Puerto Rico. The direct flight was then switched to include a layover to Orlando with a 1 hour window to catch the connecting flight. The flight to Orlando was delayed multiple times, with no staff members to answer questions, literally had one person walk away from us mid asking for clarification. Now we won‚Äôt get to Orlando until after 12, we are missing 2 payed days for our Airbnb in Puerto Rico, and now we have to figure out how to afford the night in Orlando, while trying to get on another flight to Puerto Rico. On top of that, I shit you not there wasn‚Äôt a single Spirit airlines person at the gate until 20 min AFTER the board said we were going to take off. 

To make myself feel better I complained on their instagram and they responded trying to fix it. I explained the story, they implied it was my fault because I accepted the layover (but I didn‚Äôt accept the layovers that wouldn‚Äôt get us there on time, only the previous ones that were still going to work), and then they offered my SO and me a $50 voucher to our next spirit airlines flight that expires in may. It‚Äôs almost comedic at this point.

(I also can‚Äôt believe that they broke my spirit so much that I payed for WiFi to try to relax for once today)

Edit: it got worse...they put my girlfriend and I on two different flights to get us to PR, 24 hours apart to get us there Friday at midnight (we originally payed to get there on Wednesday by 7 pm). They were trying to send me back from Orlando to Philadelphia to get a flight to San Juan. They had no other tickets available since they oversell tickets...had to cancel and book with jet blue to get to the island,  but now they are trying to refuse our refund because they did find us a way to get there (through Philadelphia).

1) Is two weeks enough for Mozambique? I'm particularly interested in diving, hiking, would like to go off the beaten path a little and also take in the culture there. 

2) If you've been to Mozambique, did you get to meet a lot of other backpackers/go on adventures with them? This is not the sole purpose of me travelling there but would be a bonus for sure

I am the only vegetarian in this group of friends. I‚Äôm wondering how accommodating the restaurants are of veggie options or if I need to plan back up food options at the store as my main source of food? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

travel,"Hi all! 

Been searching around and not sure if I‚Äôve gotten an answer just yet, but have been wondering if visiting most of the Europe/Schengen area is visa free for US citizens? Everything I‚Äôve searched said I don‚Äôt need any visas for any of the countries I‚Äôm visiting (listed below) but haven‚Äôt gotten a straight answer on if I‚Äôm required to apply for a Schengen visa. 
Wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to be given trouble for not having a Schengen visa considering the amount of countries I‚Äôm visiting. Supposedly from some of the sites I‚Äôm reading, the Schengen visa won‚Äôt be needed till 2024?

Is this something I should be needing to have before arriving in the EU or should I be fine with my US passport? Thought I did all my research but there‚Äôs a part of my brain that wonders if I‚Äôm missing something due to me being in the EU just a day after 30 days. 

Duration of stay: 
Total= 31 days (longest stay in any one country 8 days)

Extra info: Would like to add that we are not renting a car, my boyfriend speaks Spanish (I don't but I am in lessons), and  we don't drink/go to bars. We love local food more then restaurant food. And the budget is $3,000.

What we liked about it, was there were 5 different pools to choose from. One of the pools was on the beach at a beach club so you had access to a restaurant. You could also ride bikes to all the pools and other nearby towns. Golf carts are also a popular mode of transportation. 

So my question, what other areas across the U.S. have access to different pools, near the ocean and are able to bike to other nearby towns for restaurants. Thank you!","Similar to Watercolor, Santa Rosa Beach, FL",,Rocksc13,,0,2023-03-09 12:01:44

So basically me and my boyfriend are travelling from the UK to the US in a few weeks. We filed out our ESTA and got approved, but we realised after that we answered the transit question wrong, the question being ‚ÄúIs your travel to the US occurring in transit to another country?‚Äù
We said yes, when in fact the answer is no as we will be staying in the US for our trip.

I‚Äôve already asked the US immigration service via email if we need a new ESTA, they said no. But we are still a bit nervous about it, so I just need confirmation that they won‚Äôt refuse us at the border? Has anyone had experience with this?

travel,"Me and 3 other people just booked a 14 day Croatia trip. We'll be flying into Zagreb at the tail end of August and then leaving from Zagreb a couple weeks into September. Our group wants to spend a lot of time outdoors doing water activities, sight seeing, and soaking up the culture as much as possible. It shuld be noted, we don't mind longer trips in the car. As americans we drive to get everywhere, and road trips are common for us. Here's my current 14 day itinerary:

* Day 1: Land in Zagreb around 13:00. Get a rental car and hit the road, heading for Istria. Arrive in Rovinj by the evening. (google maps says it's a 3 hr drive, let's assume 4 to be safe.) 
* Day 2: see Rovinj
* Day 3: Wake up early and leave Rovinj, drive to Plitvices (3-4 hr drive). Hang out at the park for the rest of the day. Stay nearby overnight.
* Day 4: Depending on if we got our fill, either leave the area or spend more time at the park and then leave for Zadar. (2-3 hr drive). Zadar for the rest of the day.
* Day 5: See more of Zadar
* Day 6: Perhaps drive up to Pag or one of the other islands you can access via car. Go to a winery, maybe swim. Head back to Zadar.
* Day 7: Leave Zadar for Split. (2-3 hr drive). Drop car off in split right away at the rental place, then board a ferry for Hvar. Ferry to Hvar, there by afternoon/evening.
* Day 8: Hvar
* Day 9: Hvar/Island hopping excursions
* Day 10: Depending on how our crew has fared on the water so far (we have some that can get affected by motion sickness), either take a ferry from Hvar to Dubronvik, or if that's not looking good take a ferry back to Split and then board a bus for Dubronvik. Either way, this will be a few hour journey. Once in Durbonvik, we board another bus for Kotor, essentially bypassing Dubronvik altogether. Arrive in Kotor by the evening.
* Day 11: Kotor
* Day 12: Kotor/see the bay/maybe rent bikes etc.
* Day 13: Bus back to Dubronvik, then take a 1 hr flight up to Zagreb. Land in Zagreb by the evening, find a place to stay near the airport.
* Day 14: Back to airport to fly home.

There's definitely a lot of moving around, which I see even more clearly as I type this out. We're not not used to that though, we recently had a trip (that we enjoyed) on which we stayed 8 different places in 11 nights. This doesn't touch that level of moving around haha. All that being said, does the traveling we have tentatively planned work in a country like Croatia? Any things we should consider? Any changes you'd suggest? Is skipping Dubronvik a good idea? From what I've read it's extremely touristy and busy, and aesthetically it seems a bit redundant with the other coastal towns/cities. The only musts on our itinerary are: Plitvices, exploring some islands, good swimming, and Kotor.

travel,"Hi,

My wife and I (from Australia) are planning a large trip starting September. We haven‚Äôt settled on a time frame yet (likely 3 months) but have our destinations planned:

Edinburgh &gt; London &gt; Paris &gt; Grindelwald &gt; Milan &gt; Rome &gt; Venice &gt; Munich &gt; Budapest &gt; Krakow &gt; Warsaw &gt; Berlin &gt; Amsterdam. 

We are thinking about getting a eurail pass, but have heard reviews that it gets very expensive with the seat bookings (or sleeper cabins etc). We have also heard that it can get confusing booking the seats as you sometimes need to go to the train station to book it first? 

I‚Äôm thinking our trip is spread wide enough that we would see value in the pass, but want to be certain. There is a sale on right now and we are thinking about locking it down now. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you",Eurail pass,,thr0away20,,0,2023-03-09 03:34:24

travel,"Any recommendations for a family friendly resort located on the beach on the gulf side of Florida?   I'm thinking Tampa/Clearwater/St. Petersburg since I can get a direct flight in/out of Tampa.  Our go-to has always been the Pink Shell in Fort Meyers Beach, but it is still recovering from Hurricane Ian.  We'd be going end of July/early August.

Children are 14 and 11.  What we liked about pink shell:

* We could get a two bedroom suite. 
* Right on the beach
* Large Pool
* Other families around with kids.

Less important things that made our stays nice:

* Awesome breakfast included
* You could order alcoholic drinks on the beach 
* Jet Ski / Kayak / etc rentals right there on the beach
* Marina with Pontoon boat rentals
* Restaurants on site.
* Located on the gulf, so I liked that water was shallow (you could walk out far) and the water seemed calmer than Atlantic side.

I am considering a trip to a few places in Africa this summer and wondering what vaccinations and medicines I might need, if any. 

My hope is to do 4 days in Egypt for the pyramids/sphinx/etc, then about 8 days in S Africa split between a few days in Cape Town, an excursion from there to swim with Great Whites, and a Safari in the region for Big 5.

Then on the way back up to Europe, I would stop in Morocco for 3 days.

I'm not sure what shots/pills might be necessary or if at all. 

In Egypt I think I'd mostly be in the city center other than when seeing the pyramids, and Morocco also I'd stay in the heart of Marrakesh, and not venture out into rural areas or etc. In S Africa, I'd be in Cape Town for most of it, however, as said, I'd likely be on Safari in one of the game reserves for 4 days or so.

So last year I bought a 40L backpack and used it in conjunction with a carry on.  However, I had a couple issues after a 3 week trip to Europe:  


1) I found 40L is TOO big.  I actually overpacked and brought stuff I didn't need with me.

2) The pack I used was more tech focused, so lots of spaces for laptops and tablets, etc, but not great for just general items.  


I'm looking at some new packs to replace it and looking for suggestions.  Something around 20L would probably be better, something with a slot for a laptop, but less tech focused and more general purpose.  Water resistant is preferred as I'd be using this for a day to day pack at home as well (it rains a lot where I live).  Anyone have any suggestions they use?

* I know it's quite a few locations within a short period of time. I also keep reading to cut down on the locations, so we are open to hearing out of the places listed, which one would you cut out? 
* We aren't sure on the Germany location, Frankfurt seems to be in line on the map, but we don't have anything specific to see there, so that is where we may want to cut a destination. 
* Are there other places we should be seeing in these countries? If so, what and why? 
* Krakow is non-negotiable. We want to go to Auschwitz for a day from Krakow, along with visiting some family in the area. 
* My other questions are, how do we get around? Everything I read says cheap flights and trains, but what trains and what airlines do you recommend? What are easy to navigate? How far out can we book tickets for places to stay/trains/airlines? 
* Any articles that you think would be beneficial to read when planning a trip in Europe on our own?

travel,"I wanted to share my recent passport application experience in the hopes that it may help someone who is feeling stressed about the process.

**Here are some quick notes:**

* Appointment location: Denver
* Appointment date: January 18th, 2023
* Delivered in hand: March 9th, 2023
* Date of trip: March 13th, 2023
* Expedited services: everything
* Total time: 50 days from appointment
* Passport type - First-Time Applicant 
* Times checked application status on travel.state.gov: 100+
* Locator number: 69 New Hampshire
* Shipping location: Tucson, AZ

**Here's a timeline of what happened:**

* **January 18th, 2023:** Passpoint appointment at 2:00 PM
* **January 20th, 2023:** Passports arrive at the 69 location in New Hampshire
* **February 13th, 2023:** I receive an email from NH Passport Center that the birth certificate was not sufficient. The document gave instructions on how to mail the correct birth certificate to the center. Mainly to provide the long-form certificate with the ""I"" indicator.
* **February 14th, 2023:** I ordered the long-form passport through vitalchek.com and paid for the expedited shipping.
* **February 17th, 2023:** I receive the birth certificate from UPS and sign for it. I immediately take the new birth certificate to UPS to next day air it to New Hampshire.
* **February 20th, 2023:** The new Hampshire Pass Port Center receives the package.
* **March 3rd, 2023:** I reach out to Senator Diana DeGette's office of Denver and submitted a passport support form through her website.
* **March 6th, 2023:** One of Senator Diana DeGette's staff members reaches out and is very reassuring. The person on the phone said they were sending out a request for an update and discussed a possible urgent appointment at the Aurora Passport Center.
* **March 7th, 2023:** Around 10 PM, passport status is updated to APPROVED.
* **March 8th, 2023:** 8:00 AM, I check the status and it says it's SHIPPED with a tracking number. The estimated delivery is **March 9th by 6:00 PM**.
* **March 13th, 2023:** Date of travel at 9:00 AM, flight to Cabo out of Denver.

I do plan on spending two weeks this summer in Italy or Greece, but a quick four day trip to Paris (from the US) sounds fun to me.

travel,"Hi All,

My uncle recently bought a ticket from SJO-FRA-BER-ZRH-JFK-EWR-SJO. They're not the most intuitive with travel and they bought their tickets with a travel agency online. 

Unfortunately, they didn't realize that the connection in the US happens between two different airports. One arrives at JFK at 1:05PM and then the next one departs from EWR at 5:00PM, which is also an international flight.

I'm familiar with the area and I know that it takes a good hour plus on a good day to get from JFK-EWR by Uber. I also know that passing through Border and Customs really depends on the airport and timing, I've spent from 25 minutes going through Border Control and up to 3 hours at some airports.

My gut is telling me that they won't make their connection at EWR. And even if they go through border and customs, they will make it at best 1 or 2 hours before their flight.

What are the thoughts around this? They can't change their flight and their travel agency basically told me tough luck since it was clearly stated that there was an airport change. 

If it helps, flights were booked through Lufthansa. SJO-FRA is Lufthansa, BER-ZRH is Swiss, ZRH-JFK is Swiss and EWR-SJO is United.

My wife and I are a couple of 35+ year Aussies thinking of taking a gap year to travel around the States.

Intention at this stage is to fly to Canada and buy a van, deck it out and then drive into the US on a B-2 visa.

Sometime during our trip, we'll request to extend it for another six months, drive back to Canada, sell, and fly home.

Does anyone see any issue with this? I've been reading a bit about the extension process but no idea if any of it is different if we were to cross in via Canada.

travel,"I searched Google for this, however the results I found were mostly about holiday, and sometimes student visas.

in 2021, still during the COVID restrictions, I was set to come back to Europe (EU citizen) and I overstayed for 4 days. There staff at the airport didn't really make any deal out of it, just gave me some papers to fill out, it was a bit lenghty but it just seemed like it was some standard procedure and then I was free to go.

I didn't think much of it until I heard something about a 2 year entry ban on overstaying. My dream ever since was to come back for a holiday, and this had me worried, but I like I said I couldn't find information relevant to me, so I wanted to seek some help here. By the time I visit again two years would pass anyway, but not knowing the exact rules would make me stressed for sure.

travel,"**The first two paragraphs are about Nepal, after that is about Tibet and Pakistan** 

Hi everyone, I am currently in Southeast Asia but was considering flying to Nepal in early April. However, I am reconsidering that plan because of the new rule that all foreign tourists must hire a guide when trekking. I am on a somewhat stringent budget, and I also just prefer hiking without a guide. I've done it a couple times before, and I generally find the cons outweigh the pros. 

The above regulations I mentioned come into effect on April 1st. Because of this, I am considering trying to get a flight into Nepal in late March. I would likely not be able to arrive until after, at the earliest, March 20th. So, I would still be there and trekking in April. I'm not sure what I hope to learn, but I am just curious if anyone who has been there before has any input on how they think this new system will be policed. I know there is some sort of card you need to register for if you plan to hike, I was wondering what that process is like, is it possible that is where they will verify you are booked with a registered guiding company? Or perhaps some other early step. I think you need to register for hikes like the Annapurna Circuit, maybe it would be checked there. I suppose I'm just looking for feedback on whether or not there is the chance that I might get stopped if I'm half way through the Annapurna Circuit when the new regulations come into effect on April first. I assume they don't have the infrastructure to police every town along the way, but I wondered if people who had been there knew or thought otherwise. 

Alternatively, I'm considering flying to **Tibet** or North **Pakistan**. My concern with both of those places to an extent is the infrastructure. Because my visiting the Himalaya's is an unplanned departure from Southeast Asia, I have no camping gear, and I don't really want to ship it from half way across the globe where I live. Are there multi-day hikes in Tibet or North Pakistan where I would be able to stay in guesthouses along the way, or would I need to think about buying or renting camping gear? 

In addition to that concern, I was wondering about the temperature. Nepal sounded nice, but North Pakistan sounded colder in April, and Tibet also sounded a bit colder. Are some of the best treks still doable in April without a ton of cold weather gear? 

Finally, from anyone who's been there, how is the transportation? Both countries seem to have less tourist infrastructure than Nepal, certainly North Pakistan more than Tibet. So I was wondering if anyone had any info on that. 

Finally, I'm just looking for advice if anyone has any for those countries. I will undoubtable get to one of them some time in the future. Thanks in advance!",Advice on visiting Nepal vs Tibet or Pakistan and trekking the Himalaya's in general,,makeshiftswift,,1,2023-03-08 09:25:03

travel,"I am giving some serious thought to taking a trip to Europe and using repositioning cruises to get there and back, one that takes off from New York and arrives in Rome on May 6th and then another that leaves from Barcelona on May 29th to return to the States.  This post is to get opinions and recommendations on the time that would present me.

It's fairly short notice, given that this is only about a month away at this point, but I'm trying to see if I can fill that 3 weeks between the cruises with something interesting without breaking the bank.  (Ideally between 100-200 dollars a day, and preferably on the lower end.)  Other cruises are a consideration and I've identified a few that are possibilities, but I'm actually a bit more interested in whether there are any reputable and affordable groups that might be a good fit for something like this to see more of the interior of Europe.  I typically travel alone, but that is generally for a week or two at a time and I could see the isolation being a bit much if I'm doing a solid two months.

Some relevant factors in what I'm looking for:

* Ideally more cultural, historical, and maybe gastronomical in terms of activities; I don't really drink, so I've never been into the party scene.  Something active and exploring nature could be fun as well, but probably isn't the point when you're in Europe; it would be a nice addition though (i.e. biking around cities to see the sites rather than just getting on a bus)
* I'm in my early 40s, adult male and fairly used to solo travel.  I've been to Europe once before, hitting London for a few days, Paris for a few days, Barcelona briefly, and then a Mediterranean cruise that was mostly Italy with a bit of France.
* I like having most of my costs out front as I'm pretty frugal and unexpected expenses sour the experience for me.  I've also considered trying to find a travel agent to see what they could do for me, as this seems like the kind of trip they would actually be helpful on, but again not particularly sure about finding a reputable one.
* Hostels seem to be the standard ""cheap"" travel option, but honestly, I tend to travel with a lot of electronics and I'd be worried about theft, so ideally the group travel would include individual rooms.

In general, the reason I'm posting is to get any suggestions people have for groups and/or travel agents, as well as to see if anyone has any similar trips that they've taken and how it went for them.  Given the audience here, I'm guessing most would say to go for it on actually taking the trip, but any warnings or other considerations I might not be thinking about would be good to hear as well.  (Or even other options for European travel that might be more value-- the repositioning cruises aren't breaking the bank for a solid month of cruising, but together they're about $3000.  I am also considering just catching a flight back, as the second cruise hits less than half the ports and is the more expensive of the two.)","European Vacation - 3 Weeks in May, Recommendations?",,Balthanon,,0,2023-03-08 07:32:55

So far: I will be flying into Gothenburg, Sweden on Sept. 19, and intend to spend the first several days of my trip exploring the archipelago (and having some quiet/slower time to deal with jet lag). 

I plan to leave for Copenhagen / plan a day trip to Malm√∂ around Sept 23rd. 

After that, it gets a little complicated. It looks like, to see Stockholm, I‚Äôd have to double back, and then take the train back down to Germany a few days later. The way I‚Äôm imagining it now:

Sept 26th: head to Stockholm. 

Sept 29th: take train from Stockholm to Berlin. 

Depart home from Berlin Oct 4.

Months ago I booked flights to Portugal, via the TAP website - long enough ago the details are fuzzy. But, nothing seemed askance at the time, and I did not screenshot the confirmation page. I did however get an email from them (subject: Booking confirmation email) that had a reference number, my name and Visa noted (number not included), a total price, the flights, and the name of the people on the flights. The email in no way indicated any further action was required, and I never got another email (eg telling me about a payment failure.) The email was not a ""pay to hold these flights at this price"" email - it had no mention of anything of that nature.

24 hours before the flight, we go to check in...the reference number (using two factor authentication) pulls up the names but no flights or dates. On the app, it says no booking. 

We call TAP and they say the flights dont exist as they were never paid for. I have sent them screen caps of their confirmation email, and of their website FAQ that says a confirmation email is how I know the flight has been paid for and confirmed. 

We are 20 hours from takeoff (in another city). I have contacted them via email, Twitter and Facebook, and have asked they honour our reservations (if there was a payment problem, we are happy to pay the price we had thought we paid months ago - I'll try to sort out credit card records tomorrow to see if they are right and a payment didn't go through.)

Recently we had lunch and he offered to pay for my plane tickets and hotels to travel with him to Seoul. I told him I‚Äôll think about it but I‚Äôm leaning towards a no - mainly because I would feel guilty for not paying myself and would feel like I‚Äôm taking advantage of a friend.

Just want to hear from others if the timeline sounds practical or plain stupid. 

Head from London around 3am to eventually end up in Luxembourg for a night (passing through Belgium in the process) This is around a 7/8 hour drive. 

Go from Luxembourg to Zermatt, Switzerland the next morning. Again this is around 7/8 hours. 

We‚Äôll be looking to spend 2 nights in Zermatt. 

After Zermatt we‚Äôll be looking to head for Como, Italy for a further 2 nights. This should take around 4 hours. 

From Como we‚Äôll be heading to Monaco for 5 nights (we‚Äôve been to Monaco before and 5 nights is a long time but we‚Äôll look too pitch up and enjoy ourselves in surrounding areas)

After 5 nights in Monaco we‚Äôll start our return trip and head to Lyon. This should be around 5 or hours. 

From Lyon, we‚Äôll be looking to head to Paris the next morning. Again a further 5 hours. 

The final stretch will be from Paris back to Calais, then of course eventually into London. 

It‚Äôs estimated at around 34 hours driving across 13 days. Is this pure overkill or does it sound reasonable?

travel,"In April, my parents are going to travel to UAE, and have been very excited to explore these places. All in all, they have 3 days in Abu Dhabi and 12 days in Dubai. They are in their 50's. The budget is kinda low, so I am looking mostly for inexpensive options. And only my mom can speak very basic but conversational English, so everything is counted on her English speaking skills and judgment if situations ask for it (Although, I will be helping as much as I can ). I don't have any experience in traveling for vacations abroad, and for them, it is their only 2nd time. But they are counting on me to plan their trip, and I also want to do that and make their trip as enjoyable as I can. 

This is the rough outline of the plan for Dubai as they are concentrating on that for the most part. 

Day 1: Visit Burj Khalifa and Palm Jumeirah. Entry tickets cost 40 USD and 20 USD.

Day 2: Relax and swim at Jumeirah Open Beach

Day 3: Visit the aquarium in Dubai for 36 USD

Day 4: Visit Miracle Garden 20 USD

Day 5: Ride on a camel in the desert (33 USD)/ Ride on a yacht. (33 USD)

Day 6: Relax and swim at Jumeirah Open Beach

Day 7: Visit the traditional markets in the first half of the day | watch the famous dancing fountain show in the evening \[ Walk day\]

Day 8: Visit the Museum of future 41USD

Day 9: Visit butterfly Garden 16 USD

Day 10: Visit Dubai Mall

Day 11: Go to a beach

Day 12: undecided

The costs of entry tickets are taken from [getyourguide.com](https://getyourguide.com). And should I book their tickets from the website, or are they available to be purchased at the entrance of most of these places? And will there be a cost difference or waiting a long time in a queue?

For the most part, they are going to eat breakfast in the hotel, probably lunch at the place they are visiting, and then go back to their place and dine at a cafe or restaurant. 

So, as you can see all these places are very good, however, the tickets x2 are going to become very expensive. As well, most of their money has gone to flight tickets and accommodation.

As for public transportation, they are probably going to purchase a city card and ride on the metro and after that simply walk or get by bus. 

Are there any free walk tours in the city center (and is it even possible to walk?).

What kind of historical places would you recommend exploring, too?

Their dates of travel coincide with Ramadan, so I am curious about what kind of changes are going to be there in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

27M going to Prague for 3 nights in May. I'm looking for a really social hostel that has activities in the day but also goes out at night.

It seems like there a lot of good options in Prague, I've whittled it down to Madhouse or Hostel one home.

Does anyone have experience with either? Madhouse seems to come up most when looking for party hostels, but then Hostel one also seems to have events every night as far as I can see.

I'm a bit worried that Madhouse will be a bit of a chad vibe and be the kind of place that takes you to tacky bars and clubs.
